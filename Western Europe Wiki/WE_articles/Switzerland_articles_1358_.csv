== Early life ==
Koch was born Ursula Pomeranz on 1 July 1941 in Zurich, Switzerland to a stateless Jewish father originally from Poland and Swiss-born Maria Elisabeth Pomeranz (née Hanhart; 1914-2004).She grew up in Stäfa on Lake Zürich and graduated from the teacher training college there before spending a year on exchange at the University of Oregon in 1962. In 1963, Ursula Koch started to study natural sciences at the University of Zürich and graduated at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, where she worked as a research assistant from 1970 to 1976. Ursula Koch received her doctorate in 1976.


== Political career ==


=== Cantonal Council and City Council of Zurich ===
As member of the Cantonal Council (Kantonsrat), the legislative assembly of the canton of Zürich, for the SP of the canton of Zürich, Ursula Koch refused, as dedicated woman's politician, the traditional male-oriented oath to the Vaterland and instead pledged allegiance on the Mutterland of office in 1979, but was re-elected until 1986.Beginning in 1986, Ursula Koch was voted as member of the Zürich City Councillor (Stadtrat), the executive board of the city of Zürich. She acted as superintendent of the engineering department (Bauamt II or Hochbaudepartment), i.e. Ursula Koch was responsible for all building construction works in Zürich until 1998. Ursula Koch opposed intensively the opening of the former industrial zones for the construction of more commerce buildings, in favor of more accommodation buildings at moderate prizes; therefore her statement ""City (of Zürich) is built"" (in German: Die Stadt Zürich ist gebaut!) on 16 March 1988 to the members of the SIA association, the parent organization of Swiss engineers and architects, became her best-known saying.At the 1999 national Council elections, Ursula Koch reached with 122,846 votes the second best result in Switzerland. Despite the top result, the inner-party disputes not declined. As Nationalrätin for the SP party, Ursula Koch was voted by the citizens of the canton Zürich as member of the Nationalrat, the Swiss lower parliament's house, from 6 December 1999 to 10 May 2000, when she resigned for reasons of health.


=== President of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP) ===
On 28 June 1997 Ursula Koch was elected by the members of the SP Switzerland at an extraordinary party congress in Thun, and won, despite lack of political experience at the national level, against Andrea Hämmerle, and succeeded the popular but controversy longyear SP president Peter Bodenmann. From 1997 to April 2000, Ursula Koch was the president of the SP, even being the first women president of the national section of the Swiss social democratic party (SP).
After her election as president of the party, Ursula Koch encountered massive rejection of their person, according to own information, and the conflict took place increasingly via media reaching its first peak in March 1998, when the general secretary Barbara Häring resigned. Party colleagues of the so-called ""Bodenmann-Clan"" (named after the previous party president) criticized an increasing lack of concept and the absence of the SP in the Swiss political arena. The crisis culminated after a closed-door meeting of the SP executive board on 19 February 2000: the reconciliation within the party leadership did not materialise, and on 15 April Ursula Koch retired by the party leadership and from the parliament due to health reasons.As president of the political party SP, and therefore member of the so-called Elefantenrunde – meaning the presidents of the five most 'important' political parties in Switzerland – Ursula Koch participated at the first live stream broadcast from the Federal Palace of Switzerland (Bundeshaus) in late 1999.Since 2000, she is no more charged in a political office, and in November 2000 Ursula Koch married her long-time life partner.

30,"Doris Leuthard (born 10 April 1963) is a Swiss politician and lawyer who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2006 to 2018. A member of the Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), she was elected as President of the Swiss Confederation for 2010 and 2017. Leuthard headed the Federal Department of Economic Affairs until 2010, when she became head of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications. As of 19 December 2019 she is a member of the board of the Kofi Annan Foundation and Stadler Rail.


== Biography ==
Leuthard was a member of the Swiss National Council from 1999 to 2006 for the canton of Aargau. She presided over the Christian Democratic People's Party from 2004 to 2006. Following the resignation of Joseph Deiss from the Swiss Federal Council, Leuthard was elected as his successor on 14 June 2006. She received 133 out of 234 valid votes to become the 109th Federal Councillor. She is the fifth woman elected to the Federal Council. Her election represented a departure from a long precedent of replacing a Member of the Federal Council with someone from the same language group. While Deiss was a French speaker, Leuthard is a German speaker.
From 1 August 2006 until 31 October 2010, she was head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs. On 1 November 2010 she became head of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, succeeding Moritz Leuenberger. For the calendar year 2009, Leuthard was elected Vice President of the Swiss Confederation, virtually assuring her election as President of the Confederation for the calendar year 2010. Due to a large amount of turnover on the Federal Council in recent years, she was the longest-serving Federal Councillor not to have served as the body's president.
She was elected President of the Confederation for 2010 and 2017. She became the third woman to hold the post, after Ruth Dreifuss (1999) and Micheline Calmy-Rey (2007). As President of the Confederation, Leuthard presided over meetings of the Federal Council and carried out representative functions that would normally be handled by a head of state in other democracies (though in Switzerland, the Federal Council as a whole is regarded as the head of state). She was also the highest-ranking official in the Swiss order of precedence and had the power to act on behalf of the whole Federal Council in emergency situations. However, in most cases, Leuthard was merely primus inter pares, with no power above and beyond her six colleagues.
She was succeeded by Calmy-Rey in 2011, the first time two women held the office in succession. Following a reshuffle of portfolios after the by-election of two new Federal Councillors in 2010, Leuthard replaced outgoing Moritz Leuenberger at the head of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications. In her capacity as minister, she was appointed by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres in 2018 to the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, co-chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma.The project SAFFA 2020 is under the patronage of the three Federal Councillors: Leuthard, Simonetta Sommaruga and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, as well as by the former Federal Councillor Calmy-Rey.In July 2022, Swiss media reported that Doris Leuthard was the victim of aggression by her husband in their vacation home in Ticino. Her husband has been detained in a psychiatric prison by the Swiss police because of the chance of recidivism.

41,"Lisa Mazzone (born 25 January 1988) is a prominent Green Party politician in Switzerland. She was elected to the Swiss parliament (""Nationalrat"" / ""Cussegl naziunal"") on 18 October 2015, becoming Switzerland's youngest member of parliament in the process. Most of her political interventions to date have involved environmental issues.


== Provenance ==
Lisa Mazzone was born in Geneva, the largest city in the francophone western part of Switzerland. She grew up in nearby Versoix, where she attended school and where until 2011 Luigi Mazzone, her father, Sergio Mazzone, served as a city councillor, representing the ""Geneva Ecologist Party"" (""Parti écologiste de Genève""). He is also a retired installer of solar panels. Her mother died in 2013: she had worked as a psychiatrist. Three of Lisa Mazzone's four grand parents emigrated from Italy to work at the CERN (""European Organization for Nuclear Research"" / ""Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire"") which occupies a large site straddling the Franco-Swiss frontier a short distance to the north of Geneva. Along with her Swiss passport she also carries an Italian passport. Her paternal grandmother, born Beatrice Gmur, who also worked at the CERN, came originally from St. Gallen, a politically conservative canton in eastern Switzerland.


== Parliaments ==
In 2006, aged 18, Mazzone took part in the establishment of the Youth Parliament (""parlement des jeunes"") at Versoix. She became a member of the national committee of the Swiss Federation of Youth Parliament in 2007/08. She joined the Green Party in 2008. She served as president of the Geneva party between March 2014 and March 2016. She then became Party Vice-President for the Suisse Romande region in succession to Robert Cramer on 16 April 2016.


== Bicycles and transport ==
Many of the slopes around the foreshore at the western end of Lake Geneva are reassuringly gentle: Lisa Mazzone became a passionate advocate for cycling when she was barely a teenager. She worked as a co-ordinator for the Geneva Pro-Vélo association between 2010 and 2014. In 2014 she stepped down from that job in order to become Project Manager with the association. Since April 2015 she has also been vice-president at the ""National Association for Transportation and the Environment"" (""Association transports et environnement""). She has subsequently become the association's president for the francophone region surrounding Geneva.


== Political representative ==
Mazzone sat as a municipal councillor (""Conseil communal"") in Le Grand-Saconnex - the multi-cultural central Geneva municipality which includes both the city airport and several major United Nations facilities within its boundaries - from 2011 till June 2013. 2013 was also  the year in which she graduated from the University of Geneva with a Bachelor en Lettres degree in Latin and French. As she later explained to an interviewer, that was when she decided to devote herself 100% to her favourite pastime, political and social (""associatif"") engagement.  Later that year, on 6 October 2013, she was elected to membership of the Grand Council of Geneva (""Grand Conseil de Genève"" / cantonal parliament) for the five-year term ending in 2018. The 2013 election had left the Green Party with just 10 of the 100 Grand Council seats. Within the Geneva parliament she was a member of the transport commission and of the energy commission, becoming chair of the latter in December 2014. In March 2014 she had become leader of the Green Party team.


== Stop bunkers ==
Because of the country's exceptionally precautionary cold war era building regulations, far more Swiss homes and offices feature their own underground nuclear bunkers than equivalent buildings elsewhere in Western Europe. In February 2015 Lisa Mazzone came to prominence as a leader in the Grand Council of a small group of deputies supporting the so-called ""stop bunkers"" movement.   The issue concerned the extent to which the city authorities, in defiance of building regulations stating that premises with a floor below ground level could not be used as living accommodation, had been using nuclear bunkers to accommodate asylum seekers. The ""stop bunkers"" protesters included (but were not restricted to) asylum seekers being accommodated underground who were complaining about lack of sunshine or ventilation, terrible and rotting food, the impossibility of sleeping under the 24-hour lighting and in the noisy conditions, and the indestrucability of the bed bugs.


== National parliament ==
Lisa Mazzone was elected to the Swiss parliament (""Conseil national"" / ""Consiglio Nazionale"") on 18 October 2015, becoming Switzerland's youngest member of parliament. She delivered her ten-minute maiden speech to the National Council on 30 November  2015, which was her first day in the parliament. Under the relevant cantonal legislation, election to the national parliament had meant resignation from the Grand Council of Geneva on 12 November 2015.   At the time of her election she told an interviewer:

""My orientation, based on my personal values, moves me towards considerations about free time and about sharing - as regards 'things', wealth and knowledge. It is time to move on from the strict focus on economic productivity which prevails  today  ...  the [political] left must launch its own initiatives, projects and referendums, and not spend its time on the defensive"".In October 2018 Mazzone announced that in the 2019 national elections she would stand not for re-election to the National Council (""Conseil national"" - lower house) but as a candidate for election to the Council of States (Switzerland) (""Conseil des États"" / ""Cussegl dals Stadi""), which is the upper house of the national parliament.   The relationship between the two chambers of the Swiss national parliament is roughly analogous to that between the German Bundesrat (upper house) and Bundestag (lower house).   In the elections for the ""Conseil des États"" she is hoping to win the seat made vacant by the recently announced retirement from the chamber of her party colleague Robert Cramer. The elections in question are scheduled for October 2019.


== Beyond parliament ==
Much of Lisa Mazzone's most visible political activity still takes place outside parliament. She chairs the organisation ""Regional Co-ordination for a Geneva city airport respectful of the environment and of the residents"" (""Coordination régionale pour un aéroport de Genève urbain, respectueux de l'environnement et de la population"" / CARPE) which in December 2016 tabled a cantonal ""people's initiative"", backed by 14,450 signatures, calling for ""democratic control in respect of Geneva airport"" (""Pour un pilotage démocratique de l'aéroport de Genève"").She is co-president, along with Priska Seiler Graf of the Social Democratic Party in Zürich, of the ""Environment and Health Coalition for responsible air transport"" (""Coalition environnement et santé pour un transport aérien responsable"" / CESAR) created in September 2016 by 20 like-minded Swiss associations and organisations. In March 2017 she became one of two co-presidents of the CIVIVA, a national organisation which makes arrangements for an extended period of alternative public service (""Service civil"" / ""Zivildienst"") to be performed by male citizens unwilling, for reasons of conscience, to undertake the normal terms of (otherwise compulsory) military service. Since May 2018 she has also served as president for the Swiss section of the Society for Threatened Peoples which emerged in 1970 from the Hamburg-based ""Aktion Biafra-Hilfe"" movement.

She was the first woman President of the Swiss Council of States.


== Early life ==
Meier was born in 1926 in Dagmersellen in the Canton of Lucerne. Her parents were Nicholas Meier, a hotel porter, and Josi Kumschick, a waitress and housewife.

== Political career ==
From 1959 to 1971, Meier was a member of the secondary school board in Lucerne and was a strong supporter of women's suffrage. In 1971—the same year that Switzerland granted women the right to vote—Meier was voted into Lucerne's cantonal parliament and subsequently, as a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland, became one of the first 11 women elected to the Swiss lower house, the National Council. During her term in the National Council, she chaired the Commission for Foreign Affairs and was a delegate to the Council of Europe. She was elected to Switzerland's senate, the Council of States, in 1983, and became its first female president (speaker) in 1991. She held the post of president until 1992. Meier left the Council of States and retired from Swiss politics in 1995.


== Death and legacy ==
Meier died in Lucerne on 4 November 2006, a decade after being diagnosed with cancer. She continued practicing law until her death. Her political achievements earned her the nicknames of the ""Grand Old Lady"" of Swiss politics and the ""old warhorse of Lucerne"". She was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Fribourg in 1991 and the University of Lucerne in 1994. As an advocate of women's participation in politics, she once declared that ""Frauen gehören ins Haus, ins Bundeshaus!"" (English: ""Women belong in the house ... in the House of Parliament!"").

In the second round, she was elected to be the 110th Federal Councillor with 125 votes, 115 votes going to Blocher and 6 spurious, empty or invalid. She accepted her election on 13 December 2007. She assumed Blocher's old portfolio as head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police.


=== Foundation of the Conservative Democratic Party ===
After her election, Widmer-Schlumpf was intensely opposed by the national leadership of the Swiss People's Party, who denounced her as a traitor to her party for accepting an election that she won without the support of the party. Immediately after her election, she was excluded from the SVP/UDC party group's meetings, as was her colleague Samuel Schmid. In another unprecedented development in Swiss politics, on 2 April 2008 the national party leadership called upon Widmer-Schlumpf to resign from the Federal Council at once and to leave the party. When Widmer-Schlumpf refused to do so, the SVP/UDC demanded that its Grisons section expel her. Since Swiss parties are legally federations of cantonal parties, the SVP/UDC could not directly expel her. The Grisons branch stood by Widmer-Schlumpf, prompting its expulsion from the national party on 1 June. In response, the former SVP Grisons section formed the Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland. The SVP's Bern section, of which Schmid is a member, also joined the new party.
Following a reshuffle of portfolios after the by-election of two new Federal Councillors in 2010, Widmer-Schlumpf replaced outgoing Hans-Rudolf Merz as the head of the Federal Department of Finance. Widmer-Schlumpf was elected Vice President of the Confederation for 2011, alongside President Micheline Calmy-Rey. On 14 December 2011 she was elected President of the Confederation for 2012—the fourth woman to hold the post after Ruth Dreifuss in 1999, Calmy-Rey in 2007 and 2011, and Doris Leuthard in 2010, as well as the third woman in a row. Due to a large amount of turnover on the Federal Council, she was the longest-serving member to have not yet served as its president. After the Swiss People's Party won a record vote of over 29% in the 2015 general election, Widmer-Schlumpf announced she would not run for reelection to the Federal Council on 28 October 2015. She was succeeded by Guy Parmelin.
