In 1999, she got a new job as the assistant of the Head of Mission EU-Programme at the Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. She ended her foreign career of nine years in 2002, when she started working for a secondment agency. She was on assignment as a secretary at Commit Arbo BV, an arbodienst, for one year. She founded a secretarial services company called ""SECONDIE"" as its sole trader the following year.


== IJsselstein politics ==
She became a member of the municipal council of IJsselstein besides her job in May 2006, after her party had received one of the 23 seats during the elections. In 2007 and 2008, she also served as director and joint owner of the secretarial services company Co-Support BV.Van Beukering was re-elected as the D66's lijsttrekker with 1,334 votes during the March 2010 municipal elections. Her party received three seats in total. She became Alderwoman of Society in IJsselstein in April 2010, when D66 became part of the new executive board. Her portfolio included the project multifunctional sport facilities. Because of her new position, she stopped her activities at her company and vacated her seat in the council. During the 2014 elections, she was again the lijsttrekker of her party, which received a plurality in the council of five seats. She returned to the executive board as Alderwoman of People, a position with a portfolio highly similar to her previous one, with as special project ""the customer at the center and deregulation"".She stepped down on 8 February 2017 simultaneously with her colleague Vincent van den Berg (CDA) because it was revealed that a cooperation between the municipalities IJsselstein and Montfoort had cost €1.5 million more the year before than planned. This resulted in the fall of the executive board. Van Beukering's departure was planned thirty days later. Both municipalities had started to merge their civil services in 2014 in order to decrease spending on their bureaucracies, but problems had emerged resulting in a need for an estimated €1.7 million to resolve them. A motion of no confidence in the municipal council earlier had failed. During the formation of a new executive board, the coalition fell as well, as D66 wanted resigned alderpersons to return, while this was unacceptable to the VVD. D66, being the largest party in IJsselstein, formed a new coalition just over two weeks after the fall of the board. Van Beukering returned as Alderwoman of Economic Affairs.Van Beukering appeared on place 24 on the party list of D66 during the 2017 Dutch general election. She received 4,971 preferential votes, and her party won nineteen seats – not enough for Van Beukering to be elected to the House of Representatives.On 21 September 2017 she resigned from her position as alderwoman again together with two others. A report had come out the month before that criticized the information the executive board had given to the municipal council about the cooperation with Montfoort. This had resulted in the CDA leaving the coalition. Van Beukering resigned after a number of parties with a majority in the council threatened with a motion of no confidence. In turn, the three resigning alderpersons declared that the council had become ""sour"" and was making it impossible for the executive board to govern. D66 subsequently passed the opportunity to form a new executive board to the second biggest party. Van Beukering was D66's lijstduwer in IJsselstein in the 2018 and 2022 municipal elections.


== Post-alderwomanship ==
After her terms as alderwoman, she worked as an independent advisor. As such, she has served as a project manager at the Netherlands Red Cross (2018), a member of the supervisory board of social work provider Amfors Groep (2019–2020), a clean air coordinator for the region IJmond employed by the municipality Velsen (2019–2020), and a program manager at Breed Spectrum Aanbieders for child protection in Eemland (2019–2020).


== House of Representatives ==
On 22 January 2020 Van Beukering became a temporary member of the House of Representatives, replacing Rens Raemakers who was on sick leave due to an occupational burnout. She was the next person in line for a seat of D66 because of her place on the party list during the 2017 general election. Within the D66 caucus, she became the spokesperson in the areas of child protection, juvenile crime, child abuse, the Participation Act, poverty and debt policy, and caregivers. She became part of the parliamentary Committees for Finances; Social Affairs and Employment; and Health, Welfare and Sport.Raemakers returned to the House on 13 May 2020, ending Van Beukering-Huijbregt's membership of the body. However, a week later, D66 MP Monica den Boer left the House to take a job as professor. Van Beukering succeeded her and thus became a permanent member of the lower house. Her portfolio changed slightly: it now included security, but excluded juvenile issues. She was member of the Committees for Justice and Security and for Social Affairs and Employment.She was the 25th candidate on the D66's party list in the 2021 Dutch general election but lost her bid for re-election. Her party received 24 seats, and Van Beukering personally received 2,215 votes. However, MP Sidney Smeets resigned a few weeks after his installation, and Van Beukering filled the vacancy. She was installed on April 21. Her focus was on the labor market, self-employment, AOW, pensions, income policy, leaves of absence, benefits, occupational disabilities, the intersection of labor and health care, and labor conditions, and she was on the Committees for Health, Welfare and Sport, for Kingdom Relations, for Public Expenditure, and for Social Affairs and Employment. Van Beukering worked on a bill in early 2022 to increase the say participants have in how money is invested by their pension fund after the Council of State had advised on an earlier draft by D66. She took over that body's proposal to change the original bill's right of approval for participatants to a right of advise. She said that the bill could lead to more socially responsible investing.


== Mayor of Nieuwegein ==
After the Mayor of Nieuwegein – Frans Backhuijs – announced he would not seek a third term, Van Beukering was selected as his successor by the municipal council in April 2023. Van Beukering left the House of Representatives on 1 June, and she was sworn in as Nieuwegein's first female mayor four days later.


== Other positions ==
Besides her work as a politician, she served as the chair of the National Association First-Aid between May 2014 and June 2022. She did a training to become a first-aid instructor at the Dutch Organization Teachers First-Aid in Tilburg in 2005. Before being appointed chairwoman, she worked at the organization as its secretary (2004–2011) and subsequently as an advisor to the executive committee. She has written a first-aid manual together with Nico Schouten called EHBO Leren & Doen (""First aid learning & practicing""), that was published in 2012. A revised edition came out in 2016. Besides, she was member of the supervisory board of the ""Prins Hendrik Fonds"", an organization that distributes first aid subsidies, from 2017 until 2020.


== Personal life ==
Van Beukering is married to Sander van Beukering and has two daughters. She is a resident of IJsselstein, a town where she has lived since her return to the Netherlands from Sarajevo. She plays tennis and has been the chair of the tennis club IJTC Groenvliet since November 2017.

20,"Yvonne Bijenhof-Dubbink (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈivɔnə ˈbɛiənɦɔf]; born 2 August 1966) is a Dutch politician of the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Raised in the Overijssel city of Almelo, she was a high school teacher and later became a manager for the ROC van Twente educational institution. She worked on several initiatives to promote technical skills as well as the regional labor market.
Bijenhof became politically active in the run-up to 2018 municipal elections, and she received a seat in the Almelo Municipal Council. She was re-elected four years later and became the parliamentary leader in of the VVD, which held a plurality in the council. Bijenhof also ran in the 2021 general election, leading in September 2023 to her appointment to the House of Representatives as the successor of Folkert Idsinga.


== Early life and educational career ==
Bijenhof was born as Yvonne Dubbink on 2 August 1966 in the Sint-Elisabeth Hospital in Almelo, Overijssel and grew up in that city. She started her career as a teacher at the Reggesteyn high school, with locations in Nijverdal and Rijssen, and she has taught Dutch language and literature.
In 2010, Bijenhof began working for ROC van Twente, a regional vocational education center, as a team coordinator. She later became a manager and strategic advisor responsible for the connection between education and the job market. As part of her role, she helped establish Twente Board – a collaboration between educational institutions, the government, and entrepreneurs to promote the regional economy – in 2014, and she served as its administrative secretary. She was involved in its Twente Werkt (Twente works) program to reduce unemployment. At ROC van Twente, Bijenhof was one of the founders of the Triple T High Tech Academy program in 2021, intended to keep those with technical skills in the region to combat a labor shortage. The education center cooperated with several companies as well as with the Heracles Almelo football club. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bijenhof was involved in a website to match students and companies for internships, as lockdown closures had reduced opportunities. ROC van Twente would subsequently assist these companies in applying for a government subsidy. Next to her job, Bijenhof was on the supervisory board of PCO Noord Twente, a network of Christian elementary schools in Almelo and Wierden, between 2013 and 2022, serving as its chair for the last five of those years. Bijenhof temporarily stepped down from her role at ROC van Twente in 2023 while a member of parliament.


== Politics ==


=== Almelo Municipal Council ===
Bijenhof joined the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), stating she agreed with its values of liberty, responsibility, and reciprocity. She ran for the municipal council in her home town of Almelo in March 2018 municipal elections as her party's fourth candidate. She intended to strengthen Almelo's social-economic structure by providing opportunities to those unable to participate in the economy. The VVD jumped from three to six seats out of the total 35, becoming the second-largest party in the council. Bijenhof was sworn in on 29 March 2018, and she was chosen as a member of the body's presidium. The VVD became part of the governing coalition along with the CDA, Christian Union, and the local LAS party. Bijenhof focused on spatial planning, social affairs, economy, governance, and external affairs in the council. From 2019 until 2020, she was on the board of the eastern Netherlands chapter of the VVD – consisting of Gelderland and Overijssel – as secretary.She sought a second term in the municipal council in March 2022 elections and was re-elected as number two on the VVD's list. The party itself lost one of its six seats, but it did receive a plurality of the vote. Bijenhof became the VVD's parliamentary leader, since the party's lead candidate – Arjen Maathuis – was serving on the municipal executive. She represented her party in negotiations to form a new governing coalition. A coalition agreement between the VVD, LAS, the CDA, and D66 was presented on 17 June 2022, and it included plans to build 3,400 homes and to assign healthcare social workers to neighborhoods. The latter was in response to several people who had been killed in Almelo in preceding years. When the municipal executive had decided in late 2022 to give priority to permanent residents in assigning public housing, coalition parties VVD and LAS voted in favor of a motion by the PVV that attempted to prevent the action. The motion was defeated 16–18, while Bijenhof questioned the executive's trustworthiness because of a 2020 promise against such a priority. She remained on the council when she entered the House of Representatives.


=== House of Representatives ===
Bijenhof ran for the House of Representatives in the March 2021 general election, being placed 48th on the VVD's party list. She pledged to represent the Twente region nationally, aiming to improve its accessibility by road and rail, and she received an endorsement from all fourteen VVD chapters in the region. She also wanted to promote vocational education, calling it the backbone of society. The VVD could claim 34 seats, gaining one, and was again the largest party in the House. Bijenhof was not elected, and 78% of her nearly 3,400 preference votes were from Overijssel. She became a board member of the VVD's directors association in June 2022. When Folkert Idsinga announced his resignation as member of parliament on 5 September 2023 – to switch to New Social Contract shortly after – Bijenhof was appointed to succeed him due to her position on the VVD's party list in 2021. She was installed on 12 September, and she became the party's spokesperson for lifelong learning and adult education. She serves solely on the Committee for Kingdom Relations. The collapse of the fourth Rutte cabinet two months before Bijenhof's swearing in had triggered a snap election for November 2023. Bijenhof participated again, as the VVD's 39th candidate.


== Personal life ==
Bijenhof is married to Nico, and they have a daughter and a son. As of 2021, she lived in the Almelo neighborhood of De Hofkamp.

She resigned after she was appointed as State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Fourth Balkenende cabinet, serving from 22 February 2007 until 14 October 2010. After the election of 2010, Bijleveld returned to the House of Representatives serving from 17 June 2010 until 1 January 2011 when she resigned after she was appointed as King's Commissioner of Overijssel. Following the election of 2017 Bijleveld was asked to become Minister of Defence in the Third Rutte cabinet. Bijleveld accepted and resigned as King's Commissioner of Overijssel the same day she took office as the new Minister of Defence on 26 October 2017.


== Early life and education ==
Bijleveld was born in the Dutch province of Overijssel. Between 1980 and 1986, she studied public administration at the University of Twente.


== Political career ==
In 1986 Bijleveld became a member of the Enschede municipal council for the Christian Democratic Appeal. She served as a Member of the House of Representatives from 16 November 1989 until 16 January 2001. She was Mayor of Hof van Twente from 1 January 2001 until 22 February 2007, when she resigned to become the State secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Fourth Balkenende cabinet until 14 October 2010. On 17 June 2010 she again became a member of the House of Representatives. She was an MP till 1 January 2011 when she became King's Commissioner of Overijssel.


=== Minister of Defence, 2017–2021 ===
Bijleveld left that position in 2017 as she was appointed to be Minister of Defence.
Early in her tenure, Bijleveld oversaw Dutch efforts to disrupt a 2018 attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).In October 2019, journalists from NRC and NOS revealed that an air raid on the Iraqi city Hawija in early June 2015 had been carried out by Dutch F16s. This bombing of a weapons depot resulted in 70 civilian deaths. Bijleveld's predecessor, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, was aware of this, but had incorrectly informed the House of Representatives about this. Bijleveld was criticized, because she too could have informed the House of Representatives about this earlier. For this reason  GroenLinks-parliamentarian Isabelle Diks filed a motion of no confidence on 5 November 2019, which was supported by 71 parliamentarians. In this parliamentary debate Rutte and Bijleveld stated that the number of seventy civilian deaths was uncertain and that this was also not known to the United States Central Command. After inquiries from NRC and NOS, United States Central Command however confirmed that they have known this number of casualties for a while now. The fact that journalists could get this information led to a fourth debate about this bombing. In this debate, Bijleveld survived another vote of no confidence, which was supported by only 69 parliamentarians.Bijleveld resigned on 17 September 2021 after the House of Representatives filed a motion of disapproval on how she and Sigrid Kaag handled the evacuation of Afghanistan, even though the day before she said she wouldn't resign.

22,"Philomena Bijlhout (born 13 November 1957) is a Surinamese-born Dutch former politician and television presenter.
She served as an MP in the Member of the House of Representatives as a member of the Pim Fortuyn List and was briefly State Secretary for Social Affairs, Employment and Equality in the First Balkenende cabinet. Her tenure was notable for being the first female foreign-born and ethnic minority politician to hold the post and the shortest in Dutch political history.
Bijlhout has since worked as a broadcaster.


== Biography ==
Bijlhout worked in television broadcasting in Suriname and later in the Netherlands. She was editor-in-chief and a presenter for RTV Rijnmond.
As a close associate of nationalist politician Pim Fortuyn, in 2002 she was recruited as a candidate for the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party. She was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for the Pim Fortuyn List from 23 May 2002 until 22 July 2002, when she became State Secretary for Social Affairs and Work Opportunity in the first Balkenende cabinet. Bijlhout was the first female ethnic minority politician in the Netherlands to hold the position.However, she resigned a few hours after being appointed, after television channel RTL 4 reported that she had been a member of a militia operated by Surinamese military dictator Dési Bouterse from 1982 and 1983. This was during the period when the militia had committed the political murders known as the ""December murders"". Bijlhout, who was born in Suriname, had never denied being part of the militia, but claimed she had left prior to the December murders. She claimed in an interview in de Volkskrant that there were no photographs of her in uniform in the militia and that she had left by 1981, but RTL 4 produced a photograph dated 1983 which appeared to show Bijlhout was still an active member. This subsequently triggered her resignation. Her tenure as a state secretary was the shortest in Dutch history. She was succeeded by Khee Liang Phoa. Bijlhout claimed that when she stood down from the position of State Secretary, LPF leader Mat Herben had said she was welcome to remain in the House for the party; however, Bijlhout decided to stand down as an MP too, due to the intense media response to the controversy.
After retiring from Dutch politics, Bijlhout hosted a travel show in 2004 and worked as a reporter for the Surinamese newspaper De Ware Tijd. She later became a social worker in Rotterdam. In 2008, she published an autobiography More than a Day.

Following her studies, she worked at the Europa Institute of Utrecht University, focussing on economic law.

She served as the University Medical Center Utrecht hospital administrator from 1976 until 1985. Borst was selected as Vice Chairwoman of the Health Council, serving from 1 January 1986 until 22 August 1994. Borst also served as a professor of medical ethics at the University of Amsterdam from 1 July 1992 until 22 August 1994. After the election of 1994 Borst was appointed as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport in the Cabinet Kok I, taking office on 3 August 1998. After the Leader of the Democrats 66 Hans van Mierlo announced he was stepping down five months before the election of 1998, he endorsed Borst as his successor. After Van Mierlo stood down on 15 February 1998, Borst was chosen to succeed him and became the Leader of the Democrats 66 and the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the Democrats 66 for the election of 1998. The Democrats 66 suffered a small big loss, losing 10 seats and now had 14 seats in the House of Representatives. Borst was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives and became the Parliamentary leader of the Democrats 66 in the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998. Borst stepped down as Leader of the Democrats 66 and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives in favor of Thom de Graaf on 30 May 1998. The following cabinet formation resulted in a continuing coalition agreement between the Labour Party (PvdA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to form a Cabinet Kok II with Borst continuing as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport and also becoming Deputy Prime Minister, taking office on 3 August 1998. In 2001 Borst announced her retirement from national politics and that she would not stand for the election of 2002.
Following her retirement Borst occupied numerous seats as a nonprofit director for supervisory boards for non-governmental organizations (Dutch Cancer Society, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Helen Dowling Institute, Institute for Health Services Research, National Committee for 4 and 5 May and the Brain Foundation) and as an advocate for cancer research. Borst continued to comment on political affairs as a stateswoman until her death on 8 February 2014 when she was murdered by a mentally unstable man in her home.


== Early life and education ==
Borst attended the Barlaeus Gymnasium of Amsterdam graduating in 1950. The same school was attended by People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) leader Frits Bolkestein, who was one class below her. Between 1950 and 1958, she followed a medical education at the University of Amsterdam where she obtained her medical degree in 1958. Subsequently, Borst worked as a resident physician at the hospital Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis in Amsterdam where she specialized in pediatric medicine and immunohaematology. In 1965 Borst started writing her doctoral thesis, while working as a medical scientist at Utrecht University, researching immunohaematology. In 1972, she received her Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Amsterdam following research on the development and prevention of rhesus immunisation.


== Career ==
In 1969, she was the head of the Bloodbank of the University Hospital of Utrecht, and in 1976, she became medical director of that hospital. In 1986, she left this position to become vice-chair of the Health Council, which she combined from 1992 with a position as professor in ""evaluating medical actions"" at the University of Amsterdam. In the Health Council, she chaired the committees on immunisation, genetics and medical ethics. Borst held several other positions in the medical world: she was chairperson of the College for Blood Transfusion as well as of the Committee on Research in Medical Ethics.
In 1968, she joined the Democrats 66, and was active as a rank-and-file member. In 1976, for instance, when the Democrats 66  had lost nearly all its members and performed particularly bad in the polls, Borst was a volunteer in the promotion and revitalization campaign of the party, led by Jan Terlouw.


=== Political career ===
In 1994, Borst became minister of Health for the Democrats 66  in the First cabinet of Wim Kok. As a minister, Borst was known for two things, for introducing progressive legislation in medical ethics and for her attempts to reform the medical system to better cope with the aging population.
In 2001, she implemented a law legalizing Euthanasia in the Netherlands under certain extraordinary conditions, and only when extensive protocols had been followed by the physician, and subject to an obligation of full reporting to a governing body. The law (Dutch: de Wet Toetsing levensbeëindiging en hulp bij zelfdoding, law on the legal review of euthanasia and assisted suicide) is considered her most important contribution in politics.Other progressive decisions she is responsible for include:

In 1994, she strengthened the rights of patients, giving them the right to information and privacy, and the explicit right to refuse treatment.
In 1996, she implemented the law on organ donation. As a result of the law, all Dutch citizens are asked when whether they wanted to become organ donor when they are 18 years old.
In 2001, the law on foetal tissue was passed, which legalized the scientific use of foetal tissue for medical research applications, if the parents agreed and if the foetal tissue was the result of an abortion or miscarriage.
In 2002, she prevented xenotransplantation.
In 2002, she gave permission to the Women on Waves group to offer pregnant women the abortion pill on board their boat, Aurora.
She also defended the Dutch system of soft drugs.She faced political problems preparing the Dutch medical system for the aging of the population. An important part of her reforms of the medical system was to integrate the health insurance system (which had a public and private part), achieving that all citizens would pay the same amount for the same coverage.  Although her ministry's budget was drastically increased during this period, she still had to limit the budgets of the hospitals. This led to a problem of long waiting lists for simple medical procedures. From both the political left and the political right she was criticized for what was seen as her mismanagement of the medical system.In the 1998 elections, Borst succeeded Hans van Mierlo as Lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the Democrats 66. She was parachuted by the party's leadership in a press-conference where Van Mierlo announced her candidacy with the words: ""It's a girl, and we call her Els."" Words which were similar to those that parents use to announce the birth of their new born child. Although Borst lost the elections – her party lost ten of its twenty-four seats – she remained the minister of Health, and became deputy-prime-minister. During the formation talks Borst served as Parliamentary leader of the Democrats 66 in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands from 19 May 1998 until 30 May 1998 and was the Informateur for the Democrats 66.
After the parliamentary inquiry in the El Al Flight 1862 (Bijlmer Plane Crash), Borst faced a motion of no confidence in June 1999. The inquiry committee had concluded that Borst and her ministry of Health did not react well to the health problems of survivors of the disaster. The motion was rejected by parliament after an eighteen-hour-long debate.
After a 2001 interview in the NRC Handelsblad, Borst also faced another motion of no-confidence. In the interview she had said ""It has been done"" (Dutch: ""Het is volbracht"") on completing the law on euthanasia. Which according to the Bible are the last words of Jesus, on the cross. The orthodox Protestant parties ChristianUnion (ChristenUnie or CU) and Reformed Political Party (SGP), who had opposed euthanasia were insulted by this. Although the motion was not carried by parliament, Borst made her apologies for those words to parliament.
During her ministry, she became a member of the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C., and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh.


== Later life ==
Before the 2002 elections, she retired from political life. On 8 February 2003 she became honorary member of the Democrats 66. Borst held many positions in public life, serving as member of the Remembrance of the Dead and Liberation Day Committees. She also held many positions in the medical world: she was chairperson of the board of NIVEL (National Institute for Scientific Research in Medicine), chairperson of the Federation of Dutch Cancer Patients Organizations and chair of the advisory board of the Brain Foundation of the Netherlands.


== Death ==
Borst was found dead on the evening of 10 February 2014 in the garage at her home in Bilthoven by two close friends. The eighty-one-year-old former politician was reported to be in good health after recovering from breast cancer a few years before. Dutch police concluded that Borst died on 8 February, just hours after attending a party congress of the Democrats 66 in Amsterdam, where she was reported to be visibly active and upbeat and left the party congress on her own and walked to the Amsterdam Centraal railway station nearby.
On 1 September 2015 the Public Prosecution Service released a statement that Borst died from forty-one stab wounds to her head, neck and hands. On 26 January 2015 police announced that a man with a criminal record had been arrested based on a DNA match; this man was arrested two weeks earlier on suspicion of involvement in the murder of his sister. Early in 2016 he confessed to the murder of his sister (almost a year after the murder of Borst). He said he killed his sister because they had different opinions on abortion and euthanasia. In February 2016 he confessed to having killed Borst because divine inspiration told him to do so, holding her responsible for the Dutch policy on euthanasia. Later he stated he had no intention to kill Mrs Borst, but wanted to ask her the address of former prime minister Wim Kok. When she refused to give the address, he remembered Borst had been responsible for the policy on  euthanasia. On 13 April 2016 Van U. was convicted of the two murders and sentenced to TBS (Involuntary commitment) on the grounds of a diagnosis of chronic paranoid psychosis in the context of schizophrenia.
On 16 March 2017 the Court of Appeal of The Hague declared Van U. only partially unaccountable for the murders and sentenced him to eight years in prison and TBS.

30,"Kauthar Bouchallikht (born 16 May 1994) is a Dutch politician, climate activist and publicist. She served as a member of the House of Representatives between 2021 and 2023 on behalf of the green political party GroenLinks. Bouchallikht was the first member of parliament in Dutch parliamentary history to wear a hijab. She is also known for her activism in the climate movement.


== Early life and career ==
Bouchallikht was born in Amsterdam in 1994 in a family of Moroccan descent and was also raised in that city. Starting in 2011, while in high school, she served on the board of LAKS, a Dutch interest group for students, and in that position helped organize a 2011 pupil strike against a mandatory minimum number of school hours. Bouchallikht studied public management at Utrecht University, where she obtained her master's degree in 2016. She also wrote some articles for the newspaper Het Parool during this period.After completing her studies, she started working as a freelance publicist, speaker, and trainer, working for De Correspondent, online sustainability magazine OneWorld, and Nieuw Wij. She also became the chair of the foundation Groene Moslims (Green Muslims), which promotes sustainability, in January 2018. Furthermore, she served as vice-chair of the Forum for European Muslim Youth and Student Organisations (FEMYSO) until December 2020. In this position, she provided training at a camp of a Millî Görüş youth organization.In March 2019, she assisted in an Amsterdam climate change protest. The organization for which she was a campaigner, DeGoedeZaak, was one of the organizers. A book by Bouchallikht and investigative journalist Zoë Papaikonomou called De inclusiemarathon (The inclusiveness marathon) about diversity and equality in the workplace was published in October 2021. For their book, they interviewed 41 diversity professionals. It was named Management Book of the Year in 2022.


== Politics ==


=== 2021 general election ===
In November 2020, Bouchallikht appeared in ninth place on GroenLinks's draft party list for the 2021 general election. She had not held any positions within the party before. Shortly after, author and former journalist Carel Brendel wrote on his personal blog about Bouchallikht's position at FEMYSO, which was not mentioned in her GroenLinks profile. Brendel cited allegations by Italian-American Islamist expert Lorenzo G. Vidino of ties between FEMYSO and the transnational Sunni Islamist organization Muslim Brotherhood, although the organization itself has denied this. Bouchallikht called it an allegation, denied having connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, and later denounced their ideas. Party leader Jesse Klaver defended her, calling her the figurehead of the green movement, but he also called it a bad idea to give training at Millî Görüş.In December 2020, blog GeenStijl published a picture showing Bouchallikht at a 2014 demonstration against violence in the Gaza Strip. She was surrounded by protesters carrying antisemitic slogans. Bouchallikht reacted by saying that she denounces antisemitism and that she should have left the demonstration when those banners were shown. The blog also found out that two years earlier she had liked a Facebook post, in which Jesse Klaver was called ""a villain or cowardly"" for not agreeing with a statement of political party NIDA equating Israel and the Islamic State. Arab news channel Al Jazeera published an opinion piece on their website by British activist Malia Bouattia, in which she called the media reports about Bouchallikht's candidacy ""racist, Islamophobic attacks"". It was signed by 102 persons and organizations including numerous politicians and academics. A data leak at a public relations firm later revealed that the government of the United Arab Emirates had hired them to wage a smear campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood that included the exaggeration of claimed ties between it and FEMYSO as well as payments to Vidino.


=== House of Representatives ===
In the election, GroenLinks won eight seats. Bouchallikht was elected to the House despite her ninth position on the party list due to the 27,038 preference votes she received. She was one of three members of the new House who were elected due to meeting the preference-vote threshold. Bouchallikht was sworn in on 31 March 2021 and became the first member wearing a hijab in the history of the House of Representatives. A small group of Pegida supporters protested against her installation. Her specializations in the House were MBO, digitization, environment, circular economy, kingdom affairs, infrastructure, and water management. In early 2023, she presented a plan with the Labour Party to make public transport more affordable. They proposed an experiment to provide free public transport to lower-income individuals as well as a reversal of recent price hikes in tickets. The €400 million required for the latter would be funded through an increase in the wealth and corporate taxes. Bouchallikht said that part of the population is dependent on public transport and that it should therefore be a basic right as opposed to a way to make a profit.When the collapse of the fourth Rutte cabinet led to a November 2023 general election, Bouchallikht was selected as the 17th candidate on the shared list of GroenLinks–PvdA. However, she announced her withdrawal from the list on 14 October due to her disappointment about the party's messaging surrounding the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. She was missing more emphasis on the background of the conflict and the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that triggered it, in particular previous occupational acts by Israel. Bouchallikht did appear on the ballot, as the deadline for filing names had passed, and she received 12,879 votes. She decided to decline her seat, and her term ended on 5 December.

== Early life and career ==
Bruyning was born in Almere on 26 January 1988. At age seven, she was removed from her home by child protective services, and she was subsequently raised by her grandmother. She has told that at a young age she wanted to become judge in a juvenile court to prevent trauma caused by out-of-home placements. She was bullied in school for her apparent lack of parents. Child protective services again intervened in Bruyning's teenage years when she had a run-in with the law, and she was placed in a youth detention center in Den Helder for her safety. She was transferred to another institution in Zeist at age 17 to start her transition back into society, and she completed her VMBO secondary education. Bruyning's father died by suicide in that period.She returned to her grandmother afterwards, and she gave birth to her first son in 2009. Another son was born four years later. Bruyning studied law at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences from 2010 until 2017. As a result of her several side jobs, the Tax and Customs Administration became convinced she had received too much in childcare benefits, and she was forced to pay back significant amounts leading to financial hardship for Bruyning. It was later revealed that tens of thousands of recipients of childcare benefits had been wrongfully accused of being fraudsters. This led to the resignation of the third Rutte cabinet in 2021.The year after her graduation from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Bruyning started working for the Municipality of Amsterdam as a fines specialist. She left that job in 2022 and was co-founder of Number 90, a meeting place in Almere for parents impacted by the childcare benefits scandal. She also started advising the Municipality of Almere on the recovery for its victims as part of a newly founded council. Following the completion of a transition study at the Open University, Bruyning obtained her master's degree in law at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in June 2023.


== Politics ==
In the years prior to her election, Bruyning regularly visited debates in the House of Representatives about the childcare benefits scandal, and she met MP Pieter Omtzigt (CDA), who was involved in its uncovering. When Omtzigt founded his own party called New Social Contract (NSC) in the run-up to the November 2023 general election, Bruyning joined it and was placed 18th on its party list for the election. NSC won 20 seats and Bruyning was sworn in as member of the House of Representatives on 6 December 2023.

A member of the Labour Party (PvdA), she served as Minister of Education, Culture and Science from 5 November 2012 to 26 October 2017 in the Second Rutte cabinet. She has been a professor of Science, Policy, Social Impact and Healthcare at Leiden University since 1 July 2018.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Mariëtte Bussemaker was born on 15 January 1961 in Capelle aan den IJssel in the province of South Holland as the daughter of Henk Bussemaker (1928–2018) and Elly Verduyn den Boer (1932–2017). Bussemaker attended primary and secondary education at the Rijnlands Lyceum in Oegstgeest. She subsequently studied at the University of Amsterdam, where she obtained a Bachelor of Social Science and a Master of Social Science cum laude in political science (specializing in Political philosophy). In 1993, Bussemaker received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in political and social-cultural sciences at the same university. Between 1993 and 1998 she was assistant professor of political science at the University of Amsterdam. She had been a member of the GreenLeft (GL) party during that period, but in 1995 she left it to join the Labour Party (PvdA) in 1997.


== Political career ==
In the 1998 elections Bussemaker was elected into the House of Representatives. She specialized in employment policy, health care and taxes. In 2000 she was co-initiator of a proposal to allow conscientious objection for working on Sundays. This proposal became law in 2002. She remained assistant professor during her membership of the House of Representatives, now at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.After the election of 2006, Bussemaker was asked to become State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sport in the Cabinet Balkenende IV. Bussemaker accepted and resigned as assistant professor the same day she took office as the new State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sport on 22 February 2007. In May 2008, Bussemaker received strong criticism from MPs and fellow cabinet members after stating for the radio that she supported 2008 American Presidential candidate Barack Obama, and that she would consider the election of his Republican competitor John McCain to be a disaster. She did this in defiance of a ban on Cabinet members discussing foreign politics in a personal capacity, instituted earlier after Bussemaker's fellow Dutch Labour party member and Finance Minister Wouter Bos expressed a similar sympathy for Barack Obama. On 20 February 2010 the Cabinet Balkenende IV fell and Bussemaker and the rest of the Labour Party cabinet members resigned on 23 February 2010.
In January 2011 it was announced that Bussemaker would be part of the Board of the ""Hogeschool Amsterdam"" (that includes the International Business School and the Johan Cruyff University) and the University of Amsterdam,  (they share the same board), she would also be dean at the Hogeschool Amsterdam. In December 2011 Jet Bussemaker and the board received heavy criticism for apparently allowing or not being able to curb widespread diploma fraud at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.Bussemaker gave the 2013 Mosse Lecture, titled Grenzen aan homo-emancipatiebeleid: burgerwacht of politieagent? – Over de 'red lines' van het homo-emancipatiebeleid (Limits to gay emancipation policy: civilian or police officer? - About the 'red lines' of the gay emancipation policy).

49,"Inge van Dijk (born 6 May 1975) is a Dutch politician, serving as a member of the House of Representatives since the 2021 general election. She represents the political party Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).
Before becoming an MP, Van Dijk had been a member of the Gemert-Bakel municipal council between 2001 and 2018, being her party's lijsttrekker in two elections. She became an alderwoman in 2018 and has also chaired CDA Brabant between 2015 and 2020.


== Early life and education ==
Van Dijk was born in the North Brabant city Helmond in 1975, and she moved at age one to the nearby village Bakel. Her father worked as a gas fitter. She attended the Helmond high school Dr. Knippenbergcollege and studied business administration at HAS University of Applied Sciences in 's-Hertogenbosch in the years 1994–99.


== Career ==
She took a job at Rabobank as internal account manager business relations in 1999 and would continue working for that company until she became an alderwoman in 2018. She served at several branches and at the national office in several positions including product manager. While working for Rabobank, she was a member of the Gemert-Bakel municipal council and volunteered at a number of local organizations including handball club Acritas, where she was a trainer, coach, and board member until 2014.Van Dijk joined the municipal council in 2001, a few years after the municipalities Gemert and Bakel had merged. She has told that she and her father had campaigned against the reorganization and that she had decided to become politically active because of that experience. She became the CDA's lijsttrekker during the 2014 Gemert-Bakel municipal election, having been eighth on the party list in the previous election. She succeeded Harrie Verkampen, who had been leading the party in Gemert-Bakel for several decades. Her party managed to bring an end to a period of four years without having a plurality in the council. In November 2015, Van Dijk also became the chair of CDA Brabant.She was again her party's lijsttrekker during the 2018 municipal election. Her party again received a plurality of votes, and Van Dijk vacated her council seat in May to become a full-time alderwoman responsible for economic and sport policy. Because of this position, she quit her job at Rabobank. In July 2019, Van Dijk survived a motion of no confidence. Her coalition was against plans to build a new swimming pool due to the financial risk involved and instead wanted to renovate an existing one. Under her leadership as chair of CDA Brabant, the party formed a coalition with, among other parties, the populist Forum for Democracy in 2020. A majority of CDA Brabant members (56%) had supported the coalition, that was controversial due to ideological disagreements, in a referendum. The previous coalition had collapsed because the CDA had left it. In May 2020, one of the four alderwomen of Gemert-Bakel left, and Van Dijk's portfolio changed; she also became responsible for finances and real estate and surrendered sport policy.


=== House of Representatives (2021–present) ===
Van Dijk ran for member of parliament during the 2021 general election, being placed fourth on the CDA's party list. In November 2020 – shortly after her position had been announced – she stepped down as CDA Brabant chair. She was elected, receiving 16,851 preference votes, and was sworn into office on 31 March. Van Dijk was the CDA's spokesperson for economic affairs, the interior, finances, and sports, and she is on the Committees for Digital Affairs, Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Finance, the Interior, Kingdom Relations, and Public Expenditure as well as on the Procedure Committee. In the House, she proposed to provide €10 million per year in funding from the national government for local political parties next to the already existing €27 million in funding for national parties. She also wanted to spend part of a fund from the European Union on providing free Internet for people with a low income. In 2023, Van Dijk complained the government was treating sports clubs and other associations too much like commercial businesses, threatening their existence, and she stressed their importance for society. She suggested several measures to aid the organizations such as exempting them from sales tax, increasing the compensation for volunteers, and having the government pay the first year of membership for new inhabitants.Van Dijk was her party's lijstduwer in Gemert-Bakel in the 2022 municipal elections.


== Personal life ==
Van Dijk has been living in the North Brabant village of Gemert since 2020, where she lives with her partner and three stepchildren. Before that, she resided in Bakel.Her former home in Bakel became the subject of municipal politics in 2019, because the zoning regulations only allowed the building and the neighboring building to be used as homes accompanying farms. She had tried to change those regulations at the Council of State, but a nearby farmer filed an objection fearing stricter environmental regulations. The municipal council eventually changed the zoning regulations such that both houses could be used as homes without farms.

55,"Wilhelmina Ruurdina Dille (2 June 1965 – 8 August 2018), commonly known as Willie Dille, was a Dutch politician.


== Career and politics ==
Dille achieved a bachelor's degree in youth work and worked for 25 years with disabled people in healthcare. On 11 March 2010 she was elected on behalf of the far right Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid) as in the city council of The Hague - one of the few cities where the party participated in the elections.
On 17 June 2010, Dille was elected as member of parliament in the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer) and she resigned from the city council. As a member of parliament, she was part of the coalition supporting the First Rutte cabinet. During her tenure, she focused on matters of services for the disabled, youth, adoption and casualties of war. In the September 2012 parliamentary elections, she was too low on the list to be re-elected. In May 2012, she returned as a member of the city council of The Hague, where she would remain a member until her death - after being re-elected in 2018, when Henk Bres initially received more votes than the higher placed Dille.In February 2016, Dille shared a video on Facebook that suggested Islam was a bad influence and that the world would a be better place if Islam ceased to exist, resulting in criticism from other politicians, accusing her of hate propaganda.In February 2018, the municipality of The Hague started an investigation into Dille's residence, as council members are obligated to live in the respective municipality. The investigation ended without definitive conclusion, but the mayor announced that new checks would be executed.


== Allegations of abduction and rape ==
On 6 August 2018, Dille published a video on Facebook where she announced her departure from the city council and showed desperation, blaming the mayor (Pauline Krikke) for starting the investigation into her residence, and city council member Arnoud van Doorn (former Party for Freedom, and now representing an Islamic party), whom she blamed for triggering the investigation. She didn't feel that she and her family were safe. She also accused him of organizing a group of Muslims to abduct, rape and abuse her, in order to shut her up. Van Doorn did not want to respond at the time, but considered filing legal charges.The following day, a local TV station interviewed Dille, where she claimed that the video was an emotional impulse, and that she deleted the video because of her family. She confirmed the content of the video (but did not want to go into details), did repeat her accusations towards the mayor and indicated that she was repeatedly threatened by 'Moroccans'. Journalists were unable to verify her claims from either the video or the interview.


=== Suicide ===
On 8 August 2018, Dille died by suicide after apologizing to her loved ones on Facebook. She was 53, married and had four children, 1 adopted child, and provided a second home for approximately 12 disabled children .After her death, the police and mayor said they had been in touch with Dille about the accusations, but never filed charges since she did not provide any further information on which an investigation could have been initiated.

Van Gent worked as the North Netherlands-coordinator of the FNV labour union between 1994 and 1998, when she was elected to the House of Representatives.
Van Gent focuses on two major themes: solidarity, including housing, social policy, employment, regional and economic policy, and durability, including agriculture, nature and animal rights. Van Gent has voted against the GreenLeft parliamentary party on several important issues: she voted against the marriage of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange and Máxima Zorreguieta, because she is a republican and she spoke out against GreenLeft's support for the invasion of Afghanistan. Van Gent initiated several legislative programs, concerning legal protection for whistle blowers, housing subsidies for students and constitutional protection of animal welfare. She has criticized lavish parties for departing politicians by saying ""you can knock a zero off the price tag for most of them."" She was opposed to a reduction in benefits to Turkish and Moroccan parents. She has criticized poor railway performance; she said ""They are ‘ready for winter’, except when it snows.""

69,"Lisa Mianti van Ginneken (pronounced [ˈlisaː van ˈɣɪnəkə(n)]; born 28 June 1972) is a Dutch politician of the social liberal party Democrats 66 (D66). She worked as a software developer and later gave organizational trainings. She started serving as chair of the organization Transvisie in 2017 and became a member of parliament after the 2021 general election. Van Ginneken is the first transgender person to be elected into the Dutch House of Representatives, where she is her party's spokesperson for IT, privacy, family law, and mobility.


== Early life and career ==
Van Ginneken was born and raised in Oosterhout, North Brabant with her two older sisters, and her father was an electrician. She attended its secondary school Mgr. Frencken College at havo level for seven years. While a teenager, she developed games for the Commodore 64 to earn some extra money. Between 1991 and 1995, she studied business informatics at the West-Brabant University of Applied Sciences. Van Ginneken started her career as a software developer at TAS Groep and became a manager and consultant at Inter Access Cens in 1997. She subsequently worked for Verdonck Klooster & Associates as a senior consultant in the years 2000–2006. Van Ginneken founded her own business, Grip op ICT, in the latter year, working as a consultant, coach, and trainer. She owned another company, cnxy, where she served as an organizational change manager, coach, and trainer starting in 2014.In October 2017, Van Ginneken became chair of Transvisie, an advocacy group that represents the interests of transgender persons in the Netherlands, beside her job. She had served there as a coordinator since 2016 and had also been a board member for about half a year. Van Ginneken also became a member of the advisory board of the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights in October 2019.


== Politics ==
In the 2021 Dutch general election, she was elected into the House of Representatives. She was the 22nd candidate on D66's party list and received 10,969 preference votes. Van Ginneken had decided to run for office because of comments by Thierry Baudet, the leader of the conservative and populist party Forum for Democracy, during the campaign for the 2019 provincial elections. She campaigned on giving transgender and intersex people more say in their medical procedures and on limiting the power of technology corporations.Van Ginneken was sworn into the House on 31 March 2021 as the first transgender member in its history. She simultaneously left Transvisie and the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights. Van Ginneken was D66's spokesperson for ICT, digital government, intelligence agencies, privacy, family law, identity, roads, mobility, railways, and public transport. She is a member of the Committees for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; for Digital Affairs; for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy; for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation; for Infrastructure and Water Management; for the Interior; and for Justice and Security as well as of the Benelux Parliament and the Building Advice Committee, which advises on the renovation of the Binnenhof. In an interview, she argued for investing more in the European technology industry, calling the continent's technological dependency on the United States and China a threat to privacy protection. She filed an amendment to the Transgender Act in late 2021, which would make it possible for non-binary persons to have an ""X"" in their government ID as their gender designation without the intervention of a judge. The Council of State advised negatively on the amendment for legal reasons, and Van Ginneken subsequently drafted a bill instead. She also defended a revised Transgender Act that was proposed by the fourth Rutte cabinet and that would remove the requirement for a statement by a psychologist or psychiatrist to change one's legal gender. Van Ginneken said that the barrier leaves the impression that transgender people are not able to make this decision by themselves and that its removal would aid in self-development. She discarded worries about men changing their gender to enter women's changing rooms, noting that passports are not checked at the door.She received the 2021 Pride Award in the category Well-known LGBTI+ Hero. The chair of the jury, Cornald Maas, called the fact that she is the House's first female transgender member ""important and historic"". Van Ginneken announced in November 2022 that she would leave social media platform Twitter, as healthy debate was being undermined by hateful comments according to her.


== Personal life ==
Van Ginneken is divorced and has a son. She moved to Amsterdam shortly after her divorce and has lived there since. Van Ginneken has also resided in Breda and Zoetermeer. She is transgender, and her transition to a woman started in 2014. She underwent sex reassignment surgery in Thailand in June 2016.Van Ginneken is an actress and stage manager in amateur theater.

75,"Nilüfer Gündoğan (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈnilyfɛr ˈɡʏndoːɦɑn]; born 6 June 1977) is a Dutch politician, who was a member of the House of Representatives. She was elected to the House in the 2021 general election on behalf of Volt Netherlands. In February 2022, she was suspended from its parliamentary group following internal reports of unacceptable behavior. Gündoğan had before worked as a consultant and manager.


== Early life and career ==
Gündoğan was born on 6 June 1977 in Nazımiye, Tunceli Province, Turkey, into an Alevi family, belonging to the Zazas. She has a brother and a sister. Her father had been a teacher in Turkey and had moved to the Netherlands as a guest worker to work in a factory. When Gündoğan was 18 months old and when her father had been in the Netherlands for five years, her family moved to the Netherlands, and she grew up in the Limburg city Weert. There, she attended the secondary school Philips van Horne at vwo level.She moved in 1996 to Amsterdam to study medicine, but she quit in 2003 without a degree. According to Gündoğan, this was caused by her violent father. She has told that she was hospitalized in September 2001 after her father had attempted to kill her and that she subsequently fell into a depression. In the years 2005–07, she studied political science at Leiden University, but she again did not graduate. Gündoğan worked simultaneously project assistant for the municipality of Amsterdam. She held the position of strategic renewal project manager at the municipality between 2009 and 2012. Gündoğan later worked as a consultant, account manager, and interim manager at several other organizations including Rainman Group and jb Lorenz. When she was elected to the House, she also owned her own consultancy called Nilüfer Advies.


== Political career ==
Gündoğan identifies as a social liberal and joined the political party Democrats 66 (D66) in 2009. She participated in its development program Route66 for two years and served on the board of Amsterdam's D66 wing between late 2011 and 2013. Gündoğan wanted to become D66's lijsttrekker in Amsterdam-Zuid for the 2014 elections but lost to Sebastiaan Capel.Over the years, she became disappointed with some aspects of D66, and she joined Volt in 2018, the year its Dutch branch was founded. Gündoğan stands for a liberal democracy and society and has warned against tampering with liberal democratic principles in the Netherlands. She has been vocal in her support for the European Union to tackle cross-border issues, including the migrant crisis, climate change, digital security, and liberal democracy. Gündoğan was the second candidate of Volt Netherlands in the 2019 European Parliament elections. The party received 1.93% of the vote, not enough to meet the threshold for a seat in the European Parliament.


=== House of Representatives ===
In the 2021 Dutch general election, Gündoğan was again placed second on Volt's party list. She had been a candidate to be the party's lijsttrekker, but this position had gone to Laurens Dassen instead in June 2020. Gündoğan received 41,352 preference votes in the election and her party won three seats. She was installed into the House of Representatives on 31 March. She is on the Procedure Committee and on the Committees for Defence; for Education, Culture and Science; for Finance; and for Public Expenditure. In June 2021, Gündoğan filed a motion to prohibit tobacco lobbying, but it came seven votes short of passing the House. Another proposal of her was a new tax on profit made from the sale of a house, similar to an existing one in France, in order to address rising housing prices by combatting speculation.She wrote a letter to Speaker Vera Bergkamp with Sjoerd Sjoerdsma (D66), in which they called for a discussion with the House's presidium to address threatening comments made by House members of Forum for Democracy (FVD) during debates. One of the incidents they referred to occurred in 2021 when Gündoğan had complained about intimidating emails by DENK and FVD supporters. House member Gideon van Meijeren had subsequently said that he was very proud that his supporters were going all out to change her mind about the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gündoğan continued to speak out against extreme language and threats on social media, and she filed a police report following death threats. She mostly blamed right-wing populist politicians, calling Geert Wilders a ""nasty racist"" on Twitter. She apologized for a tweet in which she said she would inject Thierry Baudet everyday if there would have been a vaccine against fascism. After Gideon van Meijeren declared in a July 2022 speech that farmers could sometimes be justified in using violence during the period of farmers' protests, Gündoğan announced that she would file a criminal complaint for sedition and inciting violence.


=== Expulsion from Volt ===
A number of internal complaints about unacceptable behavior by Gündoğan led Volt to suspend her from their parliamentary group on 13 February 2022 awaiting the results of an external investigation. The episode occurred during a wave of allegations of inappropriate behavior against high-profile people in the Netherlands. Gündoğan said that she was unaware of the nature of the complaints. In a statement two days later, she called her suspension disproportionate, and she declared that she would keep her House seat regardless of the outcome of the investigation. She also said that she would be sorry if her working style had made anyone feel unsafe. Her lawyers announced on 18 February that Gündoğan would take legal action against Volt's parliamentary group in order to end her suspension, to get a rectification, and to receive damages. The party stated, in turn, that she was unwilling to cooperate with the external investigation, which Gündoğan had described as not independent. Volt decided to permanently expel Gündoğan from its parliamentary group on 26 February as a result of 13 allegations from fellow party members of physical violence, unwanted sexual advances, intimidation, and abuse of her position. That same day, Gündoğan filed a criminal complaint for defamation against Volt's board, party leader Laurens Dassen, and the accusers. A judge determined on 9 March that the expulsion had been unjust, as procedures had not been followed correctly and as there had been no proper justification, and ordered its immediate reversal as well as €5,000 in damages. Dassen also apologized to Gündoğan in reaction. The proceedings made clear that three complaints concerned sexual advances and another three concerned slaps on the butt, while the others were related to verbal assault and excessive alcohol usage. Gündoğan denied having crossed any boundaries with her behavior.Newspaper NRC Handelsblad published an article on 13 March outlining several instances of Gündoğan's alleged unacceptable behavior after having spoken with five of the accusers. It included anger outbursts, drunken behavior, and asking for sex as well as a slap on the butt of a female minor, which was described by the victim as intimidation. Gündoğan dismissed the allegations, calling them a smear campaign and calling their level painfully low. Days after the article's publication, Dassen and Volt's board made clear that reconciliation could only be achieved if Gündoğan would withdraw her criminal complaints. She instead told on talk show Jinek that she had expanded them. Volt subsequently announced that it would appeal the judge's decision, and Gündoğan was again expelled from the party's parliamentary group on 22 March following a vote among its three members after the by-laws had been altered to allow for this. Furthermore, Volt's board decided to end her membership of the party on 28 March. Gündoğan returned to the House of Representatives on 10 May as the leader of her own parliamentary group – Lid Gündoğan (Member Gündoğan) – after nearly three months of absence, bringing the number of groups in the House to a record-breaking twenty. She told that the focus of her work would be on finances, democracy, and the rule of law. The Public Prosecution Service dismissed Gündoğan's criminal complaints for defamation a few months later. An Amsterdam appellate court reversed the lower court's earlier decision on 7 February 2023, ruling that Volt had been justified in expelling Gündoğan from their parliamentary group. However, it did conclude that Volt's original press release about Gündoğan's alleged unacceptable behavior had been a little premature and sometimes formulated in an unfortunate way. Volt published a report of its own about the affair in May, but it did not draw any conclusions or provide concrete examples of unacceptable behavior.


=== 2023 general election ===
The fall of the fourth Rutte cabinet in July 2023 triggered a November snap election. Gündoğan announced she would not run for re-election, saying she did not have enough time to establish a new party.


== Personal life ==
Gündoğan has been living in Amsterdam since 1996. She was married to Bas Vogels, whom she knew from D66. Bas was diagnosed with incurable colorectal cancer months after their relationship had started in January 2014. They married in 2015 in France, and Nilüfer subsequently bore the last name Vogels. Bas was voluntarily euthanized in March 2017, about half a year after the birth of their son Mikail. Gündoğan raises her son as a single parent. She is an atheist.

76,"Natalia Liane den Haan (born 24 August 1967) is a Dutch politician and former nonprofit director, who has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2021.
She was the managing director of LGBT rights organization COC Nederland from 2001 to 2004 and subsequently filled that same position at senior advocacy group ANBO. Den Haan left the latter organization after she had been chosen in October 2020 to lead the pensioners' party 50PLUS in the 2021 general election. She succeeded Henk Krol and was elected to the House of Representatives. Following an internal conflict within 50PLUS, she left the party in May 2021 while keeping her seat. Den Haan founded her own party, GOUD Netherlands, the following year.
Den Haan has also held a seat in the Social and Economic Council (SER) and in the Woerden municipal council for four years as a member of Democrats 66 and the Labour Party.


== Early life and career ==
Den Haan was born on 24 August 1967 in Woerden in the province Utrecht. Her father worked as manager of a mortar factory, while her mother was a hairdresser. Den Haan attended the secondary schools Kalsbeek College and Minkema College, located in the same town, at mavo and havo level. She subsequently studied nursery at a university of applied sciences and worked as a hospital nurse. Den Haan's father died when she was 18 years old.At the start of the 1990s, after having studied business administration at The Hague University of Applied Sciences for four years, she took a job as operations coordinator at a catering and party service company. Den Haan left that company in 1993 and thereafter worked in recruitment and organization consultancy. She was an operations coordinator and later operations and product group manager at Van der Kruijs RPD Groep until 1998. She then worked for two years as a senior consultant at Verstrate Business Development Support before becoming CEO of The Office Managers in 2000.


=== COC Nederland (2001–2004) ===
Den Haan became the managing director of COC Nederland, an LGBT rights organization, in 2001. In an interview, she told that she had chosen for the federation because she wanted to work at a more idealistic place.Den Haan managed to put the COC's finances and membership records in order, but the organization's problems returned while she was on maternity leave. Because of this, she advocated management reforms. Subsequently, the board of directors suspended her in spring 2004 and started a dismissal procedure, arguing that her leadership had resulted in a budget deficit and that she had pitted employees of COC against the board. A local judge determined that the suspension was unjust, as no proof was found to support the accusations. During an emergency general meeting in July, Den Haan was voted out by the COC's members, while the board resigned. She left her post on 1 November. The internal quarrel was one of the reasons for the establishment of the competing organization Homo LesBische Federatie Nederland.


=== ANBO (2005–2020) ===
In May 2005, Den Haan started working as managing director of ANBO, an organization with over 150,000 members advocating for the interests of the elderly. She managed to improve the financial situation of the association, which was €3 million in debt and was close to bankruptcy. ANBO became an affiliate of the trade union federation FNV in 2009 after the organizations had cooperated on multiple issues. The move was supported by Den Haan, who argued that it would give ANBO more tools to serve the interests of the elderly. It also resulted in Den Haan receiving a seat in the Social and Economic Council (SER).Under her leadership, ANBO moved powers from its chapters to its headquarters: its board was dissolved and Den Haan was given a new title (directeur-bestuurder) in July 2013. Simultaneously, a supervisory board and a members council, whose chair was chosen by Den Haan, were formed. Members of the management of the Overijssel division who had criticized those reforms were expelled. According to Den Haan, the reason was that they were unable to explain the division's finances, but a judge determined three removals were unjust. When the organizational structure of the FNV was reformed in 2013 after internal struggles, ANBO ended its membership. Den Haan stated that the largest subsidiaries would keep their disproportional influence and that she wanted subsidiaries to have more say in issues in their respective areas of specialty.In September 2015, ANBO's management blocked access to the bank accounts and member registries of its nearly 400 chapters after it said that at least €200,000 had been embezzled and that a letter had been sent calling to embezzle more. Volunteers were only able to use money with the approval of ANBO's headquarters. That led to the departure and expulsion of many volunteers in chapter managements, to the establishment of local alternative organizations, and to calls for Den Haan's resignation. Volunteers said their integrity had been publicly put into doubt and called it part of an effort to diminish the power of the chapters. The number of ANBO members decreased from 180,000 to 125,000 in the following months, causing the organization to lose its position as the largest Dutch interest group for seniors to the Catholic Unie KBO. In July 2016, ANBO's management disbanded all its chapters.The advocacy group joined the Trade Union Federation for Professionals (VCP) in 2017. Den Haan again became a member of the SER when the VCP received a second seat the following year, but left the advisory body in the first half of 2019. Den Haan quit as ANBO director at the end of December 2020 because of her position at 50PLUS.During her time at ANBO, she had also been active at Roze 50+ (Pink 50+), a cooperation between ANBO and COC Nederland supporting elderly LGBT people; Fundis, a network of health care providers; and Summa College, an Eindhoven mbo school with multiple locations. Den Haan joined the supervisory board of Fundis (then called Vierstroom) in December 2010 and became the board's chair in September 2011. She left Fundis at the end of November 2018. At Summa College, Den Haan chaired the supervisory board from 2018 until April 2021, and has been a regular member since.


== Politics ==


=== Woerden municipal council ===
Den Haan first appeared on the ballot during the March 2006 municipal election in the town Woerden. She was placed second on the party list of Democrats 66 (D66) and was elected to the municipal council. The following year, she switched to the Labour Party (PvdA), which cooperates in the Woerden municipal council with GroenLinks under the name Progressief Woerden. Den Haan was not re-elected in the 2010 elections, being placed seventh on the party list, but she remained a staffer assisting the group. She was on Progressief Woerden's party list once more in 2014, being their sixteenth candidate.


=== 50PLUS leader and election campaign ===
In July 2020, Den Haan was asked by 50PLUS chair Jan Nagel to apply for the position of lijsttrekker in the 2021 general election. She was not a member of the party. 50PLUS had been without a leader since Henk Krol had left the party in May to establish the Party for the Future. The party's leadership put Den Haan forward as their preferred lijsttrekker during a press conference in August after fourteen candidates had applied. During an online convention on 3 October, she won the member election with 52% of the 362 votes and thus officially became the party's lijsttrekker. Five other people ran for the position including members of parliament Corrie van Brenk, who received 42% of the vote, and Léonie Sazias. However, the latter dropped out and endorsed Den Haan to prevent Van Brenk from winning.Before her election, 50PLUS had opposed reforms of the pension system proposed by the cabinet, unions, and employers' associations, but Den Haan had supported them while she was ANBO director. After the election program was released, Den Haan called it a done deal and said that she wanted the party to be involved in working out the details of the reforms. Den Haan also wanted to widen the party's reach by taking care of future elderly people instead of solely defending the interests of the current elderly generation. The only incumbent on 50PLUS's party list for the 2021 general election was its lijstduwer. During the campaign, Den Haan explained that her party had abandoned its position that the retirement age should unconditionally return to 65 in order to finance an increase in the state pension. She said that, under her plan, people who want to retire at 65 as opposed to 67 should make an additional contribution to their state pension. After the party's third candidate, Ellen Verkoelen, had criticized those comments, Den Haan to no effect called on her to withdraw her candidacy if she disagreed.


=== House term ===
50PLUS lost two of its three seats in the 2021 general election, causing Den Haan to become the only member of her party to have a seat in the new House. She was sworn in on 31 March and is on every standing committee including as vice chair of the Committee for Education, Culture and Science. Den Haan announced on 6 May that she had decided to leave 50PLUS due to a falling-out with the party leadership and that she would continue as an independent politician. The conflict had started during the campaign, and the board had written a letter with numerous complaints about Den Haan's leadership to all 50PLUS members in late April. They accused her of not cooperating with the leadership and of following a progressive course without consultation. Den Haan had in turn reacted in an internal memo that she had been sabotaged, teased, and intimidated. Even though Den Haan left her party, she remained a parliamentary group as opposed to an independent House member and kept the same funding and speaking time during debates. This was because the speaker argued that it was impossible for someone to split off from a one-person group. To decrease her workload as an independent politician, Den Haan started cooperating with Sylvana Simons (BIJ1) and Caroline van der Plas (BBB), who also have a one-person group, while she mostly focussed on elderly policy and income development. However, she told that her idea to pool policy advisors was rejected.In August 2021, she met with the Minister of Tourism and Environment of the unrecognized state of Northern Cyprus while on holiday. This led to criticism from the Cypriot Minister of Finance. Den Haan defended herself, saying that she was visiting him informally in her capacity as a private citizen. Later that year, she offered her help to elderly care facilities following personnel shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After she had received several reactions, Den Haan began volunteering on weekends. She was a member of a committee tasked with the preparation of a parliamentary inquiry into the government's COVID-19 response and made herself available to participate in the inquiry. When it was indefinitely postponed in June 2022 as only four parties had nominated an MP to take part, Den Haan co-wrote an opinion piece in which she called it an unwise decision given that the pandemic had impacted all facets of society.She launched her own pensioners' party called GOUD Netherlands (GOLD, a contraction of 'good old') in September 2022. Den Haan said the party's positions would not deviate much from those of 50PLUS. However, she described GOUD as having a less populist style and being more leftist on issues such as climate and migration. The parliamentary group of 50PLUS in the Provincial Council of South Holland switched to the new party shortly after. When the fourth Rutte cabinet collapsed in July 2023 – triggering a snap election in November – Den Haan announced she would not seek a second term. She called the state of politics ugly, saying populism and opportunism were rampant and that she was suffering from misogyny.Den Haan joined the board of directors of Zonnehuisgroep Vlaardingen, a local long-term healthcare provider, in November 2023, where she serves alongside Arjan in 't Veld.

78,"Kiki Babette Hagen (pronounced [ˈkiki ˈɦaːɣə(n)]; born 6 January 1987) is a Dutch politician of the Democrats 66 (D66) and an elementary school teacher. She has been a member of the House of Representatives since the 2021 general election. She previously served as an alderwoman in the municipality De Ronde Venen. From 2011 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2018, she held a seat in the municipal council of that same municipality.


== Early life and teaching career ==
Hagen was born in Amsterdam and grew up in Vinkeveen, Utrecht. Her mother worked as a teacher, and her father owned a pub in the Amsterdam neighborhood of Jordaan. Hagen has a sister and attended the Mijdrecht secondary school Veenlanden College between 1999 and 2004 at havo level. She received her Bachelor of Education from the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences in 2010 and subsequently became a teacher at the Abcoude primary school OBS Piet Mondriaan. She also did a pre-master in public administration at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the years 2015–16. Hagen stopped teaching when she became an alderwoman in 2018.


== Local politics ==
In 2010, Hagen co-founded the local political party Lijst 8 (List 8) in De Ronde Venen and participated in the special municipal election that was held on 24 November in anticipation of the merger of the municipalities of De Ronde Venen and Abcoude on 1 January 2011. The party was founded to increase the representation of young people in the council and won two seats. Hagen, who was the party's lead candidate, was installed as a municipal councillor and as Lijst 8's caucus leader in January 2011.She vacated her seat in the council to join Democrats 66 in October 2013. She was re-elected in the 2014 municipal election, being the top candidate of D66 in De Ronde Venen. Hagen received another term in the 2018 municipal election, again being her party's lead candidate, but went on maternity leave on the day of her swearing in. She did not return to the council, as she became an alderwoman and third deputy mayor of De Ronde Venen in April 2018. Hagen's portfolio included sustainability, the environment, education, and youth affairs. Waste and sewage were added to that when an alderman resigned in 2019.In February 2021, local party Ronde Venen Belang asked questions about an €800 subsidy Hagen had received to make her house more sustainable. She subsequently paid back the money, and an investigation by the municipality later concluded that the subsidy had been wrongfully granted. A large majority of the council retained their trust in her.


== House of Representatives ==
Hagen was placed twenty-first on the candidate list of D66 for the 2021 general election. She was elected into the House of Representatives with 24,485 preferential votes – only three D66 candidates received more votes. Hagen was installed on 31 March and became D66's spokesperson for aviation, roads, mobility, the environment, and circular economy. She simultaneously left De Ronde Venen's municipal executive. In the House, Hagen is a member of the Committees for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy; for Education, Culture and Science; for Infrastructure and Water Management; and for the Interior (chair), and she is on the Benelux Interparliamentary Consultative Council and the Interparliamentary Committee on the Dutch Language Union. Her specialties later changed to mbo, green education, lifelong learning, the environment, and circular economy. Hagen led a parliamentary delegation which in the summer of 2022 visited Suriname, Curaçao, and Bonaire for nine days to investigate the history of Dutch slavery. It was organized one year ahead of a remembrance year that marked 150 years since the abolition of slavery in the Netherlands. Besides, the Dutch government apologized for its history of slavery not long after the trip. Hagen criticized mass consumption of clothing during Black Friday and called it a ""pitch-black day for our Earth"". Simultaneously, she proposed several measures to mitigate the effects of the clothing industry on the environment. These included investments in circular clothing brands, higher penalties for greenwashing, and the introduction of an ecolabel such that consumers can make more informed decisions.Hagen was chosen to serve as informateur in Amersfoort after D66 won a plurality there in the March 2022 municipal elections. A few weeks later, she advised a coalition consisting of D66, GroenLinks, the CDA, Amersfoort2014, and the Party for the Animals. The VVD had filed a motion of no confidence against Hagen during the process alleging false information, but it did not garner enough support in the council and the VVD later apologized for it. A coalition was eventually formed that included the Christian Union instead of Amersfoort2014 in July.


== Personal life ==
Hagen has a son, and she moved from Mijdrecht to The Hague while a member of parliament.

79,"Femke Halsema (pronounced [ˈfɛmkə ˈɦɑlsəmaː] ; born 25 April 1966) is a Dutch politician and filmmaker. On 27 June 2018, she was appointed Mayor of Amsterdam and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She is the first woman to hold the position on a non-interim basis. She previously was a member of the House of Representatives for the leftist green party GroenLinks from 1998 to 2011, and served as the party's parliamentary leader from 2002 to 2010.


== Career ==


=== Family background ===
Halsema was born in 1966 in Haarlem in a Dutch social democratic family. They moved to Enschede, a town in the east of the Netherlands, close to the German border (Twente). Her father W. Halsema was a sports teacher and director of the municipal service for physical education, sports and recreation (Dienst lichamelijke opvoeding, sport en recreatie) of Enschede. For a long time, from 1982 until 1994, her mother Olga Halsema-Fles was an alderwoman responsible for social affairs and employment for the Labour Party (PvdA) in Enschede. Her mother was also a member of the Dutch Social Insurance Advisory Board (College van Toezicht Sociale Verzekeringen).


=== Religious origin ===
Halsema and her mother are of Christian descent. Halsema's mother Olga Margaretha Bertha Fles was born in 1941 in Velsen-Driehuis near harbour town IJmuiden north of Amsterdam. Olga Fles' parents Cornelis Nicolaas Fles and Truus Corbee married in 1939 in the Noorsche Kerk, Nederlands Hervormd, a Dutch Protestant church in Hilligersberg, near Rotterdam. Olga lived with her husband Willem Halsema and son in Haarlem until 1966, where Femke was born. Then the family moved to Enschede and Olga became wethouder (alderwoman) of Enschede's municipal council.
In an interview with the Reformatorisch Dagblad (RD), a Dutch Protestant Christian Reformed newspaper, in 2002 Femke Halsema presumed members of her maternal family to have been ""assimilated Jews"", because two nephews of her maternal grandfather Cornelis Nicolaas Fles were named Abram and Izaak, whom she supposed had been tailors. Halsema referred to some families with the surname Fles in the region (Twente) Enschede being Jewish. But Halsema's own family is not related to them.
Olga Halsema-Fles’ family originates from Leiden, with a few ancestors residing in Rotterdam, amongst whom Abram and Izaak Fles, her uncles. Both Abram and Izaak Fles belonged to the Nederlands Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church). As such they were registered in the Rotterdam municipal archive. They worked as civil servants, married and died in 1961 in Rotterdam.Abram, Izaak and Jacob are common first names in Dutch Protestant churches, chosen from the Hebrew Bible, next to New Testament names. Abram and Izaak Fles belonged to the Nederlands Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church), just like their father Izaak, a brother to Halsema's great-grandfather Cornelis Fles, and their grandfather was. Halsema's family tree in the maternal line shows, that all ancestors in this family Fles since the start of the 18th century were baptised in Leiden, a historical stronghold of Protestantism in the Netherlands. Before, in the 17th century all ancestors were baptised in Roman Catholic churches as was their first known forefather Johannes Fles (Flessinghe), born ca. 1640 in Sarbrug (Saarbrücken, Germany), who settled in Leiden, in Holland.Dutch historian Bart Wallet included Femke Halsema in a chapter on contemporary Dutch Jewry in an entirely revised edition (2017) of “Geschiedenis van de joden in Nederland"" (""History of the Jews in the Netherlands""). But after some genealogical research in 2020 Wallet published an article in the Dutch Jewish internet magazine Jonet ""Waarom Femke Halsema toch niet joods is"" (""Why Femke Halsema is not Jewish after all""), admitting his mistake, indicating he will correct this in the next edition of this book. The article was reprinted in the Dutch Nieuw Israëlitisch Weekblad (New Israelitic Weekly).


=== Career before politics ===
In 1983, Halsema graduated from the Kottenpark-college in Enschede with a Havo-diploma. Between 1984 and 1985 she attended the Vrije Hogeschool (teachers program for Waldorf schools) in Driebergen. In 1985 she started training as a Dutch and history teacher in Utrecht. In 1988 she left her training without graduating. After that she worked for a year in a Utrecht café. She then started studying general social sciences at Utrecht University, specialising in criminology. During these studies she had a number of jobs related to her specialisation. Between 1991 and 1993, she was an intern at the working group ""police and immigrants"" at the Ministry of the Interior and she was a student assistant for professor Frank Bovenkerk. In 1992, she worked as an ""supernumerary lecturer in scientific methods and techniques"" at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Utrecht University, teaching statistics to first year students.
After Halsema graduated in 1993, she joined the staff of the Wiardi Beckman Stichting (WBS), the research institute of the Labour Party. She was seen as a rising talent in the Labour Party. In 1995, she published the book Ontspoord. Opstellen over criminaliteit & rechtshandhaving (""Derailed, essays about crime and law enforcement"") for the WBS. In 1996, she travelled through the United States as a fellow for the German Marshall Fund. In 1996 she became an editor for the De Helling, the magazine of the research institute of GroenLinks. In the same year, she started combining her work at the WBS with work for De Balie, a political and cultural centre in Amsterdam, where she met Kees Vendrik, who before that worked for the GroenLinks in the House of Representatives. For De Balie, she led the project Res Publica about the meaning of the Constitution of the Netherlands for the modern society. She also joined the programme committee of the Labour Party for the 1998 election. She also published the book Land in zicht: een cultuurpolitieke benadering van de Ruimtelijke Ordening (""Land ho, cultural-political essays about spatial planning"") with Maarten Hajer. She was asked to be a candidate for the Labour Party in the 1998 election.In the autumn of 1997, Halsema left the Labour Party and the WBS. The direct cause was the authoritarian way in which the police had handled the protests against the European summit that was working on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The social democratic mayor Schelto Patijn had put 500 people in preventive detention. Her dissatisfaction with the course of the Labour Party had grown. In her view the party was unable to renew its social democratic manifesto and use the rising economic tide to invest in the public sector. After leaving the WBS, she continued to work at De Balie and also was a columnist at Het Parool and for IKON radio. She also works as an editor at the publisher Van Gennep.


=== Political career ===


==== Member of the House of Representatives ====
In the 1998 election, she was a candidate on the list of GroenLinks after being courted by Paul Rosenmöller. She was the third candidate on the list, making her the highest new candidate and practically guaranteed her a seat in the House. The seventh was her former De Balie-colleague Vendrik. GroenLinks more than doubled its seat total from five to eleven. In her first period in the House, Halsema was spokesperson justice, asylum seekers and home affairs. She became well known due to her opposition to the tougher migration law proposed by Job Cohen.
In the 2002 election, she was given the second place on the list. The party lost one seat. Halsema became vice-chair of the parliamentary party and among others spoke for the party in the first debate with the First Balkenende cabinet. In November of that year Paul Rosenmöller unexpectedly announced that he would leave politics. He asked Halsema to succeed him, and she immediately agreed. Ten days before the party congress she was announced as the only candidate for the party leadership and became top candidate for the 2003 election. The party lost another two seats. In addition to the party leadership she was spokesperson on areas of culture and media, healthcare, spatial planning and the environment. As party leader she had a more prominent position and put forth a number of private member's bills, including one concerning judicial review and another that sets a fixed price for books (together with the leader of the Democrats 66 (D66) Boris Dittrich).

Between October 2003 and January 2004, Halsema was on maternity leave. She got twins. Marijke Vos, the vice-chair of the parliamentary party took over as party leader. After her return to the House of Representatives, Halsema started a debate about the course of the left in general and GroenLinks in particular. She claimed that her party was the last ""left liberal party in the Netherlands"". She called for increased cooperation with the Socialist Party, the Labour Party and GroenLinks, aiming at a left-wing majority government after the 2007 election. She asked Labour Party leader Wouter Bos to speak out in favour of such a cabinet, but he refused in order to allow for a possible coalition of the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal. In January 2006, she was elected ""Liberal of the Year"" by the Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy, the youth organisation of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), because of her new political course, in particular where it came to reforming the welfare state. In June 2006, she was the only candidate for the top spot on her party's list. During the campaign, she published Linkse lente (Left-wing Spring), a book co-authored by Michiel Zonneveld, which blends her political vision and personal biography. In the 2006 election the party lost another seat.
In 2007, she took over the private member's bill of Wijnand Duyvendak, who worked together with Niesco Dubbelboer of the Labour Party and Boris van der Ham of D66, to allow for a non-binding corrective referendum. In April 2010 the party congress voted against including the referendum in the party manifesto.
In the run-up to the 2010 elections, Halsema's political profile rose: she was given the Thorbecke prize for political eloquence. and she was elected by Intermediair as the best candidate for Prime Minister.During the 2010 election, GroenLinks went from seven to ten seats. The party, under Halsema, negotiated with the VVD, the Labour Party and D66 to reach agreement on a new ""Purple Plus""-government, but the negotiations failed.On 17 December 2010, Halsema announced that she would leave parliament and that Jolande Sap was elected as the new leader of GroenLinks. She formally left parliament in January 2011.
In 2016, she made public in her political memoire Pluche (Plush) that after the 2012 election she was asked to consider becoming minister of Development Cooperation by Lodewijk Asscher, the Labour Party leader, but the VVD vetoed this.


==== Mayor of Amsterdam ====
On 27 June 2018, she was appointed Mayor of Amsterdam and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She is the first woman to hold the position fully as Guusje ter Horst and Kajsa Ollongren held the position previously in an ad interim manner (for 14 days in 2001 and 21 days in 2017 respectively). Also, Halsema was a first GreenLeft member to become Amsterdam's mayor.
In the Netherlands, protests were also taking place on the Dam on 1 June 2020 for George Floyd. Halsema was criticised because of the crowd gathering and the 1.5 meter (5') safety issue from COVID-19, it was impossible to manage the 1.5 meter rule between the protesting citizens which was a must for safety reasons. Halsema was criticised on the Dutch news by a lot of people in the medical field for not taking action and lack of responsibility. In Den Haag and Rotterdam, there were also protests but where the 1,5 meter safety measurement had been followed and the second protest became too crowded and further protests where cancelled and stopped.On 1 July 2021, Halsema apologised for the city's involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.


=== Work outside of politics ===
After she left politics in January 2011, Halsema worked as freelancer: she has been active as an administrator, member of advisory committees, in science, as an author and television creator.
Immediately after her political career, Halsema joined De Volkskrant, for which she wrote number of articles and columns in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, she was involved in De Correspondent, for which she also wrote articles for two years. In 2016 she wrote her political memoir Pluche. In 2017 she wrote the Essay Nergensland. Nieuw Licht op migratie (""Nowhereland. A new light on migration""), where she proposed a utopian alternative to the international refugee question. In 2018 she wrote the essay Macht en Verbeelding (""Power and Imagination"").In 2011, she became professor by special appointment at Tilburg University occupying the Leonardo Chair for half a year. She taught at the Tilburg School of Humanities. In 2012 she became a temporary professor at University of Utrecht, occupying the Peace of Utrecht Chair. She researched the meaning of social media for human rights and democracy.In December 2012, she led an inquiry into the behaviour of administrators at the school board of Amarantis. She succeeded Martin van Rijn, who had become junior minister of Health. The committee Halsema found that the board had acted within the law but that their behaviour was not desirable. After that she led a committee on the governance code for the semi-public sector at the request of the Minister of Economic Affairs Henk Kamp The final report of the committee concluded that a governance code would not lead to the desired culture change in the semi-public sector. The committee focused its attention on the old boys network and political cooperation. In 2015 she was asked by employees and students at the University of Amsterdam to lead the committee concerning the financial policy of the University. After a month she returned the assignment. The committee felt that elementary conditions were not met for independent, careful research. Since January 2018, Halsema at the request of the Council of the Judiciary chair of the quadrennial review committee.Since 2011, Halsema has been President-Commissioner at WPG Uitgevers, which is among other responsible for the publisher De Bezige Bij, Vrij Nederland and Voetbal International.

Since 2015 she is a member of the board the Start Foundation, a fund for people who have ""distance to the labour market"". And since 2016 she has been a commissioner at Independer. 
Additionally, Halsema has been a member of the executive of a number of non-profits: between 2011 and 2017 she was chair of the board of Stichting Vluchteling. Since 2017, she has been chair of the board of Aidsfonds/Stopaidsnow. She chairs the board of Adelheid Roosen's theatre company and of IDFA.In 2014, Halsema made the six-part documentary series Seks en de Zonde (""Sex and Sin"") with Hassnae Bouazza about women in the Islamic world. She interviewed activists Veena Malik and Souad al-Shammary for this. Together with Gijs van de Westelaken, she developed and produced the TV-series De Fractie (""The Parliamentary Party"") about politics in The Hague. Recently she has been working with her partner Robert Oey on a documentary series on terrorism. In the Spring of 2017, she made a theatre tour with her theatre-lecture Een Vrij Land (""A Free Country"").


== Political views ==
Halsema sees herself as a left-liberal. In Dutch she prefers vrijzinnig (free-thinking) over liberaal (liberal) because the conservative liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy is seen as the pre-eminent liberal party. In 2004, she started a debate within her party about a new political course. Her new course emphasises two concepts: freedom and pragmatism.
With the concept freedom, Halsema seeks to connect herself with the ""freedom-loving traditions of the left"". Like Isaiah Berlin, Halsema discerns two traditions of freedom: negative and positive liberty. For Halsema negative liberty is the freedom of citizens from government interference. She wants to apply this concept especially to the multicultural society and rule of law, where she seeks to reduce the influence of government. Positive liberty is, according to Halsema, the emancipation of citizens from poverty. Halsema wants to apply this concept especially to the economy, the welfare state and the environment, where the government should take more action.
With pragmatism, Halsema has contrasted her politics with those of the new populist political right, such as Pim Fortuyn. While the right, in Halsema's eyes, had become dogmatic and tried to reform society on the basis of new principles, Halsema claimed that the left has got more feeling for the ""narrow margins of politics."" According to Halsema, the left has emphasised equitable outcomes, as opposed to merely fair-minded principles.
This new course has been integrated into several practical proposals on the economy, which together form Vrijheid Eerlijk Delen (""Sharing Liberty Fairly""). These proposals have led to considerable debate. Halsema proposes that the main goal of the welfare state should be the emancipation of citizens from poverty. To ensure this, she proposes a new model for the welfare state, which is modelled on the Danish welfare state. In her perception of the welfare state, the government should endeavour to ensure full employment by cutting taxes on labour, increasing labour flexibility and creating more government jobs. If there is more work, so this theory goes, everybody can get a job, after a maximum of one year of unemployment. She also called for the implementation of a partial basic income.


== Personal life ==
Halsema married the tv documentary maker Robert Oey. Oey made among others the film De Leugen (The Lie) in which Halsema participated amongst others by singing. On December 20, 2022 they announced that they had separated since a year. Their twin children are Bruno and Suzy. Halsema resides in an official residence on Herengracht while Oey kept the house in Holysloot.

Heijnen attended the Geleen secondary school Graaf Huyn College and started studying law at Maastricht University in 2000. She left two years later to study European studies at the same university and received her Master of Arts degree in European public affairs in 2006. Heijnen subsequently worked as a freelance lobbyist in Brussels for clients such as pension fund ABP. She took a job as tutor at Maastricht University in 2008 and became head of its Brussels campus the following year. The campus, which is situated in a single building and started out with a €250,000 annual budget, opened in 2010 and moved to a different location in April 2018, at a time when its budget had been doubled. She left her job upon her appointment as alderwoman two months later.


== Maastricht politics ==
Heijnen participated in the March 2010 municipal election in Maastricht, being placed fourth on the CDA's party list. She had decided to become politically involved as a result of her role as a lobbyist. Her party won seven seats in the council, but Heijnen was not elected as candidates lower on the list had cleared the preference vote threshold. She was appointed to the council on 6 April after two CDA councilors stepped down to become aldermen in the new municipal executive. In October 2010, the CDA's council group leader, Peter Geelen, resigned following the falling apart of the government coalition, which later resulted in the CDA becoming an opposition party in Maastricht for the first time since World War II. Heijnen was chosen to succeed him in late November, and she said that safety would be one of the party's priorities. The Maastricht CDA decided the following year to call for the closing of all coffeeshops in the city because of the nuisances they were causing. Heijnen was re-elected to the council in March 2014 as lead candidate, while her party lost two seats. She headed a confidential committee in 2015 to find a new mayor for Maastricht, which recommended Annemarie Penn-te Strake. Heijnen also tried without success to bring the headquarters of the European Medicines Agency from London to South Limburg, when it had to be relocated as a result of Brexit.She ran for member of parliament in the 2017 general election as the CDA's 26th candidate. She received 15,821 preference votes, 90% of which were cast in her home province of Limburg, but she was not elected due to her party winning nineteen seats. Locally, Heijnen was again her party's lead candidate in the March 2018 municipal elections. The CDA won a plurality in the council, and she kept her seat. She left the council on 18 June 2018 to become alderwoman and deputy mayor in the new municipal executive. Her responsibilities included the economy, the job market, regionalization, housing, well-being, permits, social innovation, and smart city. To increase citizen participation in local politics, Heijnen organized a forum, during which inhabitants could determine on which projects €300,000 of the municipal budget would be spent, following a similar idea in Antwerp. Its first round was held in 2021 after a number of postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the run up to a 2020 CDA leadership election, she endorsed Pieter Omtzigt, who would eventually lose. She stepped down as alderwoman when she was appointed Minister for the Environment in January 2022. She also withdrew herself as lead candidate in the 2022 municipal elections.


== Minister for the Environment ==
Heijnen became a member of the new fourth Rutte cabinet and was sworn in on 10 January 2022 at Noordeinde Palace by King Willem-Alexander. She serves as Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management, succeeding Steven van Weyenberg, but internationally she wears the title of Minister for the Environment. Her portfolio includes environment (excluding climate), soil, public transport, railways, international public transport, cycling policy, sustainable transport, the KNMI, the ANVS, and the PBL. The cabinet extended financial aid to public transport due to the COVID-19 pandemic from September to December 2022. Numerous local politicians warned that ending the aid afterwards would threaten a downgrade of the public transport network due to the sustained effects of the pandemic on ridership, and Heijnen subsequently offered another €150 million in conditional aid for 2023 – significantly less than the €500 million public transport providers had asked for. In March 2022, Heijnen announced a ban on disposable plastic cups and meal packaging in the office, on festivals, and in hotels and restaurants starting in 2024 in line with the European Union's Single-Use Plastics Directive to decrease waste. She later announced the rule would not be fully enforced following critical motions from the House of Representatives. She launched a three-year campaign in 2023 to increase bicycle usage for short distances after the cabinet had the year before appropriated €780 million to improve cycling infrastructure.When the concession for the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) to operate on the Dutch main rail network neared expiration, Heijnen proposed to renew the concession for the period 2025–33 without accepting bids from other railway operators. International connections – previously all operated by the NS – were offered to others. The concession extension was supported politically in the Netherlands as a result of opposition to further privatization of the railways. However, the European Commission warned a market analysis would have to be performed to consider alternative railway operators, and it started an infringement procedure alleging Heijnen intended to award the concession without a tender shortly before new EU competition regulations would mandate it. Heijnen negotiated the conditions of the new concession, in which the NS would trade its €200 million in yearly exploitation fees for €13 million in subsidies from the government. Heijnen also accepted the introduction of a rush hour charge to spread out passenger load. She promised the House of Representatives to revisit the latter following widespread criticism.The fourth Rutte cabinet collapsed on 7 July 2023 due to disagreements over asylum reforms and continued as a caretaker government.

82,"Conny Helder (born 27 November 1958) is a Dutch healthcare manager, who has been serving as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport as part of the fourth Rutte cabinet since 2024.
She was born in The Hague and trained to be a surgical assistant. She rose to managerial positions in hospitals and served as chair of the board of directors of an Eindhoven network of primary healthcare centers starting in 2010. Helder became director of tanteLouise, a major provider of elderly care in the Bergen op Zoom area, seven years later and was involved in a number of projects to renovate existing and construct new nursing homes. She also led a regional cooperation to promote innovations in the elderly care sector. tanteLouise was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reached the Netherlands in February 2020. Helder, who had become a board member of the trade association ActiZ the month before, made frequent media appearances to comment on the pandemic and to advocate the association's positions.
When the fourth Rutte cabinet was formed, Helder was asked to join as Minister for Long-term Care and Sport on behalf of the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). She was sworn in on 10 January 2022 and has proposed a plan to provide more elderly care at home rather than in nursing homes in reaction to the aging population of the Netherlands. She succeeded Ernst Kuipers as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport in January 2024 following his resignation.


== Early life and healthcare career ==
Helder was born on 27 November 1958 in The Hague. She attended the secondary school Jan Campert Mavo in that city in the years 1971–74 and subsequently did havo and vwo at Thorbecke Lyceum. Helder applied to study medicine but was rejected because of a quota, and she started studying chemistry at Leiden University in 1978 instead. She dropped out the next year to follow a training at Bronovo and Westeinde, two The Hague hospitals, to become a surgical assistant. She completed it three years later and started working. Between 1986 and 1988, Helder also followed executive training in healthcare at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. She did another part-time study at Leiden University during this period in political science but did not finish it. Helder started filling managerial positions in hospitals, initially in The Hague and Amsterdam. In 2000, she became manager at the University Medical Center Utrecht's (UMCU) surgical division. She switched to the surgical specialties division of the same hospital four years later.Helder left UMCU in July 2010 to become chair of the board of directors of the Eindhoven Corporation of Primary Health Care Centers (SGE). The organization operated ten centers in the city of Eindhoven with general practitioners, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and psychologists, among others. It was suffering from a €1.6 million operating deficit as well as a conflict between Helder's predecessor and healthcare professionals. Helder told upon her appointment that she wanted to expressly involve the latter group in important decisions. In 2015, under her leadership, SGE opened a new healthcare center in Strijp-S for expats living in Eindhoven after an evaluation had shown that many expats did not trust the Dutch healthcare system due to the relatively important role of general practitioners.


=== tanteLouise and COVID-19 pandemic ===
Helder started serving as director of tanteLouise, an elderly care provider active in Bergen op Zoom, Steenbergen, and Woensdrecht, in June 2017. Back then, the organization employed 1,800 people and took care of approximately 4,000 elderly people, including 1,100 in its approximately fifteen nursing homes. She wanted to improve the healthcare chain and to sign more longer-term agreements with health insurance companies and municipalities. The following year, one of its nursing homes in Steenbergen started experimenting with augmented reality glasses for medical diagnoses by remote specialists. Her tenure also saw the closing of some facilities, mostly older and smaller retirement homes, and the construction and renovation of others. To enable these changes, a temporary facility with close to 100 units was opened in 2019 on the grounds of mental institution Vrederust in Halsteren. Plans to tear down most of Huize St. Catharina in Bergen op Zoom in order to build a new facility faced some resistance due to the perceived historical value of the complex from 1929. However, the municipality decided against listing it as a heritage site, paving the way for its demolition. Helder became chair of the board of directors of the West-Brabant Care Innovation Center (CIC), a cooperation between local healthcare providers to promote innovations, in 2019. A few months before, a new nursing home of tanteLouise for dementia patients called Hof van Nassau had opened in Steenbergen, featuring several technological innovations such as GPS trackers to allow inhabitants to roam around more freely. It drew attention from the BBC, CCTV, and a delegation from Tsinghua University, and Helder joined Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport Hugo de Jonge on a working visit to China.In January 2020, Helder joined the board of ActiZ, a national trade association representing about 400 elderly care providers. The first case of the coronavirus in the Netherlands was detected on 27 February, marking the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Together with other leaders of healthcare organizations in North Brabant, Helder established the Regionaal Overleg Niet Acute Zorg (RONAZ; Regional consultation of non-acute care) the following month. The body advised nursing homes to close their doors to visitors in order to mitigate the spread of the virus to this vulnerable group; Helder complied and did not allow any visitors starting on 16 March. The third Rutte cabinet made the measure mandatory three days later. The complete ban remained in place until 19 May, while Helder had called it no longer sustainable and inhumane a month earlier. Despite precautions, several nursing homes of tanteLouise experienced outbreaks of the coronavirus including Het Nieuwe ABG, where the army assisted and where 29 out of 168 inhabitants died in late 2020. Vaccinations started in the Netherlands in early January 2021, initially only at dedicated centers. A few weeks later – after the creation of smaller vaccine batches had been made possible – vaccinations commenced at nursing homes and disability care centers, and tanteLouise was chosen to be among twelve organizations that received the vaccines first as part of a pilot. On 1 March 2021, Helder, who used to be tanteLouise's sole director, was joined on the board of directors by two others. The supervisory board stated that the move was necessitated by increasingly complex elderly care, innovations, and major real estate projects.Being a spokesperson for ActiZ and RONAZ, Helder often commented on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing homes in the media, leading Brabants Dagblad to describe her as the face of elderly care during the pandemic. She drew attention to shortages in nursing homes of personal protective equipment at the start of the first wave of infections and of personnel in later stages, when many employees were absent after having contracted the virus. Helder also voiced the opinion that elderly care was initially overlooked in comparison to intensive care. After vaccines had become widely available, she defended ActiZ's position that elderly care facilities should have insight into the vaccination status of their employees. She said it would enable organizations to have discussions with teams with a low rate. Helder was among three people shortlisted in September 2020 for the title Topvrouw van het Jaar (Female leader of the year).


== Fourth Rutte cabinet ==
Helder became Minister for Long-term Care and Sport in January 2022 as part of the new fourth Rutte cabinet on behalf of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). That party had won a plurality in the general election held in March 2021 and had formed a coalition with the centrist-progressive Democrats 66 (D66) party and the centrist-conservative Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and Christian Union (CU) parties. The cabinet was sworn in on 10 January by King Willem-Alexander at Noordeinde Palace. Helder is a minister without portfolio – meaning that she does not lead a ministry of her own – and her responsibilities are long-term care (elderly and disabled care), mental healthcare, district nursing care, personal health budget, quality policy, labor market policy, sport, coordination of accountability of the health ministry's COVID-19 policy, lawful care and good management, decreasing bureaucracy, and organizability/regionalization. She set herself the goal of ""keeping healthcare qualitatively good while also keeping it affordable, accessible, and attractive"".


=== Healthcare policy ===
Helder called the required growth in healthcare personnel due to an aging population unsustainable; the Scientific Council for Government Policy (WRR) had concluded that a quarter of the labor force would have to work in the healthcare and welfare sectors in 2040, up from one-sixth in 2021. Helder said that healthcare therefore had to be organized differently. She presented a plan in July 2022 called Wonen, Ondersteuning en Zorg voor Ouderen (WOZO; Living, support, and care for the elderly) to reform elderly care in the Netherlands by having the elderly live at home for a longer time as opposed to moving to a nursing home. Helder planned to achieve this goal through health care prevention, additional housing for the elderly, and technological innovations such as videotelephony and robots. The cabinet set aside €770 million for this purpose for the next five years. Helder accordingly abandoned the government's plans to add 50,000 nursing home spots by 2031 in favor of raising the capacity of total nursing care by the same number. She also launched a new program to spend €500 million per year to retain healthcare workers by increasing job satisfaction through innovation, education, development, and increased participation in decisions. The latter program was criticized by the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV) for not including plans for higher wages.With her appointment as minister, Helder took over an investigation into a €100 million sale of imported face masks to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by TV pundit and activist Sywert van Lienden and two accomplices. They claimed the deal was not-for-profit at a time when there was a shortage of personal protective equipment, but it was later discovered that it had earned them €20 million. When newspaper de Volkskrant reported in March 2022 that former health minister Hugo de Jonge had insisted that officials reach out to Van Lienden despite having earlier denied any involvement, a majority of the House of Representatives asked Helder for a statement of facts. She did not comply, citing the fact that the delayed investigation was still ongoing. Helder did release a number of documents related to De Jonge's involvement including a letter of his ahead of a debate. She admitted that De Jonge had asked for the release, and she apologized following criticism from opposition parties that she only informed the House at his request after initially refusing to do so. Helder decided to take legal action against Van Lienden's company in October 2023.


=== Sports ===
During the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the cabinet decided to send Helder to attend a match between the Netherlands and host country Qatar. The House of Representatives had earlier carried a motion not to send a government delegation due to the country's human rights record. Following calls to wear an armband of the anti-discrimination campaign OneLove, Helder was criticized for showing up with a much smaller pin instead. She also wore a scarf that read ""Never mind"", but she later mentioned this had been unintentional. In March 2023, Helder announced the government would establish an independent integrity center for abuse, doping, and match fixing in sports and that the Center for Safe Sports Netherlands (CVSN) would be transferred from NOC*NSF to the new body to increase its independence. The move followed a wave of allegations of inappropriate behavior in the sports world.


=== Demissionary cabinet ===
The fourth Rutte cabinet collapsed on 7 July 2023 due to disagreements over asylum reforms and continued as a demissionary cabinet. The House of Representatives subsequently declared the topic of budget cuts for elderly care controversial, meaning the cabinet can no longer make decisions on it. However, a €460-million planned spending reduction for 2024 had already been worked out by the ministry. The government finally announced that it would scrap half of the cut as part of its budget. Helder became acting Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport when Ernst Kuipers stepped down on 10 January 2024 to pursue an unspecified job. Her new position became permanent when Pia Dijkstra was sworn in on 2 February as Minister for Medical Care, a ministership without portfolio.


== Personal life ==
Helder has been living in 's-Hertogenbosch since the 1990s, and her partner is a general practitioner from that city. They have a son and a daughter, who were born around 2000.

84,"Eva Leonie ""Eveline"" Herfkens (Dutch pronunciation: [eːvaː leːjoːni eːvəlinə ˈɦɛr(ə)fkə(n)s]; born 9 January 1952) is a retired Dutch politician and diplomat of the Labour Party (PvdA) and activist.


== Private life and education ==
Eva Leonie Herfkens was born on 9 January 1952 in The Hague in the Netherlands.
She went to public primary schools in Venezuela and The Hague. She went to a public secondary school in The Hague, where she followed the gymnasium program in sciences. She studied Dutch law at Leiden University in Leiden from 1969 to 1975. Her sister Annette Herfkens was the sole survivor of Vietnam Airlines Flight 474.


== Career ==
From 1976 to 1981, she worked as a policy officer in the field of development cooperation at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Herfkens subsequently became a member of the House of Commons of the Dutch Parliament from 1981 to 1990.  She served as committee member and treasurer of Parliamentarians for Global Action from 1985 to 1996; from 1986 to 1989, she was a member of the Economic Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and joint organizer of the north–south campaign.
Herfkens also served on the Council of the Labour Party (PvdA), and has been chair of the Evert Vermeer Foundation, chair of the Dutch Fair Trade Organization, and a member of the Development Committee of the Netherlands Council of Churches.
From 1990 to 1996, Herfkens represented the Netherlands and a number of other countries at the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank Group in Washington, D.C. In 1993, she became co-Dean and in 1995, Dean of the Board, a leadership position that involved coordination of board member views and representation of the Board vis-a-vis the Bank's president and management. From 1996 to 1998, Herfkens served as Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Netherlands, in Geneva, Switzerland, a position whose responsibilities involved the representation of the Netherlands in all of the international organizations headquartered in Geneva. In this capacity she served in a number of leadership positions, such as vice-chair of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board and Chair of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Subcommittee on Least Development Countries. The latter provided the setting for one of her lasting accomplishments: the establishment of the Integrated Framework for Trade Related Assistance, a coordinating mechanism for trade related assistance to poor countries that, to this day, continues to be the focus of international efforts.
In 1998, she became the Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation, a job she held until 2002. In this capacity, she radically changed Dutch Development Cooperation priorities. One of her lasting accomplishments was the focusing of Dutch assistance to poorer developing countries that have made real commitments to poverty reduction programs and policies. She widened the influence of Dutch assistance policies by helping establish in 1999 the Utstein Group consisting of the Ministers for Development Cooperation of Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway and the Netherlands. The four Utstein countries agreed to collaborate in their approach towards poverty reduction worldwide, by streamlining their own aid delivery systems and by influencing the international community's policies to combat poverty. Her work as Minister and member of the Utstein Grouphas received wide international acclaim, including, in 2003, through the award of the first annual Commitment to Development Award by the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C. The OECD acknowledged that the ""Utstein Group"" of which she was a member contributed to international development receiving attention beyond the ""development community"" and making the MDG's the dominant framework for discussing development. Her contributions and those of the ""Utstein Group"" are extensively discussed in a recently published volume.On 1 October 2002, Eveline Herfkens was appointed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as his Executive Coordinator for the Millennium Campaign, with the rank of an Assistant Secretary General, for a period of 4 years, later prolonged with an additional year by a decision of the UNDP Executive Office. She continued to be involved in the Campaign as its Founder and Special Advisor to the UNDP Director on a volunteer basis until 2009. In this capacity, Herfkens helped promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through advocacy activities at the global level and in particular in Europe. At present, she is a visiting scholar at the Paul H. Nitze School of Adnaced International Studies of Johns Hopkins Universityin Washington DC and a Senior Fellow at the School's Center for Transatlantic Relations.
In her personal capacity, Herkens has served and/or is serving as of member of:

The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization;
The UN Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa;
The ILO/WHO Social Protection Floor Advisory Group;
The Governing Board of the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (Geneva,  Switzerland);
The Governing Board of the African Centre for Economic Transformation (Accra, Ghana);
The Governing Board of the International Partnership for Microbicides, (Washington D.C., USA).Herfkens is not married. She is currently living in Maryland (US) with her partner Costas Michalopoulos.


== Controversy ==
In early 2008, the provision by the Dutch government to Herfkens for the use of an apartment – while she was working for the Millennium Campaign and living in New York City during the period November 2002 until January 2006 – stirred up controversy (e.g.). The Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs acknowledged in his letter to the Dutch Parliament of 28 August 2008 that: ""The provision of allowances to Ms. Herfkens (over $7000 per month, totalling $280,000) was (supposed to be) in conformity with the policy at the time to promote the appointment of Dutch nationals to international organizations; was in agreement with the relevant regulations; and was also applied in other cases""; and, further, that regarding Herfkens ""there is no question of violation of the Ministry's regulations."" The Minister added in his letter: ""I regret that in the public debate the impression was wrongly created that Herfkens acted reproachably vis-a-vis the Ministry by accepting allowances.""It is however, against U.N. rules to offer and accept such benefits; and this Dutch policy has been changed recently. UNDP has conducted and completed an internal review regarding this matter. The review concluded that the Dutch government should have known that the provision of such benefits violated U.N. Staff Regulations. The review also concluded that, while Herfkens did break U.N. rules by accepting the use of an apartment whose rent was paid by the Dutch government, she did so unknowingly and in good faith; and that lack of induction, given the haste in which the MDG Campaign office was set up, also contributed to her not being aware of the prohibition of receiving benefits from a Member. In light of these conclusions, UNDP considers the matter closed. On 28 August 2008, Dutch Foreign minister Verhagen reported the problem had been solved and the Dutch government was not intending to pursue the matter further. As part of this solution Herfkens would keep her job for another year on a $1 per year salary basis.
