14,"Frauke Petry (German: [ˈfʁaʊkə ˈpeːtʁiː]; née Marquardt; born 1 June 1975) is a German politician who chaired the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from July 2015 to September 2017. A chemist by training and with a professional background as a businesswoman, some political scientists described Petry as a representative of the national conservative wing of that party.Petry had formerly served as one of three party spokespersons from 2013 to 2015, and became leader in 2015, displacing the party's founder Bernd Lucke after an internal power struggle; Lucke subsequently left the party and said it has ""fallen irretrievably into the wrong hands"" after Petry's election. Petry left the party in turn after stating it had become ""anarchical"" and unable to provide a ""credible platform"".Petry is noted for her anti-Islam views, for her calls to ban minarets, and for arguing that German police should ""use firearms if necessary"" to prevent illegal border-crossings. She led the Blue Party until its dissolution in late 2019.


== Early life ==
Petry was born on 1 June 1975 to a chemist and an engineer in Dresden in what was then East Germany. She lived in Schwarzheide, Brandenburg, near Saxony until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, after which her family moved to Bergkamen in Westphalia. Petry took her first degree in chemistry at the University of Reading, England, in 1998, before attending the University of Göttingen, from where she gained a doctorate in 2004. She was supported by a scholarship of the Studienstiftung.


== Political orientation ==
Petry was described as a representative of the national conservative wing of her party. To the contrary, political scientist Cas Mudde described her as a representative of the far-right wing of her party. Petry describes herself as national-conservative and supporting policies of ""national self-determinism"". Der Spiegel reports that her electoral success on 4 July 2015, which gave her the reins of leadership in the AfD in preference to Bernd Lucke (the party's founder) was made possible by the national-conservative wing of the party. Lucke's wing did not have the majority.On the subject of the political spectrum, Petry has said, ""Right and left are terms that haven't fitted for a long time"". Petry believes sharia is incompatible with the ""democratic and liberal order of state"" and has said that the majority within her AfD favors a liberal-conservative policy.


=== Border control ===
In January 2016, when a reporter from the regional newspaper Mannheimer Morgen asked her about European and German border policies, Petry answered that the German Border police must do their jobs by ""hindering illegal entry of refugees"". The reporter followed up on her response, using the term Schießbefehl which means ""order to shoot"". Petry stated that she did not use that term, going on to state that no policeman ""wants to fire on a refugee and I don't want that either"" but that border police must follow the law to maintain the integrity of European borders. Afterwards, Petry made several attempts to justify these statements.


=== Male circumcision ===
In a rough draft of its manifesto, the AfD had considered adopting a stance stating that male circumcision should be outlawed, but Petry said in her interview with Tim Sebastian on 21 March 2016 that this language would not be in the final draft. The Central Council of Jews in Germany is also in an uproar over the question of religious circumcision, stating that to give precedence to a child's self-determination over his parents' right of freedom of religion is ""an unprecedented and dramatic intrusion on the right to self-determination of religious communities"". This national dialogue is happening in the wake of a 2012 decision of a Higher Regional Court in Cologne, which called the circumcision of a 4-year-old boy ""bodily harm"".


=== Women in society ===
Unlike the SPD, Petry does not believe mandatory quotas are the right way to give opportunities to women, nor does she believe they improve the chances of women having more leadership positions. She believes quotas make women unsure of whether a promotion would be made on the basis of qualifications.Regarding the issue of burqas, Petry believes it should not be compulsory for women to dress in such a manner. She has said that in schools ""this sort of religious costume should not be worn"".


=== Migration ===
On the issue of international migration, Petry is of the view that, ""We [Germany and the rest of Europe] have to decide what sort of migration we want to accept"". She has said, ""Deciding about who's migrating and who's not, who's going to be part of a new country is, in the end, a question of borders, whether you see them, or whether you don't. When I go to France, I don't see the border, but I know it's there and I accept it, be it in terms of speed limits, or be it in terms of laws and legislation"".


== Resignation from AfD ==
In April 2017, Petry stepped down as AfD's candidate for chancellor due to reports that she wanted to change the party's policies to appeal to more moderate voters. This came after she had frequently criticised Björn Höcke, a party representative who had called the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin a ""monument of shame"", and backed attempts to expel him, but could not prevail in a power struggle with her party rivals Jörg Meuthen and Alexander Gauland, who accused her of splitting party ranks. Despite the internal strife, her party voted to allow her to run for a seat in the German parliament in the September 2017 elections.One day after election night in which Petry was elected to the Bundestag by direct mandate, she left an AfD press conference saying that she won't join the party's parliamentary group in the Bundestag because the party became too ""anarchical"" and ""could not offer a credible platform"". Alice Weidel, the AfD's frontrunner, demanded her resignation from the party. Petry will join the Bundestag as an independent politician. She resigned from the party and all offices on 29 September 2017. She was subsequently charged with perjury for allegedly lying under oath about her former party's finances. She was convicted and sentenced to a fine of 6,000 euros. In 2020, the Federal Court of Justice overturned the conviction on the grounds that the law on perjury did not apply to the context in which she made the false statements.On 12 October 2017, Petry announced that she would form a new party, called the Blue Party, which would provide a ""reasonable conservative"" agenda and seek to replicate the success of the Bavarian Christian Social Union. In late 2019, that party was dissolved.Petry made a reappearance in public during a April 2021 interview with Kurt Krömer in which she spoke about the Alternative for Germany donation scandal. She revealed that she would be writing a book about her time as AfD leader. The book was subsequently published as Requiem for the AfD in which Petry argued the party had become a ""chaotic protest party"" no longer interested in governing after she resigned as leader and accused politicians within the party of being blackmailed into accepting undeclared donations.


== Personal life ==
In 2007, Petry founded her own business, PURinvent, a Leipzig-based manufacturer of polyurethane tire fill products. She received the Medal of the Order of Merit in 2012.Petry separated from her husband, Sven Petry, a Lutheran pastor, in October 2015, stating that this was by mutual consent and that the two remained friends and would continue to share in the upbringing of their four children. Frauke Petry also revealed that ""much more than just friendly feelings"" had developed between her and Marcus Pretzell, a fellow AfD party member. At about the same time, it was announced that Sven Petry had joined the CDU. In December 2016, Petry married Pretzell, by then her domestic partner. Having had two further children with Pretzell, Petry now has six altogether and lives in Tautenhain, Saxony.Petry is a member of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony, a member church of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). She criticizes many stances of the EKD, which historically holds a largely liberal Protestant stance, claiming it follows ""only its own interests"" regarding immigration. In 2016 she advocated its cooperation with AfD in order to defend the European Christian values of the West.

18,"Caroline Scheufele (born 14 December 1961) is a German-born Swiss business woman. She is the artistic director and co-president of Chopard, the Swiss-based luxury watches and jewellery manufacturer. She is the daughter of Karl and Karin Scheufele, German entrepreneurs who purchased the company in 1963.
During the 1980s, Scheufele expanded the business into the jewelry sector.
In 1998, Scheufele redesigned the Palme d'Or for the Cannes Film Festival, and made Chopard an official event partner. Under her direction, the brand became one of the first to grow the market in sustainable luxury goods and ethical gold.


== Early life and education ==
Caroline Scheufele was born in Pforzheim in Germany. Her parents managed the watchmaking company Eszeha, based in Pforzheim. In 1963, her father Karl acquired the Geneva-based watch manufacturer Chopard, and over the following years, the family traveled back and forth between Germany and Switzerland.At the age of 12, Caroline moved to Switzerland in order to study at Geneva's International School along with her brother Karl-Friedrich.


== Career ==
She decided to join the family business immediately after obtaining her diploma, while enrolled in classes in Design and Gemmology. She completed a year of further training at Eszeha, spending time in each of the company departments, including export, packaging, after-sales service, and others while continuing to work in the Design Department. Back in Geneva, she joined her brother's office.


=== Launching of the jewelry side ===
In 1985, she designed an articulated clown made of floating diamonds.Her father put the piece into production. The clown was the first piece of jewelry made by Chopard and marked the company's launch into this sector. From that time onward, the company developed the jewelry side of its business, later expanding into fine jewelry.


=== The Palme d'Or ===
In 1997, Chopard opened a boutique in Cannes. Caroline Scheufele wanted to link the boutique's opening to the festival. She headed to Paris to meet Pierre Viot, Director of the Cannes Film Festival. The Palme d'Or used to consist of a gold plated palm leaf resting on a Plexiglas pyramid. Its design had remained unchanged for 50 years. Pierre Viot invited her to redesign the award piece and she agreed. Scheufele redesigned the Palme d'Or for the Cannes Film Festival and made Chopard the official event partner from 1998 onwards. Since that time, the award has been manufactured within the company's workshops.


=== 2001: Co-Presidency ===
In 2001, Caroline Scheufele and her brother Karl-Friedrich were named co-presidents of the company. Caroline is the artistic director in charge of fine jewelry, design and artwork, as well as perfume and accessories. Her brother is in charge of watches, innovation and business strategy. They jointly manage marketing, publicity and communications.
Scheufele is also in charge of international retail and travels the world to introduce the brand to other countries.She has established partnerships with charitable organizations such as Elton John AIDS Foundation, The Prince's Trust, the José Carreras Leukaemia Foundation, Petra Nemcova's All Hands And Hearts – Smart Response, Natalia Vodianova's Naked Heart Foundation, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's Education Above All, and the WWF.


== Ethical gold ==
Under the direction of Scheufele, Chopard has become one of the first brands to use raw materials that meet the highest possible social and environmental standards, and supports Fairmined certified responsible gold. In 2010, the brand joined the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), which sets out a code of good conduct and promotes responsible practices.In 2011, Scheufele met Livia Firth, wife of actor Colin Firth, who is involved in sustainable development. As the founder of Green Carpet Challenge, Livia Firth encourages brands to invest in more ethical designs. Following their encounter, Scheufele created a collection made entirely from ethical gold certified by Fairmined and diamonds from certified members of the Responsible Jewellery Council. Fairmined gold is extracted from sustainable mines supported by the Alliance for Responsible Mining. Since 2014, the Palme d'Or has been made in Fairmined certified ethical gold.Over time, Scheufele has forged partnerships and agreements with various players operating in the responsibly extracted ethical gold market and developed the production of sustainable jewelry and watches. As of 2018, all Chopard watches and jewelry are made in 100% ethical gold.


== Record ==
In 2015, Caroline Scheufele acquired one of the world's largest and purest raw diamonds from a mine in Botswana on behalf of Chopard. She used this 342-carat diamond, known as the ""Queen of Kalahari"", to create a high jewelry collection that was exhibited in Paris in 2018 and baptized ""The Garden of Kalahari"".

In 2008, she co-founded the biotechnology company BioNTech, which in 2020 developed the first messenger RNA-based vaccine approved for use against COVID-19. Türeci has served as BioNTech's chief medical officer since 2018. Since 2021, she has been Professor of Personalized Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Institute for Translational Oncology (HI-TRON) and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Türeci and her spouse, Uğur Şahin, have won a number of awards.


== Personal life and education ==
Born in Siegen, West Germany in 1967, Türeci is the daughter of Turkish immigrants. Her mother was a biologist. Her father, a surgeon, was from Istanbul and worked at the Catholic hospital St. Elisabeth-Stift in Lastrup in the district of Cloppenburg. She attended, among others, the Städtisches Gymnasium in Bad Driburg and the Werner-von-Siemens-Gymnasium in Bad Harzburg. As a child, she was strongly inspired by the nuns who worked to help people at the hospital her father worked at.She studied medicine at Saarland University in Homburg and received her doctorate from the Medical Faculty of Saarland in 1992. She was a Heisenberg fellow of the German Research Foundation. Her research focused on the identification and characterization of tumor-specific molecules and the development of immunotherapies against cancer. In 2002, she completed her habilitation qualification at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz in the field of molecular medicine.
While completing her final year of studies, Türeci met her future husband, Uğur Şahin, who was working at Saarland University Hospital in Homburg. They discovered that they shared an interest in using the body's immune system to fight cancer. The couple married in 2002 and had a daughter four years later. Although Türeci and her husband became billionaires as a result of their business interests, the family continues to live modestly.Due to the proposition of the Rhineland-Palatinate parliamentary group of the SPD, she will be a voting member of the 17th Federal Assembly for the 2022 German presidential election.Türeci has been an honorary citizen of the state capital Mainz since March 2022.


== Career ==
Özlem Türeci works as a medical scientist and basic researcher in the field of immunology. She researches target structures in order to develop new therapies against cancer, infectious diseases and diseases of the immune and nervous systems. One focus is on the identification and characterization of tumor-specific molecules and the development of personalized therapeutic approaches.


=== University Medicine Mainz ===
Türeci was a staff member of the University Medical Center Mainz in the special research area of immunology. Since 2002, she has been a private lecturer there in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Together with her husband and their mentor, the immunologist Christoph Huber, she developed the concept of a ""translational institute"", which was realized in 2001 with the foundation of TRON, short for ""translational oncology."" This is a biopharmaceutical research institute that develops new diagnostics and drugs for the therapy of cancer and other diseases with high unmet medical needs. Two companies later founded by Türeci and her husband are spin-offs of work done at the university in Mainz. Türeci accepted the appointment to the professorship for ""Personalized Immunotherapy"" at the University Medicine of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and the Helmholtz Institute ""HI-TRON Mainz"" founded in 2019 at the end of 2021.


=== Ganymed Pharmaceuticals ===
In 2001, Türeci and her future husband founded the company Ganymed Pharmaceuticals. This company focused on a new class of cancer drugs called ideal monoclonal antibodies and developed zolbetuximab, which is used to treat esophageal and gastric cancer. She was chief scientific officer from 2001 to 2008 and led the company from 2008 to 2016 in the role of chief executive officer. In 2016, the company was sold to Astellas Pharma for $1.4 billion and is now a subsidiary of that company.


=== BioNTech ===
In 2008, Türeci, her husband, and Christoph Huber founded the Mainz-based biotechnology company BioNTech, choosing a name derived from Biopharmaceutical New Technologies.  Türeci has been Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the company since 2018. As CMO, she is primarily responsible for Clinical Research and Development. From 2009 to 2018, she served as chair of the company's scientific advisory board. Originally, the company focused on the development and manufacturing of active immunotherapies based on Messenger RNA (mRNA) and other technologies for a patient-specific approach to the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. Along with researchers from TRON, they hired Katalin Karikó, who had developed a way to avoid triggering an inflammatory reaction when injecting an mRNA drug.


==== Project Lightspeed – Development of Covid-19 vaccine ====
In January 2020, Türeci's husband read an article in The Lancet medical journal regarding a novel coronavirus later named COVID-19. Concerned that a pandemic could be coming, the couple decided to apply the mRNA vaccine technology they had been researching for two decades to developing a vaccine against the disease, which at the time was spreading in China.They convinced the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer, with whom they had previously begun working on an influenza vaccine, to help with development and distribution costs. By March 2020, they had five vaccine candidates ready to test in humans, and by November 2020, results indicated that the vaccine was more than 90% effective. The following month, the vaccine was authorized for use in Britain and the United States, and the first patient was injected at a hospital in Coventry. As of February 2021, BioNTech was planning to produce 2 billion doses of their vaccine by the end of 2021.Türeci was responsible for the clinical trials in the development of the vaccine called BNT162b2 (the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine, sold under the brand name Comirnaty).  Türeci credits the rapid success of the project in part to international collaboration, including Pfizer and the Chinese firm Fosun Pharma. BioNTech itself has staff from 60 countries.Türeci and her husband were named Financial Times People of the Year for 2020 based on their ability to produce a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 less than a year after the genetic sequence of the virus was released, an achievement cited as ""one of the greatest medical breakthroughs of our time."" They also appeared on the cover of the American news magazine Time in January 2021.


==== Current initiatives ====
Using funds from the successful vaccine, BioNTech plans to pursue its original goal of creating an mRNA-based cancer vaccine; Türeci remarked in March 2021 that the company had several vaccines, with the expectation of offering them to patients within 2 years. Ideally, they will be able to design tailor-made therapies for individual patients. So far, they have treated over 440 patients with 17 types of tumors.In addition, BioNTech is working on an mRNA vaccine to prevent malaria and investigating the production of vaccines in Africa.


=== Other ===
Türeci has filed more than 500 international patent applications and published more than 110 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. She is internationally active as a lecturer.

39,"Ilse Aigner (born 7 December 1964) is a German politician and member of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU).
Aigner was born in Feldkirchen-Westerham, Bavaria, and entered Angela Merkel's grand coalition cabinet as Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection on 31 October 2008. She succeeded Horst Seehofer, who had become Minister President of Bavaria. She left her position on 30 September 2013 after being elected as a member of the Bavarian parliament.
From 2013, she served as Deputy Minister-President of Bavaria. In addition, she served as State Minister of Economic Affairs; and Media, Energy and Technology (2013–2018) and State Minister of Construction and Transport (2018). After Horst Seehofer resigned as Minister President in order to become Federal Minister of the Interior on 14 March 2018, Aigner became acting Minister President until the election of Markus Söder as Minister President. After the 2018 Bavarian State elections, she was elected as President of the Bavarian Landtag, succeeding longterm president Barbara Stamm who had lost her seat in the election.


== Education and professional background ==
Aigner completed a professional training as a telecommunications technician in 1985 and joined her parents’ electrical installation business.In 1990 she graduated from the technical academy with the degree of a State Certified Engineer and worked for several years for Eurocopter in the development of helicopter electric systems.Aigner was elected first in 1994 to the Bavarian State Parliament.


=== Member of the German Bundestag, 1998–2013 ===
From 1998 Aigner was a member of the German Bundestag, always winning an absolute majority of the votes in her electoral district.

From 2002 to 2005, she was a member of the Budget Committee, where she served as her parliamentary group’s rapporteur on the budgets of the Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture (BMELV) and the aerospace technology portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). From 2005 to 2008, she served as her parliamentary group’s spokesperson for education and research policy.


=== Federal Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, 2008–2013 ===
Aigner was a little-known member of parliament with no previous ministerial experience when she took over as Federal Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture in the cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2008, replacing Horst Seehofer.During her time in office, Aigner steered through a 2011 dioxins scare that saw contaminated eggs and meat from Germany going to six neighbouring countries. In response, she imposed tough new safety standards for animal feed manufacturers, a move widely supported in the market to retain public confidence.She took a tough line against cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Germany but received praise from commodity traders when she supported imports of GMOs approved in the United States and South America to secure German supplies of soybeans for animal feed. Meanwhile, she repeatedly expressed concern that outside financial investment in agricultural commodity markets distorts prices, instead calling for more transparency in commodity markets and clear visibility of the difference between futures investment by industrial food buyers and financial investors.In 2009, Aigner caused a controversy when she called for requirements to publish the names and location of recipients of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies to be “suspended” until the implications for data protection have been assessed. In response, the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Mariann Fischer Boel threatened Germany with legal action.Aigner has been outspoken in her criticism of Facebook, which she has said needs to do to protect its users′ privacy.
In September 2011, she asked all federal ministers in Germany not to use Facebook for public relations and communication. In 2010, she criticized Google over plans to give property owners a four-week deadline to stop their buildings from showing up on the company's then newly launched Street View mapping service, demanding that all requests be considered instead.Amid the German debate on the country′s energy transition to an energy portfolio dominated by renewable energy, Aigner called in later 2012 for the partial nationalization of the country′s electrical grid in order to ensure that high-voltage power lines required to transport green energy from offshore windfarms and other sources to the industry-heavy regions of southern Germany are built.In 2012, Aigner announced she would leave her post to return to local politics in her home state of Bavaria following the 2013 national elections, prompting speculation that she was eyeing the post of Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer. This seemed even more likely as she had been elected chairwoman of her party′s Upper Bavaria district association in 2011, the largest and most powerful CSU subdivision.


=== Deputy Minister-President of Bavaria, 2013–2018 ===
Following her return to Bavaria after the state′s 2013 elections, Aigner was named Minister-President Horst Seehofer′s deputy as well as Bavarian Minister for Economic Affairs, Media, Energy and Technology. As one of Bavaria′s representatives at the Bundesrat, she served on the Committee on Cultural Affairs; the Committee on Economic Affairs; and the Committee on the Environment, Nature Protection and Reactor Safety.
In the negotiations to form a grand coalition following the 2013 national elections, Aigner led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on economic affairs; her co-chair from the SPD was Hubertus Heil. On 17 December 2013, she became the first woman to ever chair a meeting of the Bavarian State Government.In the cabinet of Minister-President Markus Söder, Aigner briefly served as State Minister of Construction and Transport in 2018. On the Bundesrat, she became a member of the Committee on Transport and of the Committee on Urban Development, Housing and Regional Planning.


=== President of the Bavarian Landtag, 2018–present ===
On 5 November 2018, Aigner was elected with 198 of 205 votes as new President of the Bavarian Landtag. 
After the 2023 Bavarian state election she was re-elected with 164 of 200 votes.

53,"Kerstin Andreae (born 21 October 1968) is a German politician of Alliance '90/The Greens who served as Member of the Bundestag from 2002 to 2019. Since leaving politics, she has been serving as managing director of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW).


== Education ==
After graduating from high school in 1988, Andreae studied political science and economics at the University of Freiburg. In 1998 she worked as press secretary and campaign manager to Wilfried Telkämper, then a Member of the European Parliament.


== Political career ==
From 1999 to 2002, Andreae was a member of the city council in Freiburg im Breisgau.
In 2002, Andreae was first elected into the German Bundestag. Between 2005 and 2007, she served as the Green parliamentary groups’ coordinator in the Finance Committee. From March 2007 to March 2012 she was the groups’ spokesperson for economic affairs and coordinator in the Committee on Economic Affairs and Technology. In 2012, she succeeded Fritz Kuhn as the group's deputy chairperson, at the time led by co-chairs Renate Künast and Jürgen Trittin.
After the 2013 federal elections, Andreae — who is considered a centrist in her party — unsuccessfully tried to become the chairwoman of the Green's parliamentary group. Commentators regarded her loss against Katrin Göring-Eckardt as a sign that Green lawmakers rejected a chance to reach out to Angela Merkel’s CDU as a possible coalition partner. In 2019, she set up the group’s business advisory board, a gathering of around 50 corporate leaders from different sectors.In 2019, Andreae was appointed as managing director of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW).


== Political positions ==


=== Economic policy ===
In late 2013, when the government announced its plan to significantly increase social expenditures for the current generation of pensioners, Andreae called this a ""flagrant pillaging of pension funds"" and a ""socially unjust"" burden on lower- and middle-income individuals.In 2014, Andreae criticised the government's approval of utility group RWE selling its oil and gas unit RWE Dea to investors led by Russia's second-richest man Mikhail Fridman.


=== Human rights ===
In August 2012, Andreae was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy Riot. “Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are Draconian and disproportionate,” the lawmakers said in the letter. “In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts -- even if they can be seen as provocative -- must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.”
