She served as Minister for Finances from 2022 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she has led the nation's financial sector through the economic crisis caused by the inflation surge and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Prior to her appointment as minister, she held several key diplomatic positions, and was the diplomatic advisor to prime ministers Jean-Claude Juncker and Xavier Bettel.


== Early life and education ==
Yuriko Nadia Backes was born on 22 December 1970 in Kobe, Japan. Her parents were Luxembourgish expatriates who lived in Japan. After briefly living in Germany, the family returned to Japan, residing in the Tokyo area for eleven years. Backes attended the Canadian Academy International School in Kobe, graduating in 1989 with an International Baccalaureate diploma. She continued her studies in London, graduating from the London School of Economics with a bachelor's degree in international relations in 1992 and from the School of Oriental and African Studies with a master's degree in Japanese studies in 1993. The following year, she received a master's degree in European political and administrative studies from the College of Europe in Bruges.


== Diplomatic career ==
Backes began her diplomatic career within the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1994, when she passed her diplomatic examinations and was appointed a member of the permanent representation of Luxembourg to the United Nations, serving for three years. In 2001, she was named deputy director of the Directorate of European Affairs and International Economic Relations in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 until 2006, Backes was a member of the permanent representation of Luxembourg to the European Union, and from 2006 until 2008, she was the deputy head of mission of the Embassy of Luxembourg in Japan.From 2008 to 2010, Backes was deputy head of the Directorate for International Economic Relations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2010 until June 2016, she was the diplomatic adviser for prime ministers Jean-Claude Juncker and Xavier Bettel. From 2016 until 2020, she was the representative of the European Commission to Luxembourg, becoming the first woman to hold the office.On 1 June 2020, Backes was appointed Luxembourg's first female Hofmarschall (French: Maréchale de la Cour, English: Marshal of the Court), the highest administrative position in the household of Grand Duke Henri. In this role, she oversaw and organized the day-to-day activities of the Grand Duke.


== Political career ==


=== Finance minister ===
On 3 December 2021, the ruling coalition government announced that Backes would become the new Minister for Finances, succeeding Pierre Gramegna and becoming the first woman to hold the office. Previously unaffiliated with any political party, she declared her intent to join the Democratic Party and run as one of its candidates for the Chamber of Deputies in the 2023 elections. Backes is also affiliated with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. She was sworn in by Grand Duke Henri on 5 January 2022.Though initially intending her tenure to operate ad interim with a ""simple"" economic framework, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began the month after she took office, exasperated Luxembourg's ongoing inflation crisis. A proponent of European solidarity against Russia, Backes is an outspoken supporter of Ukraine. At the April 2022 IMF/World Bank summit in Washington, D.C., she ""underlined Luxembourg's commitment to multilateralism and international solidarity"" and ""reaffirmed Luxembourg's pledge to allocate 1% of its GNI to development aid"". She also reiterated Luxembourg's support for Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian finance minister Serhiy Marchenko.Backes is also a proponent of closer relations between Luxembourg and Asia. In April 2022, she met with several Japanese CEOs regarding economic cooperation between the two nations. In May 2023, she travelled to China, where she held meetings with finance minister Liu Kun, China Securities Regulatory Commission chairman Yi Huiman, and several Chinese bank officials. Among the topics of discussion were capital market cooperation, green finance, and Luxembourg's desire to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties with China.In 2023, Backes declared that Luxembourg was in the midst of an economic crisis primarily caused by inflation. Though she opposed a decrease in the tax rate, she instead backing a proposal which would distribute targeted tax credits totaling €500 million as a response to the crisis. She also oversaw a 1% reduction in the value-added tax as part of an inflation-reduction measure, as well as the implementation of international taxation on multinational corporations based in Luxembourg, which affected around 7,500 firms. In December 2022, her proposed budget, which ""avoided austerity"" while keeping investment and solidarity spending high, passed through the legislature and allowed Luxembourg to retain its AAA credit rating from Fitch Ratings.In late 2022, Backes highlighted the importance of the fight against money laundering in Luxembourg, stating that failing an audit from the Financial Action Task Force would ""permanently compromise Luxembourg's reputation as a financial centre"". She is also a supporter of the digital transformation and the Digital Services Act.


== Personal life ==
Backes has two children. She is fluent in Luxembourgish, German, French, and English, and is conversational in Japanese.

Throughout her time in office, she maintained a constant dialogue with Russian Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin and Russia's PACE delegates.


=== On Azerbaijan ===
On a 2014 visit to Azerbaijan, a member country of the Council of Europe, Brasseur criticized that ""[i]n certain areas, such as freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly, the situation appears to have deteriorated and this has to be addressed urgently."" In particular, she expressed her hope that Azeri human rights activist Ilgar Mammadov would soon be released, after the European Court of Human Rights had earlier described his imprisonment as an ""unjustified restriction of freedom"".

=== On education ===
In June 2007, the Council of Europe's Committee on Culture, Science and Education released a report entitled ""The Dangers of Creationism in Education."" According to Brasseur, who served as co-author of the report, its goal was to firmly anchor the theory of evolution in school curricula. However, she was later pressured to shorten references in the resolution to ""evolution by natural selection"" to ""evolution"" because some members had misunderstood the reference to natural selection to be an attack on their religious beliefs. The council ultimately approved the report's recommendations, with 48 votes in favor and 25 against.

5,"Carole Dieschbourg (born 3 October 1977) is a Luxembourg politician and writer. Since December 2013, she was Minister for the Environment representing the Green in the government coalition consisting of the Democratic Party, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party and the Green Party until her resignation and replacement by Energy Minister Claude Turmes in 2022. She represented Luxembourg at the COP22 Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, November 2016.


== Biography ==
Born in Ettelbruck on 3 October 1977, Dieschbourg matriculated from the Lycée classique d'Echternach in 1997 before studying historical sciences and German at the University of Trier, earning a Master of Arts in 2005. In 2005, she became coordinator of ""Moulins – inventaire, excursion et sentier régional"" (Mills – inventory, excursion and regional trail) under the Leader + Müllerthal programme, publishing Die Mühlen des Müllerthals (The Mullerthal Mills) in 2007.In 2011, Dieschbourg entered politics as a municipal councillor in Echternach. Following the elections on 20 October 2013, she joined the Luxembourg government, becoming Minister for the Environment on 4 December 2013. Prior to her governmental appointment, she was a board member of Moulin J.P. Dieschbourg, a family business established in 1897.Interviewed by Romain Van Dyck in the Luxembourg newspaper Le Quotidien on 7 November 2016, she stressed the importance of arriving at a European position at the Climate Conference in Marrakesh rather than agreements with individual countries. Luxembourg would above all be contributing by bringing about a major reduction in carbon emissions from road vehicles. She announced that the country would have 800 recharging facilities for electric cars by 2020 compared with 3,000 for the whole of France.


== The “garden shed” scandal ==
In 2019 and subsequent years, Carlo Dieschbourg was suspected of favoritism in granting a late planning permission for building works on a garden shed to Roberto Traversini in 2019, at the time member of the Green and mayor of Differdange, in a protected area called Natura 2000 even though the construction of said shed had already started without the latter requesting a permission in due time.
Due to her diplomatic immunity, Dieschbourg couldn't be questioned in her official capacity at the time. The Chamber of Deputies therefore would have to vote on whether to lift her immunity, requiring a formal process involving lawmakers.
In 2022, Dieschbourg affirmed that she would advise lawmakers to support this course of action, stating, “There is not doubt for me that the lifting of my immunity is the right path”. However, just hours thereafter, she tearfully announced her resignation at a press conference. While maintaining her innocence, Dieschbourg explained that parliament had crucial matters to attend to, and initiating proceedings against her would consume valuable time. She expressed, “I don’t want this anymore”, particularly in light of the numerous hearings that had already taken place in 2019. As a result, Energy Minister Claude Turmes of the Green took over her mandate as interim minister. A preliminary investigation by the Luxembourg public prosecutor’s office to assess whether the case will go to trial had been ongoing since 2019 and a request had been sent to the Chamber of Deputies for a vote on Dieschbourg’s immunity. In March 2023, the deputies adopted a resolution to lift her immunity and by April 2023 the judicial police has started questioning Dieschbourg regarding this matter.
