== Early life and education ==
Nathalie Appéré was born on 8 July 1975 in Ploemeur, Morbihan.Appéré moved to Rennes in 1993 after obtaining her baccalauréat. She enrolled in Sciences Po Rennes and graduated in 1996, writing a senior thesis titled ""Study for a Diagnostic and the Definition of a Research Strategy in the Rennes Agglomeration: Final Report Relating to the Study Contract with the City of Rennes–University of Rennes 1"" with Jacques Hardy as her advisor. Appéré then became a lecturer in public law.Appéré's professional career centred around city politics and urban social development. She first entered the public service as a research analyst for the Regional Institute of Social Work in Rennes from 1996 to 1998, after which she took up the post of director of public infrastructure for Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande from 2000 to 2008.


== Political career ==
After arriving in Rennes, Appéré joined the Young Socialist Movement at the age of 20 during the 1995 French presidential election. She became a member of the Socialist Party (PS) and took up several departmental posts within the party, notably that of spokesperson for the Socialist federation of Ille-et-Vilaine.Appéré joined Edmond Hervé's electoral list for Rennes in the 2001 municipal elections, after which she was appointed deputy mayor for community living. It was in this position that she led major city projects such as the reform of the Rennes Social and Cultural Office.


=== Rise to prominence ===
Appéré was the director of Daniel Delaveau's successful campaign for mayor of Rennes in the 2008 municipal elections, after which she was appointed first deputy mayor, in charge of Solidarity, and vice-president of Rennes Métropole, in charge of Social Cohesion. Among her initiatives were the implementation of the ""Sortir"" tourism card, providing discounts for visitors to cultural and entertainment attractions in Rennes, as well as the rehabilitation of the city's heritage district.Appéré also served as the president of the supervisory board of Guillaume-Régnier hospital from 2010 to 2012.

The body is presided over by the Prime Minister of France and discusses issues surrounding municipal politics, neighbourhood public policy and territorial difficulties.Appéré endorsed François Hollande in the PS' 2011 open presidential primary.


=== Member of the National Assembly ===
During the 2002 French legislative elections, Appéré was elected as the designated substitute of Philippe Tourtelier, Socialist deputy for Ille-et-Vilaine's 2nd constituency. After Tourtelier announced that he would not run for a third term in the 2012 legislative elections, Appéré was nominated by the PS in his riding. Speaking after receiving the nomination, she promised party activists that she would resign her executive offices in Rennes but also signalled that she would continue to sit on the city's municipal council. Appéré was elected to the National Assembly on 17 June 2012, winning 63.45% of the vote in the second round against Bertrand Plouvier of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).In December 2012, she declared her candidacy for the Socialist nomination for mayor of Rennes in the 2014 French municipal elections. Although Appéré had previously stated her opposition to the law on the accumulation of electoral mandates several times, she ultimately announced that she would serve out her full term as deputy if she were to be elected to the mayoralty.


=== Mayor of Rennes ===


==== First term ====
Appéré was elected mayor of Rennes on 4 April 2014 with 55.83% of the vote in the second round after forming an alliance with the Europe Ecology – The Greens–Left Front electoral list. She thus became the city's first female mayor.The beginning of Appéré's term was marked by several violent protests against the Grand Ouest Airport project in January 2016 as well as the El Khomri law between March and May of the same year. She responded by demanding a ""clear decision from the French state"" on the airport. Further riots broke out after the announcement of the El Khomri law, with a 20-year-old student notably losing an eye in the violence on 28 April. This led student protesters to interrupt a session of the Rennes municipal council on 2 May, calling for the mayor to put an end to police brutality.In 2016, Appéré endorsed Manuel Valls in the 2017 Socialist presidential primary and joined his campaign's organizational staff. Valls was defeated in the primary by Benoît Hamon, whom Appéré subsequently endorsed in the presidential election.In accordance with the law on the accumulation of electoral mandates, Appéré did not seek re-election in the 2017 French legislative elections. In 2018, she supported Olivier Faure for first secretary of the PS during its Aubervilliers Congress. Appéré was appointed to the party's national bureau on 15 April of that year.On 12 February 2019, the City Mayors Foundation awarded Appéré a World Mayor Commendation, along with Mayor Ros Jones of Doncaster, Mayor Charlotte Britz of Saarbrücken and Mayor Beng Climaco of Zamboanga City. The foundation announced that she had received the distinction for her housing policies, establishment of a participatory budget system and overseeing of demographic and economic development.Appéré's first term also saw the opening of the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire high-speed railway in July 2017, the Convent of the Jacobins Convention Centre in January 2018 and the renovated Rennes station in July 2019. Other infrastructure projects included two new public parks—the Saint-Martin Meadows and Baud Beaches.


==== 2020 Rennes municipal election campaign ====


===== Pre-election manoeuvres =====
On 26 June 2019, Appéré launched a discussion platform named ""200 Days for Rennes"" in the lead-up to the 2020 French municipal elections. The platform had a website with the address ""avecnathalieappere.fr"" (""With Nathalie Appéré""). In an interview with Ouest-France on 13 September, she confirmed that she would be a candidate in the upcoming municipal elections but would begin her campaign later than her competitors, citing her ongoing consideration of whether to run for the presidency of Rennes Métropole following the expected retirement of Socialist incumbent Emmanuel Couet. She received the endorsement of deputy François André, an independent affiliated with the La République En Marche group, four days later. Nevertheless, La République En Marche itself announced that it would be running its own electoral list in the elections.


===== Campaign and policy platform =====
Appéré announced her candidacy for the mayoralty of Rennes and the presidency of Rennes Métropole on 10 December 2019, during an 800-person event at Rennes' Le Liberté performance hall concluding the 200 Days for Rennes campaign. The latter ended after collecting the views of 1 000 Rennais, according to its organizers. Appéré was joined by representatives from the French Communist Party, the Radical Party of the Left, Génération.s and Place Publique who declared their parties' support for her campaign. The event also saw her announce the first planks of her platform, such as the creation of five rapid transit bus lines, which she called ""trambuses,"" the laying out of 100 kilometres of safe bicycle lanes, the adoption of free public transit for riders under 12 years old, the planting of 30 000 trees in six years, the uncovering of the Vilaine river in front of the Palace of Commerce as well as the establishment of a nighttime municipal police department and a police brigade combating anti-social behaviour.The following month, Appéré had the City of Rennes acquire the Jacques Cartier Prison with plans of converting it into a cultural attraction. She also announced the construction of an aquatic centre that would replace a public pool in the neighbourhood of Villejean. Appéré released her full platform on 7 February 2020, which included commitments to create citizens' panels for urban redevelopment projects and the redefinition of certain municipal policies, build a ""Neighbourhood of Creation"" for ""cultural and creative industries"" next to the city's SNCF station and never increase local taxes. On 21 February, she confirmed her candidacy for president of Rennes Métropole and joined 25 other electoral list leaders and 12 incumbent mayors in unveiling a metropolitan platform.On 5 March, Appéré held a rally in advance of the first round of the elections that attracted 800 people. The following day, she received the public endorsement of former mayor Edmond Hervé, under whom she had served as deputy mayor from 2001 to 2008.


===== Re-election victory =====
The first round of the election on 15 March 2020 was marked by the rapidly worsening COVID-19 pandemic. Appéré's list won 32.77% of the vote, putting it in first place ahead of the lists of Matthieu Theurier and Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), Carole Gandon and La République En Marche (LREM) and Charles Compagnon and the Miscellaneous right (DVG). Due to the COVID-19 lockdown in France, the second round was postponed to 28 June. It was during this delay that Appéré announced on 30 May that she had successfully concluded an electoral pact with the EELV to unite their lists in the second round against those of Gandon and Compagnon.Appéré's list won the second round with 65.35% of the vote, though voter turnout fell to a historic low of 68.33% of the electorate. Consequently, her result was ten percentage points higher than in 2014 but consisted of almost 9 000 fewer votes. She also finished far ahead of Gandon and Compagnon's lists, which recorded 17.49% and 17.15% of the vote respectively. Responding to the results, Appéré praised the ""clear, definite and massive choice of Rennais"" and welcomed the ""large victory with pride and emotion,"" while also promising to ""work to reinforce local democracy"" to remedy low voter turnout. She additionally described Rennes as ""the vanguard of a social and environmentalist left.""


==== Second term ====
During the first session of the new municipal council on 3 July, Appéré was re-elected mayor with 51 votes against 10 blank votes and one invalid vote for Hervé cast by an opposition councillor. Speaking after assuming office, Appéré spoke of the great ""emotion [she was feeling] at this moment"" and paid homage to her predecessors. She then appointed 21 deputy mayors, including 12 candidates from her municipal election list and nine from Theurier's EELV list. Several of the latter received important portfolios like Education, Culture and Finance. Also among the nominees was the son of Edmond Hervé, Marc Hervé, whom Appéré promoted from seventh deputy mayor, in charge of Finance, to first deputy mayor, in charge of Urban Planning.


=== President of Rennes Métropole ===
Appéré stood for the presidency of Rennes Métropole during the inaugural session of its communal council on 9 July 2020. She was the sole candidate and was elected with 78 votes out of 111 councillors present. This was followed by the new president's nomination of an executive cabinet consisting of 20 vice-presidents, 12 of which were not from Rennes (one more than in the previous government). A group of 11 mayors then announced that they would form an ""independent"" group, though without leaving the opposition benches.On 24 September, Appéré was named secretary-general of France Urbaine, an association of elected officials from urban municipalities across France. She succeeded the former mayor of Nancy, André Rossinot, in this position. Six months later, she established the ""Idées en Commun"" discussion platform (originally proposed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris), to address housing issues. Appéré then joined Hidalgo on 12 September 2021 for an event launching the Paris mayor's campaign in the 2022 French presidential election.


== Personal life ==
Appéré is married and has 2 children. She lives in Rennes and has previously resided in its Maurepas-Patton neighbourhood.

A former advocacy officer for Oxfam France, she won a seat in the 2019 European Parliament election and the same year was elected co-chair with Martin Schirdewan of The Left in the European Parliament (GUE/NGL) group.


== Biography ==
Aubry was born in Fréjus in the département of Var. Her parents, Catherine Poggi-Aubry and Bruno Aubry, are journalists of Corsican origin. She first became involved with political activism while studying at the Lycée Saint-Exupéry (sixth form college) in  Saint-Raphaël in 2005, campaigning for the ""no"" vote in the referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty, and against the François Fillon educational reforms. In 2006, she organised a school protest against the First Employment Contract (contrat première embauche), a proposed law which would have made it easier for employers to dimiss young workers.Aubry continued her studies at Sciences Po in Paris, where she was president of the local branch of the National Union of Students of France. After obtaining a degree in international relations and human rights, she spent a year at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, in New York. She then did humanitarian work in Africa for three years, with Médecins du Monde in Liberia and with the Carter Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Returning to Paris, Aubry worked as a senior advocacy officer for Oxfam France from 2014 to 2018. Her particular area of interest was tax justice and inequality. She described how she tracked down multinationals who did not pay their fair share of taxes and rewarded their shareholders rather than the workers who produced the wealth. She also collaborated on a report about banks and tax havens. During this period, she lectured at Sciences Po on human rights.


== Political career ==
Although Aubry had no background in party politics, she was approached by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing party La France Insoumise, to head the party's list of candidates in 2019 European Parliament election.

The motion was blocked by other groups. Interviewed by Varsity, she said that state repression against pension protests had taken France from a country in ""social crisis to a country in a crisis of democracy"".During the Ninth European Parliament (2019-2024) Aubrey has a seat on the 
following committees: Legal Affairs; Economic and Monetary Affairs; Tax Matters (subcommittee). She was a member of the Conference of Presidents and the Delegation to the Cariform-EU Parliamentary Committee.

11,"Martine Louise Marie Aubry (French pronunciation: [maʁtin obʁi]; née Delors; born 8 August 1950) is a French politician. She was the First Secretary of the French Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste, or PS) from November 2008 to April 2012, and has been the Mayor of Lille (Nord) since March 2001; she is also the first woman to hold this position. Her father, Jacques Delors, served as Minister of Finance under President François Mitterrand and was also President of the European Commission.
Aubry joined the PS in 1974, and was appointed Minister of Labour by Prime Minister Édith Cresson in 1991, but lost her position in 1993 after the Right won the legislative elections. However, she became Minister of Social Affairs when Lionel Jospin was appointed Prime Minister in 1997. She is mostly known for having pushed the popular 35-hour workweek law, known as the ""Loi Aubry"", reducing the nominal length of the normal full-time working week from 39 to 35 hours, and the law that created Couverture maladie universelle (Universal health care coverage).
Aubry stepped down from her Cabinet post in 2001 to be elected Mayor of Lille in place of Pierre Mauroy. Aubry subsequently lost her seat in the National Assembly in the general election of 2002. In March 2008, she was re-elected Mayor of Lille, with 66.55% of the votes.
In November 2008, Aubry was elected to lead the Socialist Party, narrowly defeating Ségolène Royal. While Royal disputed the results, the Socialist Party declared on 25 November 2008 that Aubry had won the contested election. On 28 June 2011, Martine Aubry announced she would seek the Socialist nomination to run in the 2012 presidential election, ultimately losing to François Hollande, her predecessor as First Secretary.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Born in Paris, Aubry is the daughter of Jacques Delors, French Minister of Finance (1981–1985) and European Commission President (1985–1995), and his wife Marie. Aubry was educated at the lycée Notre-Dame-des-Oiseaux  and the lycée Paul-Valéry (in Paris). She holds a degree in economic science from Panthéon-Assas University.She did additional studies, gaining a diploma from the Institut des Sciences Sociales du Travail, and one from the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (or Sciences Po) in 1972. Between 1973 and 1975, Aubry studied at the École nationale d'administration (ÉNA, National School of Administration).


=== Professional career ===
In 1975 Aubry became a civil administrator at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Ministère du Travail et des Affaires sociales). During this period, she was active within the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). She became a professor at ÉNA in 1978. In addition, she was seconded to the State Council between 1980 and 1981.
Following the election of François Mitterrand to the French presidency in 1981, Aubry successively held several posts at the Ministry of Social Affairs, in the cabinets of Jean Auroux and Pierre Bérégovoy. In 1984, she investigated French asbestos policy for the Comité Permanent Amiante (Permanent Asbestos Committee, an informal public-private working group formed to manage the health problems of workers affected by asbestos). The group's deputy director, Jean-Luc Pasquier, testified before the courts to account for the group's members' actions.
After the defeat of the socialists in the French legislative election of 1986, Aubry was named Master of Requests at the State Council. From 1989-91 she worked as Assistant Director at Pechiney, working with Jean Gandois. She was involved with the opening of a plant at Dunkerque and the closure of the aluminium works at Noguères.


== Political career ==


=== Minister of Labour, Employment and Vocational Training: 1991–1993 ===
Aubry was named Minister of Labour, Employment and Vocational Training by Édith Cresson, and carried on in this capacity in the Bérégovoy ministry until March 1993. According to Jean-Luc Pasquier, she supported the controlled use of asbestos whilst all other members of the EEC supported an outright ban. She caused the French veto of a European decree against the use of asbestos. France did not ban asbestos until 1997.In January 2010, a public health judge charged with investigating former government measures on asbestos had Aubry interrogated by gendarmes in Lille.When the Right came into power at the French legislative election in 1986, Aubry started the Fondation Agir Contre l'Exclusion (FACE, the Act Against Exclusion Foundation). In 1995, Pierre Mauroy named her as the first deputy to the Mayor of Lille, thus giving her a foothold in the department of Nord.
Lionel Jospin, who became the socialist candidate as French President in 1995, made her his campaign spokesman during the presidential campaign. Upon his defeat, Jospin became first secretary of the Socialist Party, and offered her the number two spot, which Aubry refused.
Aubry had good relations with part of the establishment, especially with her former Pechiney boss, Jean Gandois, and the Parti communiste francais. But she did not get on well with the unions, in particular with Nicole Notat, the former General Secretary of the CFDTAubry has been described as hard and demanding. She counters, ""Je dis les choses en face, je ne suis pas faux-cul. Mais je crois être bien moins dure que beaucoup de gens en politique. Je suis même peut-être trop sensible. (I'm up-front, and I'm not a hypocrite. But I think I'm much less hard than many politicians. I may even be too sensitive.) ""


=== Minister of Employment and Solidarity: 1997–2000 ===

Elected as a member of the National Assembly, Aubry was appointed in 1997 as Minister of Employment and Solidarity, the most important minister after the Prime Minister. The same year, to fight unemployment, she created a new employment contract for young people (Emplois-jeunes) with financial help from the government. In 1998, a law establishing the 35-hour workweek was adopted.
In 1999, the Couverture maladie universelle (CMU), a program that reimburses medical expenses through social security for everyone, was voted through. Furthermore, for people on low incomes, the CMU offers complementary health coverage of 100%, which is added to standard Social Security payments; this avoids the necessity for additional private (top-up) insurance.


=== 2012 Presidential candidacy ===

On 28 June 2011, Aubry said in a televised address from the former train station of Lille-Saint-Sauveur : ""I have decided to propose my candidacy to the presidential election"".Following the first round of the citizens primary, she faced François Hollande in the second round of voting on 16 October in a two-way runoff. In the final round of voting, Hollande won the nomination with 56.6% of the vote.
After Aubry's defeat in the primaries, she became one of the main supporters of the Francois Hollande presidential campaign. Aubry's name had been mentioned as a potential prime minister for François Hollande. But, after Hollande was elected President, he chose Jean-Marc Ayrault as Prime Minister; Aubry refused to join his cabinet.


=== From 2014: statements of divergence ===
On several occasions, Aubry expressed criticism of the Manuel Valls government, including the fact that he was chosen. In October 2014, she asked for a reorientation of the economic policy.During a press conference held on 23 September 2015, where Aubry confirmed the choice of Pierre de Saintignon as the head of list for the next coming Regional Elections, she said that the bad polls of the list are partly caused by some choices of the government. She was criticising Emmanuel Macron, Minister of Economy since 2014, saying: ""Macron? How to tell it... The cup is full.""Ahead of the Socialist Party's 2017 primaries, Aubry publicly endorsed Benoît Hamon as the party's candidate for the presidential election later that year.
