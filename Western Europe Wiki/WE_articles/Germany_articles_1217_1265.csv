0,"Andrea Voßhoff is a German former lawyer who switched to full-time politics in mid-career (CDU).   She served as a member of the Bundestag between 1998 and 2013 when, as a ""party list"" candidate, she narrowly failed to secure re-election in the Brandenburg-Potsam electoral district.At the end of 2013 it was announced that she had been appointed to serve as Germany's data protection commissioner in succession to Peter Schaar, with effect from 6 January 2014.   The appointment drew widespread criticism from those who saw it as a consolation prize for a politician who had served her party loyally in the Bundestag for fifteen years.   Opponents pointed to a parliamentary voting record that showed no great affection for the right to personal privacy.   She had, indeed, supported a number of controversial proposals and pieces of government legislation in respect of matters such as data retention, online data access involving (in particular) child abuse, government access to citizen's computers using undisclosed spying software and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.   She nevertheless served out a full five-year term as national data protection commissioner:  while the criticism was not completely stilled, notably in respect of her alleged failure to give data protection issues a more prominent public profile, there were those who paid tribute to a succession of robust and legally sound data protection judgements handed down during her incumbency, and the expansion of the data-protection office under her watch.


== Life and career ==


=== Provenance and early years ===
Andrea Astrid Voßhoff was born into a family of waterways workers in the little town of Haren in northern Germany, close to the Dutch border.   The area in which she was born was traditionally Protestant, but slightly more than a decade before her birth, through a combination of industrial scale ethnic cleansing and various local factors, the region had, like much of western Germany, become more evenly balanced in respect of the Protestant-Catholic mix.   Andrea Voßhoff herself is registered as a Roman Catholic.She attended secondary school in Meppen, passing the ""Abitur"" (school final exams) in 1977, which opened the way to university-level education.   Between 1977 and 1979 she studied Jurisprudence at the University of Münster.   This was followed by a year as a foreign (non-Swiss) student at the University of Lausanne.   After that she went on to work as a lawyer, initially as a trainee and later as a notary.   She passed her Level 1 and Level 2 national law exams in 1984 and 1987.   She was now qualified to work as a fully qualified lawyer in her own practice, which she did between 1988 and 1991.By 1991 she had acquired a husband.   That year the two of them relocated to Rathenow, a small town a short distance to the west of Berlin.   Peter-Michael Voßhoff also has a legal background.   In Rathenow he opened a Notary's office.   Andrea Voßhoff was employed as his office manager between 1991 and 1998.   The marriage remained childless.


=== CDU ===
Andrea Voßhoff had been not quite 30 in 1986, when she joined a political party.   She joined the centre-right ""Christian Democratic Union"" (CDU) which at that time, under the leadership of Dr. Helmut Kohl, was the larger of the two parties sharing power in Germany's governing coalition.   Between 1997 and 2007 she served as deputy chair for the local party in Havelland.   Between 1999 and 2005 she was also deputy CDU party chair in the entire state of Brandenburg, which had been reinstated in October 1990 as part of the overall reunification process.Between 1996 and 2000 she was, in addition, chair of the Brandenburg section of the party's ""Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsunion"" (MIT), a highly influential organisation representing the interests of ""Mittelstand"" entrepreneurs, the self-employed and freelancers within the party, dedicated both to eulogising the free-market liberalism attributed to the ""Wirtschaftswunder chancellor"", Ludwig Erhard, and to advancing the current agenda of members within the party.


=== Stadtverordnetenversammlung ===
Between 2003 and 2013 Andrea Voßhoff was a member of the ""Stadtverordnetenversammlung"" (town council) of Rathenow.   She was a member of the council committee for finance and budgeting which, from November 2003, she chaired.   Between 2008 and 2010 she was also a member of the Havelland district council.


=== Bundestag (National Parliament) ===
In 1998 Andrea Voßhoff was elected for the first time to the Bundestag (the directly elected ""lower"" house of Germany's bicameral parliament) as a member for electoral district 275, corresponding to a region in the western part of the state of Brandenburg.   The party put her name forward for direct election: she was also included as a list candidate, in position 2 on the party's list for the state of Brandenburg.   Electoral district 275 was traditionally one in which the SPD candidate tended to come first, and it was only as a list candidate that Voßhoff secured her own election.   As a Bundestag member, she was appointed by the party to serve on the Bundestag Law Committee between 1998 and 2013.   On 20 April 2010 the party leadership in the Bundestag appointed Voßhoff to serve as party spokesperson on legal matters and chair of the party's ""Law Working Group"".   She was also one of the twelve members of the Bundestag ""Wahlausschuss"" (Committee), which at that time was empowered to appoint directly half of the judges on Germany's Supreme Constitutionality Court.At the 2013 general election Voßhoff fell victim, at least in part, to her party's electoral success.   As before, she stood for election in the Brandenburg-Potsam electoral district both as a direct candidate and as a list candidate.   As in 2009, her SPD opponent for direct election was Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a locally popular centrist member of his party with a longstanding national profile as a former (and, as matters turned out, future) German Minister for Foreign Affairs.   Although Steinmeier's winning margin was a narrow one, reflecting national trends, he nevertheless outpolled Voßhoff.   Elsewhere in the Brandenburg, there were so many  CDU candidates who secured direct election to the Bundestag, that the appropriate vote share was already achieved without the need for recourse to any CDU list candidate.  As the candidate at the top of the CDU party list for Brandenburg, Voßhoff retained the status of ""first-reserve"" candidate, but in September 2013, after the calculations had been completed, there was no longer a Bundestag seat allocated to her.   The situation was one which had not been anticipated.


=== Commissioner for Data Protection and Information Freedom ===
On 19 December 2013 a Bundestag vote confirmed Andrea Voßhoff's appointment as Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in succession to Peter Schaar whose retirement had taken effect, formally, three days earlier, following a ten-year incumbency.   Voßhoff was installed in her new role by Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière on 4 February 2014.The appointment was criticised by the powerful (in Germany) data protection lobby.   As a member of the Bundestag between 1998 and 2013 Voßhoff had voted in support of several contentious pieces of government legislation in respect of matters such as data retention, online data access involving (in particular) child abuse, government access to citizen's computers using undisclosed spying software and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.   More generally ventilated was a suspicion that Voßhoff had been given the job as a consolation prize following her unexpected failure to secure re-election to the Bundestag because of an unforeseen quirk in the psephological arithmetic.   At the end of her first 100 days in post the media verdict was, on balance, negative.   Writing a little more than nine months after her installation, Constanze Kurz, on behalf of the Chaos Computer Club, was already prepared to describe Voßhoff's first year in office as ""a disaster"". In a new era of mass-surveillance the Data Protection Commissioner was, for the most part, nowhere to be seen.   Such interventions as she had made were timid bordering on apologetic.In 2016 Andre Meister felt able to provide a less one-sided assessment:  ""This critique [which the Data Protection Protectioner had just authored, and which had then been leaked] could hardly be clearer. The otherwise rather insipid Andrea Voßhoff gives the intelligence services and the chancellry one legal ear-bashing after another"".  Two years after that, however, reflecting on the ending of Voßhoff's five year term, Kurz remained robustly unimpressed: ""Data Protection and Information Freedom both require a return to a much stronger public profile"".Critics and supporters alike could agree on the way in which data protection challenges grew during the first part of the twenty-first century. In the course of Voßhoff's five year incumbency the number of people working at the Data Protection Commisariat more than doubled.Between 2014 and 2018 Voßhoff was a member of the German government's - thus far largely inconsequential -  Data Ethics Commission.Voßhoff's term as data protection commissioner ended at the beginning of 2019. In a review of Voßhoff's term, Constanze Kurz renewed her criticism on netzpolitik.org, attesting to the outgoing federal data protection commissioner's lack of visibility in public debates, even though events relevant to data protection law, such as the entry into force of the DSGVO or the controversy over the state Trojan, fell during Voßhoff's term. His successor is SPD politician Ulrich Kelber.

1,"Sahra Wagenknecht (born Sarah Wagenknecht; German: [ˌzaːʁa ˈvaːɡŋ̍ˌknɛçt]; 16 July 1969) is a German politician, economist, author, and publicist. Since 2009 she has been a member of the Bundestag, where until 2023 she represented The Left. From 2015 to 2019, she served as that party's parliamentary co-chair. With a small team of allies, she left the party on 23 October 2023 to found her own party in 2024, Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht, to contest elections onwards.Wagenknecht became a prominent member of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) from the early 1990s. After the foundation of The Left, she became a leading member of one of the party's most left-wing factions as leader of the Communist Platform. She has been a controversial figure throughout her career due to her hardline and populist stances, statements about East Germany, immigration and refugees (which moved away from traditional antiracism), and her political movement Aufstehen. From 2020 onward Wagenknecht was less active in parliament, but often interviewed by German media. She is not a member of any parliamentary committee.Since 2021 she has openly considered forming her own party, due to growing and enduring conflicts within the Left Party and at the end of September 2023 she formed BSW – Reason and Justice political party in 2024.


== Early life ==
Wagenknecht was born on 16 July 1969 in the East German city of Jena. Her father is Iranian and her mother, who worked for a state-run art distributor, is German. Her father disappeared in Iran when she was a child. She was cared for primarily by her grandparents until 1976, when she and her mother moved to East Berlin. While in Berlin, she became a member of the Free German Youth (FDJ). She completed her Abitur exams in 1988 and joined the (then ruling) Socialist Unity Party (SED) in early 1989.From 1990, Wagenknecht studied philosophy and New German Literature as an undergraduate in Jena and Berlin, completing mandatory coursework, but did not write a thesis as she ""could not find support for her research aims at the East Berlin Humboldt University"". She then enrolled as a philosophy student at the University of Groningen, completing her studies and earning an MA in 1996 for a thesis on the young Karl Marx's interpretation of Hegel, supervised by Hans Heinz Holz and published as a book in 1997. From 2005 until 2012 she completed a PhD dissertation at the chair of Microeconomics at TU Chemnitz, on ""The Limits of Choice: Saving Decisions and Basic Needs in Developed Countries"", awarded with the grade magna cum laude in the German system and subsequently published by the Campus Verlag.


== Political career ==
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the transformation of the SED into the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), Wagenknecht was elected to the new party's National Committee in 1991. She also joined the PDS's Communist Platform, a Marxist-Leninist faction.In the 1998 German federal election, Wagenknecht ran as the PDS candidate in a district of Dortmund, garnering 3.25% of the vote. Following the 2004 European elections, she was elected as a PDS representative to the European Parliament. Among her duties in the parliament were serving on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Delegation, as well as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly.Following the merger of the PDS and the WASG that formed the Left Party (Die Linke), Wagenknecht considered campaigning for the position of party vice-chair. However, party leaders such as Lothar Bisky and Gregor Gysi objected to the idea primarily because of her perceived sympathies for the former German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany). Following the controversy, she announced that she would not run for the post. Wagenknecht successfully contested a seat in the 2009 federal election in North Rhine-Westphalia. She became the Left Party's spokesperson for economic politics in the Bundestag. On 15 May 2010, she was at last elected vice president of the Left Party with 75.3% of the vote.
Early in 2012, the German press reported that Wagenknecht was one of 27 Left Party Bundestag members whose writings and speeches were being collected and analyzed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.She has been one of the main driving forces in the formation of Aufstehen, a left-wing political movement established in 2018, which exists outside of traditional political party structures and has been compared to the French movement La France Insoumise. In March 2019, Wagenknecht announced her withdrawal from her leadership role within Aufstehen, citing personal workload pressures and insisting that after a successful start-up phase, for which political experience was necessary, the time had come for the movement's own grass roots to assume control. She complained that the involvement of political parties at its heart had ""walled in"" the movement. She would nonetheless continue to make public appearances on its behalf.Wagenknecht was elected co-leader of the Left's Bundestag group in 2015 alongside Dietmar Bartsch succeeding long-time leader Gregor Gysi. Wagenknecht won 78.4% of votes cast. As the Left was at the time the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, she became a prominent leader of the opposition for the remainder of the parliamentary term. Bartsch and Wagenknecht were the Left's lead candidates for the 2017 federal election.The biography Sahra Wagenknecht. Die Biografie by Christian Schneider was published in 2019 and focuses on Wagenknecht as a person, including her family background and interest in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In November 2019, she announced her resignation as parliamentary leader, citing burnout. Her activities from 2017 to 2019, culminating with her resignation, are covered in the 2020 documentary film Wagenknecht, directed by Sandra Kaudelka.Wagenknecht was again nominated as the lead candidate on the party's North Rhine-Westphalia list in the 2021 federal election. She was re-elected, but described the results as a ""bitter defeat"" for her party.


=== Secession from Die Linke ===

Due to the growing conflicts within Die Linke, Wagenknecht has been considering forming her own party. There was speculation since 2021 that her faction and other like-minded groups within Die Linke, such as the Socialist Left or the Karl Liebknecht circles, will break off to form a separate party. Policy-wise, the new party was expected to follow a left-nationalist strategy.
At the end of September, people from Wagenknecht's circle founded the association ""BSW – For Reason and Justice e. V."". According to the news magazine Der Spiegel, the abbreviation in the club's name stands for ""Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht"" (""Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance""). The association is intended to serve as a precursor to a future party.In mid-October, over 50 members of Die Linke submitted an application for Wagenknecht's exclusion from the party. The initiators said they wanted to prevent Sahra Wagenknecht from building a new party with the resources of Die Linke. ""This is no longer acceptable,"" said Sofia Leonidakis, leader of Die Linke in the Bremen parliament. The ongoing speculation about the founding of a new party and the resulting breakup of Die Linke also put a strain on the election campaigns in Bavaria and Hesse. Die Linke failed to enter both state parliaments.In January 2024, her new party was officially launched.


== Political views ==


=== Economic policy ===
Wagenknecht has argued that the Left Party must pursue radical and anti-capitalist goals, thereby remaining distinct from the more moderate Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Green Party. She has criticized the Left Party's participation in coalition governments, especially the Berlin state government, which has made cuts to social spending and privatized some services.On 14 February 2014, the German business and economics newspaper Handelsblatt put her on the cover of its weekend edition, wondering: ""Are the Left the better at understanding economics?"" (Sind die Linken die besseren Wirtschaftsversteher?) The ambiguous headline made it unclear whether the question referred to left-wingers in general or to Wagenknecht's party, The Left, in particular. The newspaper had earlier interviewed her about her ideas about liberalism and socialism.Ahead of the launch of BSW in October 2023, Tagesschau noted that Wagenknecht's modern positions emphasise ""economic reason"" and place economic fundamentals before social welfare, comparing her stance to that of the conservative CDU and FDP. In an interview, she described her goals as combating inflation, encouraging small and medium enterprise and domestic technology development, and establishing stable trade with a wide range of partners. She previously rejected accusations that she sought to establish control bodies for various industries, and cited as inspiration the ideas of economist Mariana Mazzucato, who is also considered a source for economics minister Robert Habeck, whom Wagenknecht frequently criticises.


=== Foreign policy ===
In 2017, Wagenknecht called for the dissolution of NATO and for a new security agreement that links Germany and Russia. Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia. In 1992, she had published an essay praising Stalinist Russia, a view she said in 2017 she no longer espoused.Wagenknecht has expressed strong support for the rise of left-wing leaders in Latin America, such as Hugo Chávez, and for SYRIZA's 2015 electoral victory in Greece. She serves as a spokesperson for the Venezuela Avanza solidarity network, and as an alternate on the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Mercosur.In 2010, she refused to join a standing ovation when former Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel Laureate Shimon Peres gave a speech in the Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day.


==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Wagenknecht was a prominent defender of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, arguing that while the United States were trying to ""conjure up"" an invasion of Ukraine, ""Russia has in fact no interest in marching into Ukraine"". After Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Wagenknecht said that her judgment had been wrong. 
Wagenknecht opposed sanctions against Russia over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and, in a speech in September 2022, accused the German government of ""launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier"". Before the war, over half of Germany's gas was supplied by Russia. In May, The Left had voted in favor of economic sanctions against Russia. Her speech was applauded by The Left party leadership and by the far-right Alternative for Germany. Her speech prompted the resignation of two high-profile party members.On February 10, 2023, Wagenknecht and Alice Schwarzer started collecting signatures for their Manifest für Frieden (lit. 'Manifesto for peace') on Change.org. It called for negotiations with Russia and a halt to arms deliveries to Ukraine. By the end of the month it had received 700,000 signatures. A rally for peace with Wagenknecht and Schwarzer on February 25 was also attended by far-right groups, and was said to have appealed to the Querfront.


=== Refugee policy ===
In response to the 2015 Cologne sexual attacks, Wagenknecht stated ""Whoever abuses his right to hospitality has forfeited his right to hospitality"". This statement was almost unanimously criticized in her party and parliamentary group colleagues, but did receive praise from some in the AfD.On May 28 2016, an activist from the anti-fascist group Torten für Menschenfeinde (""Cakes for Enemies of Humanity"") pushed a chocolate cake in Wagenknecht's face at a Left Party meeting in Magdeburg in response to Wagenknecht's calls for limits on the number of refugees. Wagenknecht has criticized Angela Merkel's refugee policies, arguing that her government has not provided the levels of financial and infrastructural support required to avoid increasing pressure on local authorities and the labor market, thereby exacerbating tensions in society. She has also claimed that Merkel's policies were partly to blame for the 2016 Berlin truck attack.Partly in response to these experiences, in 2021, she published the book Die Selbstgerechten (""The Self-Righteous"") in which she criticizes so-called ""left-liberals"" (""Linksliberale"") for being neither left nor liberal but rather supporting the ruling classes, and, to some extent, their own interests. The book features, among several other topics, a discussion on immigration's alleged negative impacts on the domestic working class. It reached number one in the German non-fiction bestseller list as published by Der Spiegel.


=== Family policy ===
At the beginning of June 2015, Wagenknecht, together with 150 other celebrities from culture and politics, signed an open letter to the Chancellor calling for same-sex civil partnerships to be given equal treatment to opposite-sex marriage. In 2017, Wagenknecht advocated for legalization of same-sex marriage.


=== COVID-19 ===
Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Wagenknecht has opined that only the elderly and vulnerable groups need to be vaccinated against the disease, and agitated against the German government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wagenknecht has opposed proposals for COVID-19 vaccine mandates, arguing they should be a personal choice.Wagenknecht's positions have been compared to those of the far-right Alternative for Germany. In November 2021, party colleagues such as Maximilian Becker, Martina Renner, and Niema Movassat suggested that Wagenknecht leave the party.


== Personal life ==
Wagenknecht married businessman Ralph-Thomas Niemeyer in May 1997. On 12 November 2011, politician Oskar Lafontaine stated publicly that he and Wagenknecht had become ""close friends"". At the time, Wagenknecht and Lafontaine had already separated from their respective spouses. Wagenknecht married Lafontaine, 26 years her senior, on 22 December 2014. She is an atheist.In 2023, the media estimated Wagenknecht's assets at three million euros. In addition to her parliamentary remuneration, Sahra Wagenknecht earned around 750,000 euros in book and speaking fees in 2023. She is one of the German politicians with the highest earnings in the Bundestag and a millionaire.

10,"Christel Wegner (born 16 November 1947 in Hamburg) is a German Communist politician.  In 2008, she was elected to the assembly of Lower Saxony for Die Linke, although she is a member of the German Communist Party (DKP), which until now has cooperated closely with that party. Shortly after her election, she gained widespread attention when it was claimed by a TV program that she had called for the return of the Stasi and justified the construction of the Berlin Wall, also voicing her support for Margot Honecker. The Left party distanced itself from her, and on 18 February 2008 she was expelled from The Left Party parliamentary group.


== Controversial statements ==
Wegner gained widespread attention after she made controversial statements during a television interview in February 2008 with the NDR. She said ""I believe that, when one creates another kind of society, one will need such a structure again, because one has to protect oneself against other forces, reactionary forces who use the opportunity and weaken such a state from the inside."" The program suggested that ""such a structure"" referred to the GDR Secret Police organisation the Stasi.In reply, in a personal statement, Wegner declared: ""What I really said was that every state has a secret service and that this is of course also the case for a socialist state"" and that she did not in fact ""want the Stasi back"".The DKP politician also declared that a reason for the construction of the Berlin Wall was to keep West Germans out of the GDR, ""both to prevent them from hurting the economy by buying goods cheaply and also to keep out forces one didn't want there."" Also, she stated her ""unconditional support"" for those who ""spent their entire lives building up another kind of society"" and that she supported Margot Honecker ""idealistically and materially"".In her statement she declared that ""It really is clear that I'm not out to restart the Stasi, to rebuild the Berlin Wall or to take away the homes of the citizens of Lower Saxony."" Claiming that there were many cuts in the report and that ""The goal of the campaign clearly is to hit Die Linke, and of course also me as a Communist.""The TV program upheld its earlier claims that she was indeed making references to the Stasi and that during the interview she made repetitive claims stating that the Stasi was ""legitimate for the GDR"".


== Expulsion from The Left parliamentary group ==
On 18 February 2008 the Die Linke Lower Saxony parliamentary group issued a statement saying that she had been expelled from their parliamentary group and urged her to give up her seat in the assembly.

She was elected to the federal executive committee of the AfD in June 2015. In April 2017 she was elected co-Lead Candidate of the party. She is the first lesbian woman to serve as a lead candidate of her party. She has been identified by the media as belonging to the more moderate conservative Alternative Mitte faction within the AfD.


=== AfD donation scandal ===

The Switzerland-based property billionaire Henning Conle supported AfD. He donated a total of 132,000 euros by means of straw men for the 2017 federal election campaign of Alice Weidel. Conle disguised his donation from Switzerland in 18 tranches.The AfD had to pay the Bundestag a high fine for this donation, but Weidel and three other officials went unpunished.


== Political positions ==


=== Religion ===
At the end of 2017, Weidel accused the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany of ""playing the same inglorious role that they played in the Third Reich"", accusing both churches of being ""thoroughly politicized"" and stating that AfD is ""the only Christian party that still exists"" in Germany. Such statements were dismissed by the Catholic German Bishops' Conference and the Evangelical Church as ""polemics"" and ""derailment"".


=== Immigration ===
Weidel has criticized the immigration policies of Angela Merkel, stating that ""the country will be destroyed through this immigration policy. Donald Trump said that Merkel is insane and I absolutely agree with that. It is a completely nonsensical form of politics that is being followed here."" She has called for the German government to invest in ""special economic zones"" in the Middle East to encourage educated and skilled persons to remain in their home countries and avoid the possibility of brain drain, but also says she supports a ""Canadian-style system"" which would privilege skilled, over unskilled, immigrants.


=== European Union ===
Weidel supports continued German membership in the European Union; however, she has called for economically weak states, such as Greece, to leave. Despite her stance on German membership of the EU, she believes that Germany should withdraw from the Eurozone.

=== Environment ===
She has expressed doubts about global warming.


== Controversies ==


=== TV show ""political correctness"" incident ===
In April 2017, Weidel railed against political correctness, claiming that it belonged in the ""dustbin of history"". In response, on 27 April, TV presenter Christian Ehring of the satire program extra 3 addressed this, saying ""That's right! Let's put an end to political correctness. The Nazi slut is right. Was this incorrect enough? I hope so!"" Weidel sued the channel seeking to forbid re-airing of the program, and on 17 May the Hamburg District Court ruled against her, stating that a public figure must tolerate exaggerated criticism. Weidel disagreed with the decision and promised to bring it to the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court). As of September 2017, no further action had taken place.


=== Illegal immigration incident ===
A September 2017 report by Die Zeit claimed that Weidel had illegally hired a Syrian refugee to do housework at her home in Switzerland. The report also alleged that the asylum seeker did not have a written work contract, nor were there invoices for her work. Weidel responded in a tweet that the Die Zeit report was ""fake news"" and ""false"" and Weidel's lawyer stated that Weidel had a Syrian stay at her home as a guest but not as a worker.


=== Border revisionism ===
In June 2023, Weidel commented on the election polls results in former East Germany, stating that AfD has a great support in this region. However, she referred to the region as Mitteldeutschland (central Germany), suggesting that the so-called Recovered Territories are part of Germany, which caused controversies among the Polish politicians.


=== Potsdam meeting incident ===
In January 2024, it emerged that Roland Hartwig - who had been appointed as an advisor to Weidel - attended a controversial meeting with German far-right activists in which plans to deport millions of people living in Germany, including some with German citizenship, were presented and discussed. In the wake of this, Weidel fired Hartwig as her advisor.

=== Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development, 1998–2009 ===
First term
When Gerhard Schröder (SPD) became Chancellor following the 1998 elections, Wieczorek-Zeul was appointed Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the time, her appointment was seen as underlining the importance attached to the issue by the Social Democrat/Green government.In her capacity as minister, Wieczorek-Zeul served as Member of the Broadcasting Board of Deutsche Welle; as Member of Board of Supervisory Directors of KfW; and as Member of the Board of Governors of the World Bank. She also participated in the preparations for the 25th G8 summit in 1999 and the 33rd G8 summit in 2007, both of which were hosted by Germany. In her first years in office, she worked merged the 'Deutsche Stiftung für internationale Entwicklung (DSE)' and the 'Carl-Duisberg-Gesellschaft (CDG)' to create InWEnt, an institution with worldwide operations in the field of bilateral development cooperation and international cooperation, with a focus on capacity building.
During a meeting at Utstein Abbey on the west coast of Norway in 1999, Wieczorek-Zeul co-founded (along with fellow development ministers Eveline Herfkens, Clare Short and Hilde Frafjord Johnson) the Utstein Group, a partnership of donor countries working to make the UN development system more effective.In an effort to make it easier for antiwar critics to back Schröder’s decision to send German Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in 2001, Wieczorek-Zeul and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer announced a 256 million marks ($115 million) humanitarian-aid package for Afghan refugees. In October 2001, she joined Schröder on a state visit to Pakistan for meetings with President Pervez Musharraf, where they revived economic assistance to the country in return for its support for the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism and in light of incoming refugee flows from Afghanistan. In 2004, she co-hosted an international donors' conference on Afghanistan in Berlin, during which Afghanistan received more than $8 billion in pledges for the years 2005 to 2007. By 2007, she called extension for the international armed forces in the country.In February 2003, Wieczorek-Zeul was one out of three cabinet members taking part in a march against the Iraq War in Berlin.On 16 August 2004, at the 100th anniversary of the start of the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, Wieczorek-Zeul, on behalf of the German government, officially apologized for the first time and expressed grief about the genocide, declaring, ""We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time."" In addition, she admitted that the massacres were equivalent to genocide. She ruled out paying special compensation, but promised continued economic aid for Namibia.Wieczorek-Zeul represented the German government at the funeral services for former Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of Japan on 8 June 2000 and (alongside Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer) for Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić of Serbia on 16 March 2003.Second term
Wieczorek-Zeul kept her office after Schröder's defeat in the 2005 elections and served in the first government Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2005 until 2009.
Wieczorek-Zeul initiated the EU's target of increasing its official development assistance (ODA) from 0.51 percent by 2010 to 0.7 percent of the GDP by 2015. During her time in office, German ODA increased regularly and reached 13.9 billion US$ in disbursements in 2008, taking it to 0.38 percent of GNI.In October 2007, Wieczorek-Zeul joined Merkel on her first official trip to Africa – including stops in Ethiopia, Liberia and South Africa –, during which they met with Nelson Mandela and Graça Machel, John Kufuor and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, among others. She also visited Kenya's sprawling slum at Mathare 4A, Kasarani District and virtually pitied Mathare 4A primary school, which had been invaded and harassed by squatters. Today, the old school has been replaced by a new Heidemarie (formally, Mathare 4A) Primary School, courtesy of the German Government through KfW Entwicklungsbank and the government of Kenya.
On 26 January 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul and Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel chaired the conference which led to the founding of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).Under her leadership, Germany joined Austria and Switzerland in July 2009 in canceling 450 million euros ($630 million) in state export-loan guarantees for Turkey’s Ilısu Dam because Turkish plans to resettle towns and safeguard cultural treasures were not sufficient to meet World Bank standards.Wieczorek-Zeul also served on the Executive Board of the Socialist International (SI).

Amid a 2007 leadership crisis at the Bank, Wieczorek-Zeul was a leading figure in the downfall of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the organization. At the time, Germany’s role was central partly because it held the EU presidency and also chaired the bank’s 24-nation Executive Board. Wolfowitz was later replaced by Robert Zoellick.Alongside Chancellor Merkel, Wieczorek-Zeul co-hosted the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria replenishment conference in Berlin in September 2007. During the conference, donor countries promised nearly $10 billion to the Fund for 2008-2010.In 2008, Wieczorek-Zeul served as Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the International Conference on Financing for Development in Doha, Qatar. Between 2008 and 2009, she was part of a High-Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, which had been launched to help strengthen health systems in the 49 poorest countries in the world and was chaired by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Robert Zoellick.Also between 2008 and 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul served as member of the Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, which was chaired by author and Nobel Laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz. The commission had the aim of proposing necessary reforms in the world financial system that would prevent another event like the late-2000s financial crisis.

She was elected in the first ballot with 319 votes (57.5%), but was challenged by several candidates, including Heidi Reichinnek, who won 199 votes (35.8%).


== Political positions ==
Wissler is considered a member of her party's left wing. She rejects capitalism as an ""inhuman, cruel system"". She has stated that a classless society cannot be achieved through parliaments or governments, and that historical progress has always been achieved through revolution.Wissler advocates the Germany's withdrawal from NATO and the alliance's dissolution. She opposes all military missions abroad, including those under a United Nations mandate, stating: ""There are no 'humanitarian interventions'. Wars are never fought out of charity, but out of economic and political interests."" She supports raising taxes on the rich to provide greater funding for public services. When asked what she believed the world would look like in fifty years, she stated: ""I wish for a world in which the pursuit of profit does not come first and in which all people can live in peace and social security. If the enormous wealth that exists in the world were distributed fairly, no one would have to live in poverty. But to do that, you have to fundamentally change the balance of power and ownership.""In 2020, she stated that her party must stand up for justice, ecology, and peace at home and abroad, acting as a force that ""supports concrete struggles and represents an anti-capitalist perspective"".


== Assessment ==
Wissler was aged 26 upon her election to the Landtag, and quickly attracted a high profile for her rapid advancement at a young age, as well as her controversial positions. She was portrayed as a contrast to then-Minister-President of Hesse Roland Koch, a noted conservative from the right wing of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). At this time, Oskar Lafontaine recognised her as a great political talent.Wissler is considered a pragmatic and effective parliamentarian. She was a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to form a red–red–green coalition (R2G) government in Hesse after the 2008 election. As co-leader of her party's parliamentary group in Hesse, she was described as reliable and conciliatory, able to work constructively across party lines. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that deputies from other parties preferred to work with her than her counterpart van Ooyen. The publication described Wissler's speeches as among the most pointed of any deputy, and that ""she uses all the instruments that parliament has to offer with great virtuosity"". Within her party, she is well-connected in both the western and eastern states.


== Controversy ==
Wissler's high profile and radical positions have attracted criticism. The Hessian CDU described her statements about parliamentarism and revolution as ""particularly worrying"" and evidence of the ""partially anti-constitutional"" nature of her party, claiming they represent its ""turning away from parliamentary democracy"". Her election as co-Landtag leader was received with some controversy within her own party due to her association with Marx21 (formerly Linksruck), which is recognised by the Bundesverfassungsschutz as an extremist group.Wissler was accused of ""falsifying history"" by members of the Social Democratic Party after claiming that Social Democrats were responsible for the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.At demonstrations against the opening of the Seat of the European Central Bank on 18 March 2015, Wissler worked as a parliamentary observer and accompanied the Italian rainbow group. According to the police, this group was responsible for riots in the city centre. Wissler subsequently condemned such behaviour, stating: ""That is definitely not what it should be about. We wanted a peaceful protest against the ECB.""


=== Sexual abuse in The Left ===
Wissler was subject to scrutiny in 2022 after reports emerged of sexual abuse in the Hessian branch of The Left. In particular, she was accused of covering up alleged abuse committed in 2018 by her then-partner against an underage party member. Wissler claimed that she only learned about an affair between her partner and the alleged victim after the latter turned 18, and that she had heard no claims of abuse at the time. In April, the Wiesbaden public prosecutor stated that charges had been raised and subsequently dropped in three cases of abuse relating to the Hessian Left, with one case instead being pursued via a private suit.

Biography at the German Bundestag"
35,"Andrea Ypsilanti (née Dill; born 8 April 1957) is a German politician.


== Political career ==
Ypsilanti was a member of the Hessian Landtag (parliament) and served as chairperson of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Hesse from March 2003 to January 2009.
In the Hesse state elections of 2008, held on 27 January 2008, she was the SPD's candidate for the position of minister-president (Ministerpräsident), or prime minister, of Hesse. In that election, her party received 36.7 per cent of the vote - only 0.1 per cent less than the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of incumbent Roland Koch, which had ruled the state since 1999. Thus, the Hesse SPD came in second, but gained the same number of representatives in the Landtag as the CDU. Overall, the 2008 election led to a deadlock in the state parliament, because neither the CDU and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), nor the SPD and the Green Party, had enough seats to constitute a parliamentary majority, thus enabling the formation of a coalition government. The reason for this was that the Die Linke had entered the Landtag for the first time ever with 5.3% of the vote. Hessian constitution allows for continued operation of the previous government in case of a hung parliament.
Before the 2008 election, Ypsilanti had promised on many occasions to never work together with the Left Party. However, after a ""grand coalition"" with the CDU was ruled out, Ypsilanti ultimately decided to cooperate with the Left Party in order to be elected prime minister and overcome the deadlock. The first attempt was abandoned after Dagmar Metzger, one of her own party's representatives in the Landtag, declared she would not vote for Ypsilanti because of the latter's cooperation with the Left Party.
A second attempt to elect Ypsilanti prime minister was scheduled for 4 November 2008. However, one day prior to the election, three other SPD representatives - Carmen Everts, Silke Tesch, and Jürgen Walter (vice chairman of the Hesse SPD) - also announced that they would vote against her, making it impossible for Ypsilanti to gain the needed majority. This, in turn, forced the dissolution of the Landtag and the scheduling of new elections for 18 January 2009. On 8 November 2008, Ypsilanti withdrew her candidacy in favor of Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who became the SPD's new lead candidate (Spitzenkandidat).
Preliminary election results on 18 January 2009 indicated that the CDU and the (FDP) together won 64 seats in the parliament - five more than the 59 required - and thus could begin forming a governing coalition. At the same time the SPD lost 13 per cent of the vote compared to the previous election, falling to an historic low in Hesse and one of the worst showings by the party in a German state election. After the preliminary results were published, Ypsilanti announced her resignation as party chairperson.
In February 2010, Ypsilanti, together with Sven Giegold of the Green Party, Katja Kipping of the Left Party, and others, founded the Institut Solidarische Moderne, a left-wing think tank opposed to neoliberalism.


== Personal life ==
Ypsilanti grew up in Rüsselsheim as the daughter of a worker at the local Opel factory. After finishing school she worked as a secretary and then as a flight attendant for Lufthansa. From 1986 until 1992 she studied sociology, political science and education in Frankfurt, graduating with a master's in sociology. She wrote her thesis on the theme ""Women and Power"". After her divorce in 1992 she kept her Greek husband's last name Ypsilanti. She lives with her partner in Frankfurt.

37,"Helga Zepp-LaRouche (born 25 August 1948) is a German political activist. She is the widow of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche, and the founder of the LaRouche movement's Schiller Institute, as well as the German Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität party (BüSo) (Civil Rights Movement Solidarity).
She has run for political office several times in Germany, representing small parties founded by the LaRouche movement, but has never been elected. She is the editor of Das Hitler-Buch (1984), published by the Schiller Institute, a collection of historical investigations into the origins of Nazism.


== Biography ==
Lyndon LaRouche wrote in The Power of Reason (first edition) that his wife was an orphan. According to the Schiller Institute and Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität websites, she left high school in 1968 to work as an unpaid journalist in Hamburg and Hannover, later becoming a freelancer. In 1971, the websites continue, she traveled through China as one of the first European journalists there, just after the highpoint of the Cultural Revolution. When she returned to Germany, she studied political science, history and philosophy at the Otto Suhr Institute of the Free University of Berlin and at Frankfurt am Main.On 29 December 1977, Helga Zepp and Lyndon LaRouche were married in Wiesbaden. According to her official biography on the Schiller Institute website, she traveled with her husband to promote his proposals for monetary reform and large-scale infrastructural development, and met with former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and former Mexican president José López Portillo. She returned to Mexico in 1998, and participated as mistress of ceremonies at a conference held at the Academy of Economics of the Mexican Society of Geography, during which Lopez Portillo greeted her once again, according to the LaRouche movement's Executive Intelligence Review. Earlier that year, Lopez Portillo, along with former Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa, former Algerian Prime Minister Abdelhamid Brahimi and other politicians, had added his signature to a call issued by Zepp-LaRouche for a ""new just world economic order.""


== Activism ==

Zepp-LaRouche is the editor of Das Hitler-Buch, published by the Schiller Institute, Campaigner Publications Deutschland, Wiesbaden 1984. ISBN 3-922734-05-7 (translated as The Hitler Book, 1984. ISBN 0-933488-37-8) She founded the Schiller Institute in the same year, saying: ""We need a movement that can finally free Germany from the control of the Versailles and Yalta treaties, thanks to which we have staggered from one catastrophe to another for an entire century.""In Dancing on My Grave (1986), ballerina Gelsey Kirkland describes her encounter with Zepp-LaRouche's ideas, as the former was battling her drug addiction: ""In spite of her extreme point of view, her unyielding radicalism, this woman provided a crucial turning point for me. Her zealous devotion to the classics and her political war against drugs emboldened me to act, yet in my own way.""She is an opponent of the clash of civilizations doctrine of Samuel P. Huntington. Following the September 11 attacks, she campaigned against the idea that there is a fundamental antagonism between U.S. and Europe on the one side, and Islam or Asian culture on the other. She has called for a ""Dialogue of Cultures"" as opposed to a ""Clash of Civilizations.""In June 2001, Zepp-LaRouche spoke before the Russian State Duma hearings on Measures to Ensure the Development of Russia's Economy under Conditions of Global Financial Destabilization. Her theme was the assertion that Wilhelm Lautenbach's program for productive employment, had it been adopted in 1931, could have ended the depression and prevented the Nazis' rise to power, and that the adoption of her husband's Eurasian Land-Bridge proposal today can avert a similar disaster. Zepp-LaRouche's presentation was later published in 2007 in the Russian magazine Forum International, in an issue devoted to the “Megaprojects of Russia’s East” conference on the Bering Strait crossing.Zepp-LaRouche has launched campaigns in various countries on other issues, including opposition to globalization and support for her husband's ""New Bretton Woods"" proposal, and a proposal to dissolve the World Trade Organization and double world food production. This latter proposal was described by the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram as ""among the notable visions, worthy of respect, which are consistent with the vision put forward by President Mubarak in Davos.""In 2012, she was a featured speaker at the 10th annual “Dialogue of Civilizations” conference in Rhodes, sponsored by the World Public Forum. She said that the accelerating collapse of the transatlantic system is driving the danger of a new world war, and that US and European liquidity expansion measures have led to a hyper-inflationary printing of money, with its “life-shortening effect” upon millions of people in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.In August 2015, Zepp-LaRouche wrote an article describing climate change as a ""Satanic swindle"". In her opinion, it ""supplies the argumentation to establish a global eco-dictatorship whose results, and whose declared intention is to eliminate six billion human beings"". Zepp-LaRouche argued that preparations are under-way for the establishment of ""a fascist world government which would exceed Hitler’s most audacious dreams"". Zepp-LaRouche suggested the origin of the ""swindle"" is the British monarchy.In July 2016, Zepp-LaRouche spoke at the first panel on the Think 20 Summit, which was organised by three Chinese academies and institutes: the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China.On 24 February 2021, Zepp-LaRouche denounced the LaRouche Political Action Committee (LPAC) and its treasurer, Barbara Boyd, for going ""in a direction which I consider contrary to the central policies that my husband stood for. [...] [S]ince he passed away in February 2019, Mrs. Boyd and her associates [...] have embarked on a path that I believe misrepresents both my and Mr. LaRouche’s positions."" and has stated that LPAC and Boyd do not represent the LaRouche movement.

44,"Brigitte Zypries (born 16 November 1953) is a German lawyer and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Between 2017 and 2018, she served as Minister for Economics and Energy in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel; she was the first woman to hold that office in German history.

== Career ==


=== Early career ===
1985–1988: Assistant head of division at State Chancellery of Hesse
1988–1990: Member of academic staff at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany
1991: Head of division of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony
1995–1997: Head of department of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony
to 1998: Active in the Ministry for Women, Labour and Social Affairs of Lower Saxony


=== State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, 1998–2002 ===
Following the 1998 federal elections, in the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Zypries became State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior under Otto Schily. From September 1999, she chaired the State Secretary Committee for the management of the Federal Government program ""Modern State – Modern Administration"".


=== Federal Minister of Justice, 2002–2009 ===
Following the 2002 federal elections, Zypries became Federal Minister of Justice in the second cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, succeeding Herta Däubler-Gmelin. Between 2007 and 2009, she was also one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state (Föderalismuskommission II), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.
In 2003, Zypries represented the German government before the Federal Constitutional Court when the Free Democratic Party challenged a German law allowing authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes. While law-enforcement officials and the government argue that the law helps fight organized crime and terrorism, opponents contend it violates constitutional privacy guarantees and has not allowed authorities to crack a single major case.In 2005, the German government suffered a major setback in its efforts to combat terrorism after the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the country's implementation of the European Arrest Warrant was unconstitutional. The court said the EU idea was compatible with Germany's constitution, but that the law drafted by Zypries was sloppily written and did not go far enough in framing the leeway offered to prosecutors by the European Arrest Warrant. Just hours after the ruling, German police released terrorism suspect Mamoun Darkazanli, who had been held awaiting extradition to Spain where he is believed to have been linked to al-Qaida activities. When German economics minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg decided to outsource the drafting of new bankruptcy legislation in 2009, Zypries criticized that Guttenberg wasted taxpayers' money and that it was the responsibility of her ministry, not his, to oversee the preparation of the legislation. In 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that a law requiring telecommunications companies to retain data from telephone, email and Internet traffic is unconstitutional; the law had been introduced by Zypries as implementation of an EU guideline.In the negotiations to form a government following the 2005 federal elections, Zypries led the SPD's delegations in the working groups on justice, consumer protection, and internal affairs; her co-chairs from the CDU/CSU were Wolfgang Bosbach, Horst Seehofer and Wolfgang Schäuble, respectively.After German prosecutors had issued arrest warrants in 2007 for 13 suspected CIA operatives believed to have been involved in the abduction of Khaled el-Masri in Macedonia in late 2003 as well as in his being taken via Baghdad to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan in January 2004, Zypries soon decided not to further pursue the CIA agents. Though their names were still on an Interpol wanted persons list, the United States stated that it would not recognize its validity. Zypries explained that the US government had made clear to her that it would neither arrest nor hand over the agents. In the end, she concluded that, given the slim chances of success, it made no sense to even try to get them extradited.On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Zypries participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008.In the case of Richard Williamson in 2009, Zypries said that the German government was willing to press charges against the bishop if he did not clearly retract his comments.In 2009, Zypries led the resistance to the Google Books Library Project in Germany. In the daily Stuttgarter Nachrichten, she accused Google of behaving in a ""simply unlawful"" way.


=== Member of Parliament, 2009–2017 ===
Between 2009 and 2013, Zypries served on the German Bundestag’s Committee on the Election of Judges (Wahlausschuss), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. From 2009, she was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG).
Ahead of the 2013 elections, Peer Steinbrück included Zypries in his shadow cabinet for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent Angela Merkel as chancellor. During the campaign, Zypries served as shadow minister for consumer protection. In the negotiations to form a so-called Grand Coalition following the elections, she led the SPD delegation in the working group on digital policy; her co-chair was Dorothee Bär of the CSU.
Following the formation of the grand coalition in December 2013, Zypries was appointed Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. In January 2014, she became the government's coordinator for aviation and space policies.
In February 2014, Zypries accompanied German President Joachim Gauck on a state visit to India – where they met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, among others – and Myanmar.In June 2016, Zypries announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.


=== Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, 2017–2018 ===
In a cabinet reshuffle following the nomination of Frank-Walter Steinmeier as candidate for the federal presidency, Zypries was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy on 27 January 2017. She succeeded Sigmar Gabriel, who took the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs from Steinmeier.
During her time in office, Zypries led the government's efforts to save Germany's then second-largest airline Air Berlin. When the company filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2017, she authorized a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations with Lufthansa continue.In the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Zypries led the working group on economic affairs, alongside Thomas Strobl and Alexander Dobrindt.


== Later career ==
From 2019 to 2023, Zypries served as ombudsperson for BDIU, the national association of Germany's credit management, debt collection and debt purchase sector. In 2020, she took on a similar role in implementing the settlement agreed between Volkswagen and the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV) following the company's emissions scandal. In 2021, she was appointed to co-chair – alongside Theo Waigel – an independent expert commission established by audit firm Ernst & Young to assess its involvement in the Wirecard scandal.Since 2023, Zypries has been serving as ombudsperson at German private credit bureau Schufa.

== Political positions ==
Zypries is considered a proponent of regulating more tightly access to Internet platforms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple Inc.’s iTunes. A joint letter to the European Commission in November 2014, signed by Zypries and her French counterpart Axelle Lemaire on behalf of the German and French governments, suggested “essential” digital platforms should potentially be brought under existing rules for telecoms markets, a standalone regulation or specially tailored antitrust rules.Zypries is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.


== Controversies ==
Ending a nasty diplomatic dispute between the United States and Germany, Zypries announced at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2006 that the German government was dropping its decades-long resistance to opening the archives kept at the International Tracing Service in the town of Bad Arolsen.On 3 June 2007, Zypries caused some controversy by saying at a meeting of G8 justice ministers in Munich that it should be assumed that missing British child Madeleine McCann was abducted by a gang that passes on children to be abused.In response to a 2007 meeting between chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama, China canceled a high-level meeting on the protection of intellectual property rights of Chinese legal experts and Zypries in retaliation. A statement from the German Justice Ministry later said the meeting was called off ""for technical reasons."" The opposition Green Party, which was in coalition with then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats from 1998 to 2005, also praised Merkel's stance.
