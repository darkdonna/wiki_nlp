12,"Annette Schavan (pronounced [aˈnɛtə ʃaˈvaːn] ; born 10 June 1955) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). She was the Federal Minister of Education and Research in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2005 to 2013, when she resigned following the revocation of her doctorate due to plagiarism. From 2014 until 2018 she served as the German Ambassador to the Holy See. From April 2018, she also briefly served as first German Ambassador to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.Throughout her political career, Schavan was widely known to be a friend and a confidante of Merkel's.


== Early life ==
Schavan was born in Jüchen on 10 June 1955.


== Political career ==


=== Career in state politics ===
From 1995 until 2005, Schavan served as State Minister of Cultural Affairs, Youth, and Sports for the German state of Baden-Württemberg in the governments of successive minister-president Erwin Teufel and Günther Oettinger. During this time, she oversaw school education in Baden-Württemberg. One controversy that erupted during this time was when a Muslim teacher was banned from wearing a head scarf in school, as that was interpreted as a religious symbol, while at the same time allowing Catholic nuns to wear their traditional habits. The argument was that the habits of nuns and monks have an official function, while a Muslim headscarf is optional.
Schavan was regarded as a possible Christian Democratic candidate for Germany's presidency in 2004, but Horst Köhler was nominated and elected instead. In 2005, she attempted to succeed Erwin Teufel as Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, but she was defeated by her rival Günther Oettinger in the internal elections of the CDU. Oettinger's referendum win – with 60.6 percent of the vote versus 39.4 percent for Schavan – was widely seen at the time as a defeat for Teufel, who had promoted Schavan as his preferred successor.
Under the leadership of party chairwoman Angela Merkel, Schavan was re-elected vice-chairwoman of the CDU in November 2006, this time alongside minister-presidents Roland Koch, Jürgen Rüttgers and Christian Wulff.


=== Minister of Education and Research, 2005–2013 ===
Schavan served as Federal Minister of Education and Research from 2005 to February 2013. Following the 2009 federal elections, she was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the FDP on a coalition agreement. She led her party's delegation in the working group on education and research policy; her co-chair of the FDP was Andreas Pinkwart.
In an effort to increase the share of female university lecturers and tenured professors, Schavan introduced a €150 million equal-opportunities program under which the federal government paid the salary of between one and three additional posts for highly qualified female academics that proved a commitment to redressing the gender imbalance.In 2010, Schavan led efforts to enlist imams educated at German universities to improve the integration of young Muslims. Under a plan devised by the German Council of Science and Humanities, imams were to be trained at two or three German universities, in accordance with the German curriculum. In addition to theology, the new preachers would also study education and community organizing. In a competition, the universities of Tübingen, Münster and Osnabrück were selected for the program.On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Germany and India, Schavan participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries' governments in Delhi in May 2011.In 2012, Schavan chaired the Joint Science Conference (GWK), a body which deals with all questions of research funding, science and research policy strategies and the science system that jointly affect the federal government and the 16 federal states.
Following her resignation, Schavan was succeeded by Johanna Wanka.


== Life after politics ==
Ahead of the Christian Democrats' leadership election in 2018, Schavan publicly endorsed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Angela Merkel as the party's chair.In April 2023, Schavan was one of the 22 personal guests at the ceremony in which Angela Merkel was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit for special achievement by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Schloss Bellevue in Berlin.


== Plagiarism ==
Amid the plagiarism scandal that led to the resignation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Minister of Defence of Germany on 1 March 2011, Schavan was quoted in Der Spiegel as saying that ""intellectual theft is not a small thing"". In 2012, a blogger with the pseudonym Robert Schmidt who is a member of the research-network VroniPlag Wiki alleged he had found plagiarism in Schavan's PhD thesis, entitled ""Character and conscience – Studies on the conditions, necessities, and demands on the development of conscience in the present day."" The University of Düsseldorf conducted an investigation into the plagiarism charge. Investigators found paraphrasing of secondary literature without naming the source in over 60 cases in the dissertation and thereby on 5 February 2013 revoked her doctorate degree because of ""systematic and premeditated"" deception.On 9 February 2013, it was reported that chancellor Angela Merkel had accepted Annette Schavan's resignation. Schavan continued to deny any wrongdoing and pursued a court appeal against the process by which the university had revoked her doctorate. On 20 March 2014 a Düsseldorf court rejected her appeal, however.

In 1963 and 1970, she bore two more children. In 1974 her husband gave up his work as an architect, as her salary was bigger than his.

25,"Ursula ""Ulla"" Schmidt (born 13 June 1949) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). From 2001 to 2009 she was Federal Minister of Health in the German Government. Between 2013 and 2017, she served as Vice-President of the German Bundestag.


== Early life and education ==
Schmidt studied at RWTH Aachen University and FernUniversität Hagen before working as a teacher specialising in special needs education and the rehabilitation of children with learning difficulties and behavioural issues.


== Political career ==


=== Early beginnings ===
In 1976 Schmidt was a candidate of the Maoist ""Kommunistischer Bund Westdeutschland"" (KBW) (Communist League of West Germany) for the Federal Assembly of Germany (Bundestag) in Aachen. The KBW dissolved completely in 1985.
In 1983, Schmidt changed to the Social Democratic Party (SPD). There she is a member of the local (Aachen) leadership and of the ""Seeheimer Kreis"". She was elected to the German Bundestag in the first elections in reunified Germany on 2 December 1990, representing the Aachen I constituency.


=== Member of the Federal Government ===
As deputy leader of the Social Democratic parliamentary group between 1998 and 2001, Schmidt first gained respect in Parliament for her strong defense of pension reforms proposed by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder government in 2000.After the resignation of incumbent Andrea Fischer, who took the blame for the government's chaotic response to the discovery of ten cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Schmidt became Federal Minister for Health under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2001. A year later, the responsibility for social security was added to her portfolio and she was appointed Federal Minister for Health and Social Security.
During her tenure as Germany’s long-serving minister of health, Schmidt oversaw major system reforms, balancing social solidarity with fiscal responsibility. In September 2003, Schmidt worked to tighten the regulations allowing welfare benefits to German expatriates. Under the new rules, the only people to receive benefits are Germans who are receiving long-term medical treatment outside the country or who are in foreign jails.In November 2005, Schmidt again became Federal Minister for Health in the grand coalition of Angela Merkel. Social security was reunited with the portfolio of labour, which in 2002 had been added to that of the Federal Minister for Economics. By 2006, Schmidt led negotiations for an agreement on changes to Germany’s healthcare financing.In July 2009, the Social Democrats’ candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel, Frank Walter Steinmeier, dropped Schmidt from his campaign team for the federal elections, after she embarrassed the party by taking her official Mercedes and chauffeur on a vacation to Spain, where it was stolen and later returned.

34,"Kristina Schröder (née Köhler, born 3 August 1977) is a German politician who served as the Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2009 to 2013. She served as a Member of Parliament between 2002 and 2017.


== Early life and education ==
Schröder was born Kristina Köhler in Wiesbaden, Hessen. After finishing her abitur in 1997, she studied sociology, history, philosophy, and political science at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. She earned her Diplom in 2002, and her Ph.D. in 2009. Her doctoral thesis was Gerechtigkeit als Gleichheit? Eine empirische Analyse der objektiven und subjektiven Responsivität von Bundestagsabgeordneten (English: ""Justice as equality? An empirical analysis of the objective and subjective responsivity of members of parliament""), supervised by Jürgen W. Falter.
Following Schröder's appointment as government minister, her doctoral research came under close scrutiny for its heavy reliance on research assistance by her party. In 2011 it was reported that an assistant of Falter had been paid by Schröder for working on the statistical data on which the thesis was based. The university's president stated there was no evidence for any wrongdoing, and that legwork undertaken by aides was scientifically legitimate and accepted practice.


== Political career ==
Schröder joined the Junge Union in 1991 and has been a member of the Bundestag since 2002, affiliated with the CDU. Between 2002 and 2009, she served as member on the Committee on Internal Affairs.

On 30 November 2009, Schröder was appointed Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth in the cabinet of Angela Merkel. During her time in office, the government approved a bill to provide parents of 1- and 2-year-old children with an allowance for keeping their toddlers out of state-run day care, a move that critics said would derail recent efforts to encourage German women to return to work after starting a family. Amid a conflict within her own political party over the question of setting a statutory quota for female participation in the supervisory boards of companies in Germany, Schröder backed a voluntary scheme.When Germany's government reduced compulsory military service from nine months to six in 2009, Schröder took the lead on introducing the Federal Volunteers Service (BFD), a German government program which encourages volunteerism among young adults for public welfare, to fill the gaps left by changes to the national service system.Unlike many in her party at the time, Schröder spoke out in support of civil unions in 2012, saying that ""in lesbian and gay life partnerships, people take lasting responsibility for one another and thus they live according to conservative values.""Since the 2013 elections, Schröder has been the deputy chairwoman of the Committee on the Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure, which is chaired by Johann Wadephul. In addition, she serves as member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Energy, where she is her parliamentary group's rapporteur on the media, food and pharmaceutical industries as well as on space technology.
In April 2016, Schröder announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term. By the end of the parliamentary term, she joined communication consultancy Deekeling Arndt Advisors as Senior Advisor.

She attended the Training and Further Education Centre (Fachhochschule für Finanzen) in Königs Wusterhausen.


== Political career ==


=== Career in local politics ===

=== Career in national politics ===
Schwesig became a Federal Deputy Leader of the SPD on 13 November 2009 alongside Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel and Olaf Scholz (and later Aydan Özoğuz and Ralf Stegner). She was then appointed State Minister of Social Affairs and Health in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on 6 October 2008, under the leadership of Minister‐President Erwin Sellering. She served as minister and became member of the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern from 4 September 2011 until she joined the federal government.
Ahead of the 2009 elections, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier included Schwesig, then a relatively unknown face to the German public, in his shadow cabinet of 10 women and eight men for the Social Democrats' campaign to unseat incumbent Angela Merkel as Chancellor. During the campaign, Schwesig served as shadow minister for family affairs who advocated the party's family-friendly policies.Schwesig was a SPD delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2010, 2012, 2017 and 2022.In 2011, Schwesig led high-level talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen for the then-opposition Social Democrats on reaching a compromise over how to increase basic social welfare benefits for the unemployed.Following the 2013 elections, Schwesig served as the Social Democrats' main negotiator in the working group for families, women and equal opportunities when Germany's two largest parties, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc and the left-leaning Social Democrats, held talks on forming a broad coalition government.

Shortly after, the party's board mandated Schwesig and Thomas Oppermann with the task of drafting an electoral program for the 2017 federal elections.

The party's campaign was heavily based around her, running with the slogan ""Die Frau für MV"" (""the woman for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern""). The SPD a landslide victory with 39.6% of votes while the AfD, CDU, and Left all suffered losses. They chose to seek a coalition government with the Left, breaking the grand coalition with the CDU after fifteen years in power.

Meanwhile, she has been championing a substantial expansion of state-sponsored child care facilities.In 2016, Schwesig successfully introduced changes to Germany's maternity protection legislation by expanding the laws to include groups of women not explicitly covered (including school and university students, women working as interns, and women pursuing vocational training) and attempting to reduce bureaucratic red tape.Alongside Dietmar Woidke, Schwesig was instrumental in the Bundesrat's 2020 selection of Ines Härtel as the Federal Constitutional Court’s first judge from East Germany.


=== Political extremism ===
In a 2014 lawsuit before the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) complained about comments made by Schwesig during that year's parliamentary election campaign for the state of Thuringia. In a newspaper interview, Schwesig had said: ""The number one goal is that the NPD does not make it into the parliament."" The NPD accused the minister of breaching her duty of neutrality and interfering with the campaign, and made a complaint before the Federal Constitutional Court. The court ruled in December 2014 that Schwesig did not damage the NPD's right to a level playing field because her comments fell under the ""political struggle of opinion.""


== Controversy ==


=== Nord Stream 2 ===
In her role as Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Schwesig stated her strong support for Nord Stream 2; ""We believe that it is right to build the pipeline. Nobody who is working on building the pipeline is doing anything wrong. The ones doing something wrong are those who are trying to stop the pipeline.""   Her government created a foundation with the explicit goal, as written in its charter, of completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Amid a 2020 diplomatic row over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, three U.S. senators − Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, and Ron Johnson – sent a letter to a Baltic Sea port operator in Schwesig's state, threatening the port's managers with “crushing legal and economic sanctions” if they continued to support the project servicing the Russian ships laying the pipe. In response, Schwesig called the letter ""blackmail"".After the poisoning of opposition figure Alexey Navalny, Schwesig insisted it should have no effect on the construction of the pipeline. Ultimately, the project was cancelled after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, Schwesig was revealed to have been colluding with the Russians, allowing Gazprom to run PR for the pipeline via her office and modifying her public speeches in accordance with the Russian demands.Schwesig has been listed by Politico among 12 Germans who got played by Putin.In February 2022, Schwesig lost a court case against member of the Bundestag Christoph Ploß. She had demanded he limit his criticisms of her politics but a district court determined that it was well within allowed freedom of expression.In January 2023, controversy arose over contacts Schewesig had with various people as part of Reuters research into Russian influence in Germany and German politics. She had contact with Oleg Eremenko who had formerly worked for the Russian secret service (GRU) and now is the owner of a construction company in Berlin. Event records show Eremenko was in contact during 2016 with Igor Girkin, a colonel in the Russian military intelligence service GRU, who had played a leading role in the Russian intervention in the Donbas and the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""Schwesig's spokesman Andreas Timm said ... that there had been 'no scheduled meeting' between the Prime Minister and Eremenko [and that] she took part in the event at the invitation of the city of Greifswald.""In March 2024 media reported that Schwesing had intervened into the process of publication of an declaratively independent report on the options for closure of  Stiftung Klima- und Umweltschutz MV (Climate and Environment Protection Foundation) which served as a Gazprom-sponsored lobbyist for Nord Stream 2. Schwesing manually deleted paragraphs from the report that suggested that closure of the foundation is feasible and desirable.

51,"Heide Simonis (German: [ˈhaɪdə ziˈmoːnɪs]; 4 July 1943 – 12 July 2023) was a German author and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). She was minister of finance in Schleswig-Holstein from 1988 until 1993, when she became minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein. She was the first woman to serve as head of a state government in German history and the only woman to do so in the 20th century, serving until 2005. As of September 2023, she is also the longest serving former female minister-president of a German state (11 years, 343 days).


== Early life and education ==
Born Heide Steinhardt in Bonn on 4 July 1943, she was the oldest of three sisters. She had asthma as a young child and therefore spent time in children's homes from age three. She completed school with the Abitur in 1962 in Nürnberg. She then studied economics and sociology at the universities of Erlangen-Nürnberg and Kiel, graduating with a degree in economics in 1967. She worked in different positions after 1967, beginning as a lecturer at the University of Lusaka in Zambia. She worked with her husband for an advisory panel of the WHO in Japan on health development. She later worked as vocational counsellor at the employment office of Kiel.


== Career ==


=== National politics ===
Simonis joined the SPD in 1969. She was elected to the German Bundestag in 1976, representing the Rendsburg-Eckernförde district, as then the youngest member of the parliament.


=== State politics ===
In 1988, Simonis was appointed minister of finance in Schleswig-Holstein by minister-president Björn Engholm. In the 1992 state elections, she became a member of the legislature of Schleswig-Holstein.On 19 May 1993, Simonis was elected minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein after her predecessor Engholm resigned due to a scandal. She was the first woman in Germany to rise to this level in government. For her first cabinet, she kept almost all of Engholm's ministers.The 1996 state elections saw the SPD representation drop to 39.8% from 46.2% in 1992, but Simonis was able to form a coalition with the Greens. In the 2000 state elections, at the height of a Christian Democratic Union's donations scandal, the SPD was able to increase its share to 43.1%. At the time, the result was also seen as marking a victory for Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who had campaigned ardently in support of Simonis.Despite basing its campaign for the 2005 elections on Simonis' popularity, the SPD suffered a heavy defeat due to the bad economic situation and its support dropped to 38.7% (for the first time in almost twenty years behind the CDU). On 17 March 2005, Simonis failed to be re-elected as minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein in four consecutive ballots by the Schleswig-Holstein Landtag. In the first ballot she received 34 votes and Peter Harry Carstensen (CDU) received 33, while two deputies cast empty votes. Neither Simonis nor Carstensen got the absolute majority (35 votes). In the second and third ballots the candidates received 34 votes each, while one deputy of the alliance of SPD, Greens, and SSW abstained. An unprecedented fourth ballot brought the same result and Simonis stepped down as minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein.


=== After politics ===
Simonis served as chairwoman of the German Committee for UNICEF from 2005 until February 2008. She resigned from this position due to a scandal related to donations to the organisation that arose during her term.


== Personal life and legacy ==
In 1967, Simonis married Udo E. Simonis who had studied with her. He became a professor of economics, with a focus on the environment. Among her hobbies was quiltmaking.Simonis survived breast cancer. She announced in 2014 that she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. She died at home in Kiel on 12 July 2023, at age 80.President Frank-Walter Steinmeier described her as an exceptional political personality who shaped democracy beyond Schleswig-Holstein. He noted her competence, but also humanity and empathy.

She was on vacation in France during the disaster. Spiegel had (falsely) stated that she had attended a cabinet meeting in Rhineland-Palatinate during her vacation. Up from March 2022, Spiegel was heavily criticized because internal documents revealed that she was more concerned with making her ministry look good than with assuming responsibility for the disaster.Spiegel resigned from her post on 11 April 2022. She stated: ""Due to political pressure, I decided today to make the office of Federal Minister for Family Affairs available. I am doing this to avert damage to the office, which is facing major political challenges."" She made no reference to her alleged mistakes in the statement.

After a 15-year-old girl was stabbed to death by her Afghan-born ex-boyfriend in Kandel in 2017, Spiegel – in her capacity as state minister in charge of integration – faced such massive hostility and threats that she was given personal protection.Flood disaster in the Ahr valley
In March 2022, text messages that Spiegel exchanged with her press spokesman while she was Rhineland-Palatinate's environment minister and that were available to the 18/1 investigative committee of the state parliament on the flood disaster in Rhineland-Palatinate became public. According to reports in the FAZ and other media, these text messages suggest that the state government did not react to the flood in time and that Spiegel, the environment minister at the time, was primarily concerned about her image.

A former member of the Labour Party, she now sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.Born and raised in West Germany, Stuart moved to the United Kingdom in 1974. Elected for Birmingham Edgbaston at the 1997 general election, she was chair of the Vote Leave Campaign Committee and was one of its most high-profile figures, along with the Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. The Vote Leave campaign was successful in achieving its goal at the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum of winning a majority of votes for Leave. From 2016 to 2020, she served as chair of Vote Leave's successor organisation, Change Britain.
After she had left Parliament, Stuart was appointed by the Conservative government as chair of Wilton Park, an executive agency of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to conflict resolution in international relations, in October 2018. She is a member of the Steering Committee of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party organisation chaired by Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, which seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK by way of a new Act of Union. The Constitution Reform Group's new Act of Union Bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill on 9 October 2018.
Baroness Stuart was appointed as the First Civil Service Commissioner in March 2022.


== Early life ==
Gisela Gschaider was born in Velden, Bavaria, West Germany on 26 November 1955 to Martin and Liane Gschaider. She attended the Staatliche Realschule in Vilsbiburg. After doing an apprenticeship in bookselling, she moved to the UK in 1974 in order to improve her English and to do a Business Studies course at Manchester Polytechnic. She was deputy director of the 1983 London Book Fair. Stuart subsequently relocated to the Midlands.
She graduated from the University of London with an LLB in 1993, having studied through the University of London External System. She began researching for a PhD in trust law (ownership of pension funds) at the University of Birmingham while she also lectured Law to AAT students at Worcestershire College, but did not complete her PhD and instead went into politics full-time.In 1994, as Gisela Gschaider, Stuart contested the Worcester and South Warwickshire seat at the European elections for Labour. She lost by 1,000 votes.


== Parliamentary career ==
In 1995, Stuart was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency. The constituency, which had once been held by former Conservative Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (1937–40), had returned only Conservative MPs for 99 years. The sitting Conservative MP at the time, Dame Jill Knight, was retiring after 31 years. On 1 May 1997, Stuart was elected as the first-ever Labour MP for the constituency, making it one of a succession of traditional Conservative seats to fall to Labour control in a landslide victory for the party. Stuart's victory was the first televised Labour gain of the evening.
During the First Blair ministry, Stuart served on the Social Security Select Committee and in 1998 as PPS to Home Office Minister of State Paul Boateng, before joining the government in 1999 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health. Stuart left this post in the reshuffle that followed after the 2001 election. Her election agent in that election was John Clancy, who became Leader of Birmingham City Council in 2015.In Blair's second ministry, Stuart was appointed as one of the UK Parliamentary Representatives to the European Convention, which was tasked with drawing up a new constitution for the European Union. In this capacity, Stuart also served as one of the thirteen members of the Convention's Presidium – the steering group responsible for managing the business of the Convention and which drafted the text of the constitution then approved by the full Convention.
After the draft Constitution emerged, Stuart became one of the most trenchant critics of the proposal, stating that it had been drawn up by a ""self-selected group of the European political elite"" determined to deepen European integration. She subsequently expounded these views in a 2004 Fabian Society pamphlet, The Making of Europe's Constitution. Consequently, she argued in favour of British withdrawal from the European Union, becoming one of the leading Eurosceptic figures in the Labour Party.  These views were countered in a rebuttal by the European Parliamentary Labour Party spokesman on EU constitutional affairs published on-line by the Fabians and in a pamphlet publihed by the Labour Movement for EuropeIn October 2004, she became the only Labour MP who openly supported the re-election of George W. Bush at that year's U.S. presidential election, arguing ""you know where you stand with George and, in today's world, that's much better than rudderless leaders who drift with the prevailing wind"". She wrote that a victory for Democratic Party challenger, John Kerry, would prompt ""victory celebrations among those who want to destroy liberal democracies. More terrorists and suicide bombers would step forward to become martyrs in their quest to destroy the West"".Between 2001 and 2010, Stuart also served as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.She retained her seat at the 2005 election but her majority was halved in both percentage and numerical terms. Despite the predictions of the pundits, Stuart went on to retain the seat at the 2010 general election, against a national tide of Labour defeat. The election resulted in the first hung parliament in 36 years, with the Conservatives having the most seats. It earned her the title of Survivor of the Year at The Spectator magazine's 2010 Parliamentarian of the Year awards, which was presented to her by the new Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron. She retained her seat at the 2015 election with a majority of 2,706 votes, more than double her majority from 2010. She joined the Commons Select Committee on Defence.Stuart is a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society principles, which promote the spread of liberal democracy across the world and the maintenance of a strong military with global expeditionary reach.She was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2015, giving her the honorific title ""The Right Honourable"" for life.Since 2015, Stuart has been a Steering Committee member of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party pressure group of current and former politicians, academics, constitutional law experts, former officials in Parliament and government and ordinary citizens. The CRG seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK by way of a new Act of Union. The Constitution Reform Group's new Act of Union Bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill by Lord Lisvane in the House of Lords on 9 October 2018, when it received a formal first reading. The BBC described the Bill as ""one to watch"" in that Parliament.She announced on 19 April 2017 that she would not seek re-election at the 2017 snap general election. She was succeeded by Preet Gill, a Labour and Co-operative politician, and the first female British Sikh MP.In 2019, Stuart announced she would vote for the Conservative Party in the 2019 general election. She remained a member of the Labour Party after the election.In the 2019 Dissolution Honours, Stuart was given a life peerage; she initially sat as a non-affiliated peer before becoming a Crossbencher.


== Vote Leave ==
Stuart served as Chair of Vote Leave, the body which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership. Other spokespersons for Vote Leave included Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. There were various other groups advocating for Leave, officially working independently of Vote Leave, including UKIP and the Labour Leave.
In the BBC's two-hour televised debate on the EU referendum, Stuart appeared on the ""Leave"" panel, along with the Conservative MPs Andrea Leadsom and Boris Johnson.Stuart's own constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston voted to Remain in the EU.After stepping down at the 2017 general election, Stuart revealed that she had pushed for an exit clause in the European Constitution, which later became Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 50 allows for withdrawal from the European Union by any member state and was invoked for the first and only time by Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017.

92,"Awet Tesfaiesus (Tigrinya: ዓወት ተስፋየሱስ; born 5 October 1974) is a German politician from Alliance 90/The Greens who has served as a member of the Bundestag from the state of Hesse since 2021. Previously a lawyer who represented asylum seekers and refugees, Tesfaiesus was elected as a city councillor for the city of Kassel in 2016. Tesfaiesus was elected in the 2021 German federal election as a member of the Green Party list in the state of Hesse. She is the first black woman to ever be elected to the Bundestag.


== Political career ==
Tesfaiesus has been a member of Alliance 90/The Greens since 2009. After expressing concern over the Alternative for Germany's entry into the Kassel city council as a result of increased anti-immigrant sentiments, she decided to enter municipal politics to become a city councillor. She was elected to Kassel's city council in 2016 and introduced anti-discrimination legislation inspired by her experiences dealing with racism in her daily life. Tesfaiesus cited her experience of being shut out of being offered apartments due to her surname, only to have her German-born husband call and be accepted.Tesfaiesus also cited the 2020 Hanau shootings, where a far-right extremist engaged in a racially motivated mass shooting in Hesse, her home state, as her reason for entering national politics. She had previously considered withdrawing from the political scene, but was incentivized to step forward in response to the xenophobic attacks.Tesfaiesus ran as a direct candidate in Werra-Meißner – Hersfeld-Rotenburg constituency in the 2021 federal election and placed fourth. Tesfaiesus' campaign slogan was ""courage to change"". She was in ninth position on the Greens party list for the state of Hesse, and was elected to the Bundestag. Tesfaiesus became the first black woman elected to the Bundestag in what was a younger and more ethnically diverse Bundestag cohort than previously.Tesfaiesus aims to remove barriers to naturalization within Germany, including lifting restrictions imposed by the dual citizenship status. Tesfaiesus wished to use her platform to demonstrate to people who did not ""look German"" that they had a place within Germany's society and political culture.


== Other activities ==
German Federal Film Board (FFA), Alternate Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2022)


== Personal life ==
Tesfaiesus was born in Asmara, Eritrea (then known as Eritrea Province under Ethiopian rule) in 1974, less than a month after the Derg overthrew the government of the Ethiopian Empire. Her family had sought asylum in Germany to escape political persecution, as her father was sought out by the Ethiopian police due to his support for Eritrean independence.  Her family emigrated to the city of Heidelberg when Tesfaiesus was ten years old.Growing up, she failed to see any Afro-German representation on television, with the only exceptions being African Americans while she was watching MTV at 12 in the morning. She received aid from individuals who supported her in her childhood, including teachers and church groups, and she decided to pursue a career which would help repay their efforts. In her everyday life, she experienced individuals who would initially speak to her in English assuming that she was a foreigner. Tesfaiesus eventually was able to become a German citizen, and after contemplating it in 1996, she subsequently accepted the offer.Her first name means ""victory"" in the Tigrinya language.Tesfaiesus studied law and moved to Kassel in northern Hesse, where she had lived for the past 20 years. Tesfaiesus primarily focuses on cases pertaining to foreigners and asylum law, and often represents asylum seekers and refugees.Tesfaiesus had considered moving to Belgium with her 10-year-old son and husband following the Hanau shootings and the elevated xenophobia which had been the cause for the incident.
