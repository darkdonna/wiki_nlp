6,"Brigitte Bierlein (German: [b ÅiÀà…°…™t…ô ÀàbiÀê…êÃØla…™n]; born 25 June 1949) is an Austrian former jurist who served as president of the Constitutional Court before serving as chancellor of Austria from June 2019 until January 2020. An Independent, she was the first woman to hold either office.
Bierlein served as the advocate general of the Procurator's Office ‚Äì essentially the country's chief public prosecutor ‚Äì from 1990 to 2002, as well as a member of the executive board of the International Association of Prosecutors from 2001 to 2003. In 2003, Bierlein was made a member and the vice president of the Constitutional Court.
Following the Ibiza affair, President Alexander Van der Bellen named Bierlein Chancellor of Austria, after a parliamentary motion of no confidence dismissed the first government of Sebastian Kurz, the first successful motion of no confidence in Austrian modern history. She was the first woman to assume the role and served until the next government led by Kurz was sworn in following the legislative election which took place on 29 September 2019.


== Early life ==
Brigitte Bierlein was born on 25 June 1949 in Vienna during the Allied occupation of Austria. Her father was a civil servant. Her mother, trained as an artist, was a homemaker. She was educated at the Gymnasium Kundmanngasse, from which she graduated in 1967. Bierlein originally wanted to study either art or architecture and came close to joining the University of Applied Arts. However, she ultimately chose to study law instead, partly on the advice of her mother and partly because she did not want to be a financial burden on her parents any longer than necessary. Bierlein enrolled at the University of Vienna, receiving her doctorate of law in 1971.


== Judicial career ==
Bierlein served for four years as a candidate judge, before she was officially elevated to the judiciary in 1975.
She spent the next two years presiding over trial courts, first the District Court Innere Stadt (German: Bezirksgericht Innere Stadt Wien) and then the District Tribunal Vienna (Strafbezirksgericht Wien), a criminal court that has since been dissolved.
In the former position, she mostly dealt with cases at tenancy law, an area that appears to have bored her greatly.In 1977, Bierlein left the bench to join the Vienna Public Prosecutor's Office (Staatsanwaltschaft Wien). She was responsible for general and political criminal cases as well as for criminal cases pursuant to media law, a type of proceedings customarily handled by dedicated specialists in Austria. In 1986, Bierlein was promoted to the Vienna Chief Public Prosecutor's Office (Oberstaatsanwaltschaft Wien). She was now a distinguished civil servant attached to one of the country's five most senior criminal chambers. In 1987, she spent a few months working in the Department of Criminal Law in the Ministry of Justice, then returned to her position in the prosecution service.In 1990, she was appointed advocate general of the Procurator's Office, the section of the prosecution service attached directly to the Supreme Court. 
She was the first woman to serve in this position.The same year, Bierlein became a member of the board of examiners for judges and prosecutors at the Vienna Higher Regional Court, a position she would hold until 2010.In 1995, Bierlein was appointed to the executive board of the Association of Austrian Prosecutors. From 2001 to 2003, she served as the association's president. Also from 2001 to 2003, she held a seat on the executive board of the International Association of Prosecutors.In 2002, the first Sch√ºssel government recommended Bierlein for appointment as vice president of the Constitutional Court.
The move was not uncontroversial at the time. Bierlein had prosecuted crime with great fervor but had not distinguished herself as a legal scholar; she is in fact considered indifferent as a theorist to this day. Opposition politicians such as Josef Cap accused the government of passing over multiple more competent candidates in favor of a partisan hack. Bierlein supporters such as Maria Fekter countered that Bierlein's appointment would be an important step towards gender equality in Austria.According to the well-known Austrian law professor Werner Doralt, Bierlein owed her career at the Constitutional Court to the Austrian politician J√∂rg Haider and her life partner, the Austrian judge Ernest Maurer, a close friend of J√∂rg Haider.Assenting to the cabinet's recommendation, President Thomas Klestil appointed Bierlein on 21 November 2002, the appointment to be effective 1 January 2003. 
Once again, Bierlein was the first woman to serve in the role she was being elevated to.
In fact, there had been no women at all on the Constitutional Court until 1995.Bierlein took over from the president of the court, Gerhart Holzinger, when he retired from the bench effective 31 December 2017.On the initiative of the Freedom Party, the right-of-center first Kurz government moved to turn her interim position into a permanent one.
President Alexander Van der Bellen confirmed Bierlein as the new president of the Constitutional Court on 23 February 2018.
Bierlein's previous role as vice president passed on to Supreme Court justice Christoph Grabenwarter. 
Wolfgang Brandstetter, who had formerly been vice chancellor and minister of justice on a People's Party ticket, was appointed to fill the vacancy of the Court.Bierlein reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 2019.


== Politics ==
Bierlein has no political affiliation. She is seen as solidly right of centre. During her time as a prosecutor, she was noted for her hardline tough-on-crime stance, although her years on the bench have earned her a reputation for civility and for working well with ideological opponents.
Commentators from both sides of the political spectrum note Bierlein's close ties to both People's Party and Freedom Party, as well as the fact that her career owes both its unexpected major breaks to right-of-centre coalition governments.Bierlein herself acknowledges both her toughness as a prosecutor and her socially conservative bent in general. In response to doubts about her ability to remain above the fray as a Constitutional Court justice, she claims to be as committed to impartiality as any other professional judge and also points out that she has never actually joined any party.In December 2017 the Austrian Constitutional Court with Bierlein as president ruled to introduce same-sex marriage on 1 January 2019.
After the first Kurz government lost a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on 27 May 2019 following the Ibiza affair, Alexander Van der Bellen, the president of Austria, named Bierlein as Kurz's successor. She became the first female chancellor of Austria and was in office until the next government was formed following the National Council elections on 29 September 2019. Bierlein's appointment was agreed with all political parties in the National Council. She became the second independent to serve as a chancellor after Johannes Schober, who was in office twice between 1921 and 1930, and the first in Austria's post-war history.


== Personal life ==
Bierlein is unmarried and has no children. Her long-time partner was Ernest Maurer, a retired judge, who died in 2021. Bierlein is a supporter of the arts. She owns contemporary paintings, although she does not consider herself a collector. She also attends theatre and opera performances as well as museums. She enjoys skiing and sailing. In June 2020, Bierlein was pulled over on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. She was forced to surrender her driver's licence for four weeks and has since issued an apology.

A member of The Greens, she advocated for measures against drug and gambling addiction, including the establishment of safe consumption rooms and the banning of all low-cost slot machines in Vienna.

While in the Landtag, Cammerlander was a member of the committees on migration and human rights, and was the social policy spokesman for the Vienna Greens.During her tenure, Cammerlander advocated for measures against drug and gambling addictions. She supported shifting drug policy to focus on ""prevention, harm reduction and treatment"", and promoted the establishment of safe consumption rooms at the U-Bahn station in Karlsplatz, which had a large concentration of drug users. She also criticized a renovation plan at the station, arguing that ""turning Karlsplatz Passage into a glass case is not going to make drug addiction and alcoholism disappear"". Additionally, Cammerlander introduced a bill which would have banned small-scale gambling in Vienna, citing an increase in gambling addiction, particularly among minors. The bill targeted 2,000 ""low-stakes"" slot machines, which provided over 34 million euros in tax revenue for the city government per year; she argued that the low cost of the machines, which were capped by law at a maximum of fifty cents per game, made them much more attractive to minors.

19,"Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek (born 28 February 1969 as Eva Glawischnig) is an Austrian politician of the Austrian Green Party, and its federal spokeswoman from 2008 until 2017. She was the plaintiff in the landmark case Eva Glawishnig-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland, in which she sued Facebook for defamation to compel the social media company to globally censor the ""defamatory and all equivalent"" posts.


== Background ==
Born in Villach, Carinthia, Glawischnig attended gymnasium in Spittal an der Drau and took her Matura exams there. She then studied law at the University of Graz, Styria, graduating in 1993 (Magistra) and 1999 (doctorate) respectively.Glawischnig worked as a legal adviser for Global 2000 from 1992 until 1996. In that year she embarked on a career in regional politics for the Green Party of Vienna, later moving on to the federal level. She has been a member of the National Council of Austria (Nationalrat) since 1999 and became vice-chairperson of the Austrian Green Party in 2002. Glawischnig has been a persistent critic of the Austrian government headed by Wolfgang Sch√ºssel. On 30 October 2006 she became Third Speaker of the Austrian Parliament, as the first representative of the Greens in this office.On 3 October 2008, Glawischnig became the Greens' federal spokeswoman following Alexander Van der Bellen's resignation.On 18 May 2017, she resigned as the Greens' federal spokeswoman and retired from politics, citing personal reasons.She has been working for an international gambling company Novomatic since 2018.


=== Lawsuit against Facebook ===
In 2016, Glawischnig requested Facebook to remove a post criticizing her in sharp terms. After Facebook failed to remove the post, she brought a claim in Vienna court, Eva Glawischnig-Pieszcek v. Facebook Ireland. The case became an important legal question of whether a court in the European Union could compel a social media company to globally censor a user's posting, even for viewers outside of the EU's jurisdiction. On 3 October 2019 the Court of Justice for the European Union decided that an Austrian court could indeed order the global removal of the offensive posts, and all future posts similar to them that are designed to defame Glawishnig. Supporters of the Court's landmark ruling believe it empowers online users to defend themselves against defamation or other online abuse, while critics have called out the possibility of mass censorship due to the challenging nature of online rule enforcement.

23,"Sonja Hammerschmid (born Sonja Maria Theresia M√∂rwald on June 24, 1968 in Steyr) is an Austrian molecular biologist and politician.
She was Rector of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna from 2010 to 2016 and minister of education in the Kern government from 2016 to 2017.
Since 2017, Hammerschmid has been a member of the Austrian National Council.
Hammerschmid is a member of the Social Democratic Party.


== Early life ==
Sonja Hammerschmid was born as Sonja Maria Theresia M√∂rwald on June 24, 1968 in Steyr.Hammerschmid grew up in Baumgartenberg, a rural town of about 1200 people. She attended primary school from 1974 to 1978 and hauptschule from 1978 to 1982.
She completed her secondary education at the gymnasium in Perg, graduating in 1986.Hammerschmid's parents were working class. 
The region, bordering the Iron Curtain, was economically underprivileged; a large agricultural sector was trying to eke a living out of  some of the poorest soils in the country.
Hammerschmid's school career was highly respectable given her background and locale; educational mobility was low in small, disadvantaged rural towns in 1970s Austria. Hammerschmid freely admits to being a statistical outlier.


== Career ==
Starting in 1986, Hammerschmid studied genetics and tumor biology at the University of Vienna, receiving a master's degree in 1992 and a PhD in 1995.
From 1990 to 1995, she was also working as a research associate at Boehringer Ingelheim.Hammerschmid followed her dissertation with two years of postdoctoral work at the Vienna Biocenter.
In 1998, Hammerschmid abandoned her science career, frustrated with the grind of lab work and the unpredictability of the race to publication.
After a few months as a product manager at Margaritella-Biotrade, she became the executive manager of the Innovation Agency (German: Innovationsagentur GmbH), a government agency for the promotion of young entrepreneurs, where she spent her time organizing competitions and subsidy programs and generally linking up innovative startups with investor advice and money.
When the Innovation Agency was absorbed into the Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft in 2003, Hammerschmid became the new institution's Head of Technology and Innovation.Hammerschmid also served on numerous supervisory boards and committees.In September 2010, Hammerschmid was appointed rector of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, originally for a term of four years. She easily won reappointment for a second term.
In December 2015, Hammerschmid was elected president of Universities Austria (√ñsterreichische Universit√§tenkonferenz or Uniko), the lobbying federation of Austria's public universities. Inaugurated in January 2016, she was the first woman to lead the organization. Hammerschmid resigned from both positions upon entering politics in 2016.


== Political career ==
Hammerschmid considered going into formal politics for most of her adult life and systematically built a strong network of useful connections.
Even so, she did not join any political party.
Her working-class family background, which she says kept strongly influencing her ideologically, would have naturally positioned her left of center.
In matters of education and science policy, however, she felt more closely aligned with the Austrian People's Party, a party philosophically conservative and sociologically middle to upper class.
She is also broadly sympathetic to classical liberalism, stating in an interview that some of the platform planks of NEOS would resonate with her.
Hammerschmid is not easily pigeonholed into any of the three or four traditional Austrian camps.In 2014, the People's Party briefly considered tapping her for state secretary of scientific research.In May 2016, Christian Kern took over as the head of the exhausted and beleaguered coalition of Social Democrats and People's Party in the middle of an election cycle.
Kern immediately reshuffled his cabinet, trying to revitalize the coalition through four new appointments.
Besides trying to project optimism and present fresh faces, Kern was also attempting to hint at having a certain technocratic streak.
Kern's ideal candidate would not have a strong party power base, so as not to be able to prevent him from consolidating power, but would nevertheless be able to serve as a token of good faith to one of the party's for major factions.
Hammerschmid fit the bill and was a good choice as Kern's message to the right wing of the party.
On May 18, 2016, Hammerschmid was appointed head of the Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs.
A subsequent reapportionment of ministerial responsibilities ‚àí a maneuver regularly undertaken by new parliamentary majority leaders ‚àí moved women's affairs into the purview of the Ministry of Health.
On July 1, 2016, Hammerschmid received her new permanent appointment as the minister of education.Hammerschmid joined the Social Democratic Party just in time for her official introduction to the rank and file.Sonja Hammerschmid's term as a minister ended when the coalition of Social Democrats and People's Party broke down following the October 2017 election. Taking office on December 18, 2017, the right-of-center first Kurz government replaced Hammerschmid with Heinz Fa√ümann. The election had landed Hammerschmid with a seat on the National Council, however. Since November 9, 2017, Hammerschmid has been serving in the national legislature.

24,"Beate Hartinger-Klein (born Beate Hartinger; 9 September 1959) is an Austrian healthcare and insurance manager, educator and politician. A member of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ), she was a member of the National Council from October 1999 to December 2002. From December 2017 to May 2019, Hartinger-Klein served as minister of social affairs in the first government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.


== Life ==
Beate Hartinger-Klein, n√©e Hartinger, was born on 9 September 1959 in Graz.She attended primary school from 1966 to 1970 and middle school from 1970 to 1974. She completed her secondary education at a commercial academy (German: Handelsakademie), a type of five-year high school similar to a gymnasium but with added business-oriented vocational training. After graduating from the academy, she studied social and economic science at the University of Graz, obtaining a master's degree in 1984.From 1984 to 1985, Hartinger-Klein was employed as a case manager in a tax accountancy firm.
In January 1986 she took on a management role with Kastner & √ñhler, a then-major department store chain.
A few months later, in July 1987, she moved into the public healthcare and social insurance sector, starting as an internal auditor for Styria's public hospital operator. By 1990, she had risen to Head of Controlling.
She also lectured at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, the University of Vienna, the UAS Krems, the UAS St. P√∂lten, and her alma mater, the University of Graz.Starting in August 2003, Hartinger-Klein served as the general manager of the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions (German: Hauptverband der Sozialversicherungstr√§ger), an umbrella organization supervising and representing all of Austria's public insurers. In 2005, she was promoted to deputy general secretary.
Her responsibilities included managing the multitude of contractual relationships the Association maintained with physicians, pharmacies, and the pharmaceutical industry. She was also in charge of matters of employment law, job training, institutional self-governance, and the sector's international relationships.
On 1 April 2009 she became the general manager of healthcare consulting for Deloitte Austria.
Hartinger-Klein and Deloitte quickly became ""disenchanted"" with each other, according to one acquaintance, due to pressure from high expectations and ill-defined responsibilities.
In April 2011, Hartinger-Klein left Deloitte and established her own business advisory agency, the Hartinger-Klein Consulting GmbH.Hartinger-Klein is married and a mother of two.


== Political career ==
Hartinger-Klein joined the Freedom Party in 1996.
The same year, she was appointed to the board of the Styrian regional healthcare fund (Gesundsheitsfonds Steiermark).
She successfully ran for a seat in the Styrian regional diet (Landtag) in 1995, serving from January 1996 to October 1999, and for a seat on the National Council in 1999, serving from October of that year to December 2002.Disillusioned with J√∂rg Haider after the Knittelfeld putsch in September 2002, Hartinger-Klein left the party, and politics in general. She declined to stand for the November 2002 National Council elections. Her seat on the Styrian healthcare fund board expired in 2003.
She later rejoined the Freedom Party, but not until 2013.On 18 December 2017 she was appointed to lead the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection as well as the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs as a member of the first Kurz government. Her dual role was due to the fact that the government was planning to merge the two ministries. These plans having been implemented, Hartinger-Klein was appointed minister of labor, social affairs, health and consumer protection on 8 January 2018.


== Controversies ==


=== Smoking bans ===
At the time the first Kurz government took office, Austria had enacted but not yet implemented a general smoking ban in bars and restaurants. The smoking ban had been passed in 2015 and was meant to go into full effect in May 2018.Heinz-Christian Strache, the populist Freedom Party leader and newly minted vice chancellor, opposed the ban. He demanded and eventually won the People's Party support in overturning the law.
Hartinger-Klein initially stated that she was ""not happy"" about the development but would grudgingly support it out of respect for democracy.
She later amended her position and declared herself opposed to smoking bans as a matter of principle. It was wrong, she asserted in a debate in the National Council, to forbid hosts from being hospitable, and unhelpful to subject minority rights to majority decisions.
Commentators, including right-of-center editorialists sympathetic to the cabinet as a whole, ridiculed her change of mind.
Hartinger-Klein's surprise about-face had come well after Strache's initiative had turned out to be broadly unpopular.


=== Social insurance reform ===
The first Kurz government planned a comprehensive reform of Austria's healthcare system.
The government's primary target is the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (Allgemeine Unfallversicherungsanstalt or AUVA), an arm of Austria's system of social insurance that insures workers, students, and small business owners against workplace accidents and occupational disease.
The government's official agenda demands that the AUVA cut its yearly spending by EUR 500 million. 
The cuts are alleged to be necessary to compensate for a planned reduction in insurance premiums: companies currently have to contribute 1.3 percent of each worker's salary to the AUVA; the government intends to decrease these payments to 0.8 percent.
The cabinet expects the AUVA to draw up appropriate measures by the end of the year and threatens to dissolve the institution should it fail to comply, distributing its responsibilities across other public insurers.The opposition and the medical establishment are harshly critical of the ultimatum.
Thomas Szekeres, the head of the Medical Council (√Ñrztekammer), the state medical board of registration and professional association of Austrian physicians, has condemned Hartinger-Klein's hard line. According to Szekeres, Austrian trauma care and rehabilitation facilities are ""excellent"" and the AUVA is an ""indispensable"" part of the system.
Employees of the Lorenz B√∂hler hospital in Vienna convened a protest meeting registering their opposition to Hartinger-Klein.Opposition politicians such as Josef Muchitsch, an employees' representative and member of parliament for the Social Democratic Party, have accused Hartinger-Klein of being biased against the AUVA.
In 2015, Hartinger-Klein had applied for the position of director general of the AUVA but had lost out to another candidate.
Hartinger-Klein alleged gender discrimination and complained to the relevant equal opportunities committee.
When the committee did not find in her favor, she filed suit, losing first the original trial and then two appeals. Her final appeal to the Supreme Court was still pending when she was appointed Minister of Health, although she did subsequently drop the case in January 2018.Max Lercher, General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, described Hartinger-Klein's attacks on the AUVA as a ""war"" and a ""personal vendetta"".


== Personal beliefs ==
Hartinger-Klein is not considered an ideological hardliner. In a 2018 interview, she claimed to have only joined the party in order to be able to accept a position as a speaker on social affairs in the Styrian diet, a job she felt compelled to take out of a sense of social responsibility. She in fact left the party for nearly eleven years between 2002 and 2013. Her political affiliation does not reflect family background. Her father identified as a conservative ‚àí an unusual and conspicuous posture for an Austrian railway worker at the time ‚àí and her mother was a Social Democrat.On her official ministry web page and in her official CV, Hartinger-Klein professes to be a member of the Austrian Evangelical Church, a mainstream but minority congregation in Catholic-dominated Austria. Austrian politicians are not usually expected to stress their congregational affiliations in this way. Hartinger-Klein's husband, Andreas Klein, is an Evangelical theologist, ethicist, lecturer with the University of Vienna, and ethics consultant.

She served as Deputy Mayor of Vienna and City Councillor for Urban Development, Transport, Climate Protection, Energy Planning, and Citizen Participation from 2019 to 2020. At the same time, she was chairwoman of the Vienna Greens. Prior, who served as a member of the Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna from 2010 to 2019. She resigned as party leader in January 2021, and later resigned her party membership in August, citing the policies of the √ñVP‚ÄìGreen federal government.


== Personal life ==
Hebein has lived in Vienna since 1986. She is a qualified social worker, and was employed by Caritas Vienna from 1990 to 1992. She also worked in other NGO areas and was active in the conscientious objection group Gruppe f√ºr Totalverweigerung (Group for Total Refusal).


== Political career ==
Hebein was responsible for security policy in the Austrian Students' Association from 1996 to 1997. She was elected district councillor for Rudolfsheim-F√ºnfhaus on the Greens list in the 2005 local elections, and served as group chairwoman from 2007. Hebein was elected to the Gemeinderat and Landtag in the 2010 Viennese state election. Thereafter she served as social affairs spokeswoman for the Vienna Greens.Hebein is secretary of the communist youth organisation ""Free Austrian Youth - Movement for Socialism"" (F√ñJ-BfS).When hundreds of refugees arrived at Vienna's Westbahnhof railway station in early September 2015, Hebein organized and negotiated with the authorities and √ñBB. In 2018 she drew attention to herself through her commitment to negotiations for the new Vienna minimum income and criticism of the alcohol ban in public spaces. She argued that the ban only leads to displacement, and suggested instead that moderate alcohol consumption should be permitted in care facilities for the homeless so that they do not have to rely on public space.


=== 2018 Greens leadership election ===
In November 2018, the Vienna Greens held an election to determine their lead candidate for the next state election. After incumbent Deputy Mayor and two-time lead candidate Maria Vassilakou announced her pending retirement and decision not to compete, the election was considered an open contest. Hebein announced her candidacy two days later on 4 September. She was considered a dark horse candidate, described by Der Standard as a representative of the left ""Fundi"" wing of the party. Hebein won 33% of votes cast in the first round, placing second behind Peter Kraus and ahead of candidates David Ellensohn, Benjamin Kaan, and Marihan Abensperg-Traun. In the fourth and final round of voting, she won the election with 49% of votes to Kraus's 45% (the remainder were invalid). Contrary to the speculation of commentators, she clarified that she would continue the Greens' coalition with the SP√ñ until the scheduled election date in 2020. Her reputation as a left-winger was reinforced by a widely-reported quip she made shortly after her victory: ""Yes, of course I do left-wing politics. What else?""During her first major appearance in front of the party base on 1 December, Hebein voiced her support for a restructuring and opening of the Greens. She stated her aim was to make the party more nimble and action-oriented, but that they should remain ecologically-centred.


=== Deputy Mayor ===
Upon Maria Vassilakou's retirement from politics in June 2019, Hebein succeeded her as deputy Mayor and city councillor. The Greens' state congress held at the time voted to change the statutes and, for the first time, establish the office of party chairperson. Hebein thus became the first party chairwoman of the Vienna Greens.At a party conference in February 2020, Hebein was formally chosen as the Greens' lead candidate for the October state election.The Greens won 14.8% in the election, their best result to date. They increased their representation in the Gemeinderat and Landtag from 10 to 16 seats. Afterwards, Hebein called for a renewal of the incumbent SP√ñ‚ÄìGreen government, citing the result as a ""very clear mandate"" for its continuation.However, the SP√ñ opted to form a coalition with NEOS rather than renew the incumbent government. After it became clear that the Greens would return to opposition, Hebein unsuccessfully sought election as Greens parliamentary chair, as well as to each of the Greens' non-executive city council positions.

33,"Karin Kneissl (born 18 January 1965) is an Austrian diplomat, journalist, and politician, having served as Minister of Foreign Affairs between 2017 and 2019. Prior to assuming her government position, she was a lecturer.
Kneissl has advocated for closer relations with Russia and is has a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Vienna, Kneissl spent part of her childhood in Amman, where her father worked as a pilot for King Hussein of Jordan and also was involved in developing Royal Jordanian Airlines. In her youth and student days Kneissl also was active in Amnesty International and supported environmental and human rights organizations worldwide.Kneissl studied law and oriental languages at the University of Vienna between 1983 and 1987. After graduating, she studied International relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Jordan in Amman. Subsequently, she spent a year as a Fulbright fellow at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown University. In 1992 she graduated from the √âcole nationale d'administration. 
In addition to German, Kneissl has claimed to work in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish. She also claims basic knowledge of Hebrew, Hungarian, and Italian.


== Diplomatic and political career ==
In 1990 she joined Austria's Foreign Office. From 1990 to 1998 she worked in the cabinet of √ñVP foreign minister Alois Mock, in the International Law Office, and was posted abroad in Paris and Madrid.She has claimed that she was among the co-founders of the Austrian section of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res in 1992/93, however the claim has been denied by the organization which has no record of her involvement.She left the diplomatic service in the fall of 1998, and lived in Seibersdorf near Vienna, where she was active between 2005 and 2010 as an independent local councilor on the list of √ñVP. Kneissl also worked as a freelance journalist for German and English-language print media and as a political analyist for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. She authored several specialized and non-fiction books.As an expert in international law, history of the Middle East and the energy market, Kneissl taught at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna, the European Business School in Rheingau and was a guest lecturer at the National Defense Academy, the Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt and at universities in Lebanon, among them the francophone Universit√© Saint-Joseph in Beirut. For ten years, she worked at the Department of Political Science at the University of Vienna. In her public writings and appearances Kneissl has often sharply criticized the European Union and raised controversy with remarks on migration. In July 2016, after the Brexit referendum, she criticized European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as ""cynic of power"", ""rowdy"" and ""arrogant"", who ""behaves as a Brussels Caesar, who has made it his goal to break agreements, if it seems useful.""A quote from her book ""My Middle East"" also caused controversy. She criticized Zionism, founded by Austro-Hungarian publicist Theodor Herzl, as a ""blood and soil ideology"" based on German nationalism in the 19th century.On the issue of refugees, migration, and integration she has been accused of perpetuating stereotypes. At the height of the 2015 European migrant crisis, Kneissl argued that most of them were economic migrants and that asylum seekers are ""80 percent"" young men between the ages of 20 and 30. In September 2015, she said on public television that one of the reasons for the revolts in the Arab world was ""these many young men"", ""testosterone-controlled"", ""who no longer managed to get a wife today"" because they have neither work nor their own home, and thus could not achieve ""status as a man in a traditional society"". She also sharply criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""grossly negligent"" for her selfies with refugees, and later described the EU-Turkey statement, 18 March 2016 as ""nonsense"".Such remarks led to criticism and caused doubts concerning her self-definition as a ""conservative free-thinker"", but also gained praise and sympathy from populist anti-migration party FP√ñ, to whose events she was increasingly invited. In 2016, FP√ñ leader Heinz-Christian Strache considered nominating Kneissl as presidential candidate, but eventually decided in favor of Norbert Hofer instead.After Hofer was defeated by Alexander van der Bellen, Kneissl criticised Van der Bellen on the occasion of the discussion about the headscarf-ban, doubting his intelligence, character and format. ""Not only Trump, others also provoke"", she said, criticizing Van der Bellen and Pope Francis, who had compared refugee camps to concentration camps.


=== Minister of Foreign Affairs ===
Kneissl was nominated by FP√ñ as a non-party member for the post of Foreign Minister of Austria in the government of Sebastian Kurz. Kneissl is the third woman to hold this function. Her nomination might also be linked to the reservations expressed by head of state Van der Bellen concerning other FP√ñ-endorsed candidates for the post.
Kneissl was praised by FP√ñ leader Heinz-Christian Strache as ""a great personality, a female Kreisky perhaps in the future when it comes to mediation, acceptance and advertising for Austria abroad.""In August 2018, she married entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger, 54, at a ceremony in the small town of Gamlitz, near the border with Slovenia. During the wedding, she danced with Vladimir Putin, who was in attendance, and subsequently performed a deep curtsey. Pictures of this gesture were widely published in Russian and international media, and sparked major outrage and criticism due to her perceived naivety. 
On 3 June 2019, after a vote of no confidence ended the First Kurz government, she left political office.


=== Later career ===
In 2020, Kneissl started to contribute opinion articles to Russian government outlet RT. In March 2021, Kneissl, who had disclosed financial problems at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, was reported to have been appointed by the Russian Government to the Board of Directors of the state gas company Rosneft.Shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 began, she dismissed intelligence reports, suggesting that the invasion was Western ""war hysteria"", blown up by the media. Kneissl resigned from the board of Rosneft in May 2022, after the invasion had begun. According to text messages she sent to a Washington Post reporter, she had emigrated from Austria because of ""death threats."" She was reported to have rented a home in Russian town of Petrushovo in 2022.On 5 September 2022, she appeared at Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia where she was interviewed by RIA and declared she immigrated to Lebanon. In 2023, she described herself as a ‚Äúpolitical refugee.‚ÄùIn September 2023, Russian media reported that she had resettled along with her two ponies in Saint Petersburg, where she would head the Geopolitical Observatory for Russia‚Äôs Key Issues (GORKI), a research center at St. Petersburg State University that was established in March 2023 and tasked with advancing Russian foreign policy. Her horses reportedly passed through six countries and at one point, were transported by  Russian military transport plane Ilyushin Il-76 from Syria that had been sanctioned by the United States and Ukraine for transporting Wagner Group mercenaries.

== Political career ==
In 2012, Rendi-Wagner joined the Association of Social Democratic University Graduates, an organization affiliated with the SP√ñ.Following the death of Minister for Health and Women Sabine Oberhauser in February 2017, Rendi-Wagner was appointed as her successor on 8 March, replacing interim minister Alois St√∂ger. She served in the government of Chancellor Christian Kern. Only shortly before her inauguration, she became a member of the SP√ñ. She became a member of the National Council in the election in October, but due to the change in government, she left the ministry on 18 December 2017. She declined to return as an official in the Ministry of Health. Thereafter, Rendi-Wagner became the SP√ñ's spokeswoman for health. She joined the joint committee as well as the committees for health, environment, economy, and foreign affairs, becoming deputy chair of the health committee.After Kern announced his pending resignation as SP√ñ chairman in September 2018, the party executive board designated Rendi-Wagner as his successor. She was confirmed at a party convention on 24 November with 97.8% of votes, becoming the first woman to lead the SP√ñ in the party's history. She stated that she wanted to define the party as modern, progressive, and cosmopolitan, pushing it to ""have the courage to provide simple and understandable answers"" and stand for equal opportunity and justice. She sought to provide a sharp contrast with the √ñVP and FP√ñ without opposing the government dogmatically. She said that she was ""not a fan of the left-right split"", and was perceived as seeking to bring the party to the centre.
On 28 May 2019, Rendi-Wagner was unanimously confirmed by the SP√ñ executive as the party's top candidate for the 2019 federal election. The party won 21.2% of votes, a loss of 5.7 percentage points, its worst ever result. Nonetheless, it remained the second largest party and largest opposition party. In the new National Council, Rendi-Wagner became foreign policy spokeswoman for the SP√ñ. She also became chairwoman of the foreign affairs committee, and joined the standing subcommittee of the joint committee.In February 2020, the SP√ñ announced a survey of party members to gauge their confidence in Rendi-Wagner and their opinion on key issues of social democracy. The survey was completed on 2 April, though the review of results was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were announced on 6 May: with a participation rate of 41.3%, Rendi-Wagner received 71.4% approval, and therefore announced that she would remain party leader. She presented a platform concept titled ""New Solidarity for Austria"", which seeks to the strengthen of the welfare state, with a focus on health and care, as well as investments in employment and tax justice.
A January 2021 poll indicated that Rendi-Wagner was the most popular politician in Austria, with 36% public approval. This was higher than Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (35%) and health minister Rudolf Anschober (32%).During the late 2021 political crisis which saw the resignation and subsequent retirement of Sebastian Kurz, Rendi-Wagner accused the government of being ""preoccupied with itself"" during the pandemic, and void of any mandate to continue in office. She called for new elections to be held once the fourth wave had been suppressed.Rendi-Wagner was the first SP√ñ-leader to face a leadership election in mid-2023.
The results of the membership election were announced on 22 May 2023 and Rendi-Wagner came in third and last place with 31.35% of the votes.Following the results of the election, on 23 May 2023, Rendi-Wagner announced that she won't be a candidate at the extraordinary party congress on 3 June 2023 and subsequently announced her orderly resignation as party leader and parliamentary group leader. She will remain in office until a new party leader and parliamentary group leader have been elected. At the party congress on 3 June 2023 according to the first count, Babler lost with 279 votes (46.81%) against Hans Peter Doskozil who received 316 (53.02%) of the delegates votes; however, after a recount showed that the results were incorrectly tabulated, with Babler having won the votes attributed to Doskozil, Babler was proclaimed the winner and declared new Chair of the Social Democratic Party of Austria.

57,"Susanne Riess (born 3 January 1961 in Braunau am Inn) is a former Austrian politician of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ). Riess-Passer is now CEO of the W√ºstenrot-Gruppe.


== Career ==
In the first government headed by Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, which was inaugurated in 2000, she became Vice Chancellor and minister of public services and sports, representing her party in the coalition with Sch√ºssel's Austrian People's Party (√ñVP). The Freedom Party had finished second in the 1999 election, so its leader, J√∂rg Haider, should have become Chancellor in any coalition with the √ñVP which finished third.  However, Haider yielded to Sch√ºssel in order to appease international opinion.  Although this should have put him in line to become Vice-Chancellor, he realised he was too controversial to have any role in the government. He thus resigned as party leader in favour of Riess-Passer, who had been FP√ñ managing chairwoman since 1996.
In the course of the formation of the government in 2000, she became chairwoman and leader of the FP√ñ.  She was known for being loyal to Haider, which earned her the nickname K√∂nigskobra (King Cobra).After severe disagreements with her former political mentor Haider in Summer 2002 (the so-called Knittelfeld Putsch), she resigned from all of her posts, as did finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser and the party spokesman in parliament, Peter Westenthaler.  After the 2002 elections, she remained Vice Chancellor on a provisional basis until the coalition between √ñVP and FP√ñ was renewed in early 2003, and has since had no involvement in politics.
Since 2004, Riess-Passer has been the CEO of the W√ºstenrot-Gruppe. Riess-Hahn was also on the advisory board of the later bancrupt Signa Holding.

Barbara Rosenkranz was the candidate of the Freedom Party for the 2010 Austrian presidential election. Her candidacy was officially presented by the Freedom Party on 2 March 2010. The Kronen Zeitung, the largest newspaper of Austria, supported her candidacy in articles written by its publisher Hans Dichand. The conservative party, the Austrian People's Party, didn't nominate a candidate (their last presidential candidate was Benita Ferrero-Waldner in 2004, who narrowly lost to Heinz Fischer), but refused to endorse any of the two major candidates, incumbent social democrat Heinz Fischer and Barbara Rosenkranz.
Rosenkranz received 15.6% of the vote, coming second after Fischer. A third candidate, Rudolf Gehring of the small Christian Party, polled 6%. The voter turnout was only 53.6%, however (compared to 70.8% in 2004, and the lowest in modern history).

=== Views on the European Union ===
Barbara Rosenkranz is critical of the European Union. She advocates a decentralized Europe and nation states. She also advocates the reintroduction of border controls.


=== Views on national socialism ===
Rosenkranz' husband, Horst Rosenkranz is a publisher of far right material and was formerly a member of the now-banned National Democratic Party (NDP), a far right party, and the question of whether she shares her husband's beliefs has caused some controversy.  Some Austrian media have referred to Rosenkranz as ""Reich Mother"".
In 1995 Rosenkranz brought a defamation case against the publicist Hans-Henning Scharsach for referring to her as an example of a ""Kellernazi"", that is, a closet sympathizer of National Socialist beliefs.  The lawsuit led to a fine against Scharsach's newspaper, ""News"".  This decision was criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, however, as a violation of freedom of speech, as they considered it a matter of opinion, and that Rosenkranz's attitude towards the Nazi past was thoroughly ambiguous.  Key points in this ruling were that she had never distanced herself from her husband's activities in the extreme right, and that in the past had been a vocal public opponent of the Verbotsgesetz 1947 law banning Holocaust denial. Both Scharsach and ""News"" were awarded damages.When once asked whether she believed in the existence of gas chambers in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II in an interview with Austrian Radio (ORF), she replied that she has the knowledge of an Austrian ""who went to school in Austria between 1964 and 1976 -- so that is my knowledge of history and I have no plan whatsoever to change it"". As this answer was criticised as being ""evasive"", she later stated in an interview with Die Presse, that there is no doubt that terrible crimes were committed during the Nazi regime.Historian Lothar H√∂belt, head of the supporting committee for Rosenkranz, criticized the media of a ""manipulating campaign"" against her, and argued that some of these statements were several years old or taken out of context.


== Personal life ==
Barbara Rosenkranz is married to Horst Rosenkranz, and has 10 children, 6 girls and 4 boys. She studied history and philosophy at the University of Vienna, but didn't graduate. Although raised as a Catholic, she has criticised the church authorities in Austria, and left the Church several years ago. None of her children are baptized.

77,"Antonia Albert (born 1989 or 1990 (age 33‚Äì34)) is an Austrian business economist and entrepreneur. In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in Berlin, Germany as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.


== Careship ==
When Albert's grandmother became sick in 2014, her family had great difficulty finding a suitable caregiver. In response, she co-founded the startup Careship with her brother Nikolaus Albert to create a virtual marketplace for in-home senior care. Careship uses an online ‚Äúmatchmaking algorithm‚Äù to connect families needing senior care with qualified self-employed caregivers. Caregivers can help with common tasks such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. On the platform, caregivers set their own price and Careship handles billing and coordinating insurance payments.Albert and her brother raised $4 million in investor funding for Careship in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. The marketplace was initially only offered in Berlin but has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. They would like to expand into Austria in 2018.The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial. Product testing organization Stiftung Warentest examined cleaning services in October 2014 and came to the conclusion that the service matched the online promise only in four out of ten cases.

Albert is from Vienna, Austria. She studied business administration in the Netherlands and Switzerland, receiving a BSc in International Business Administration in 2012 and a MSc in Strategic Management in 2013.
