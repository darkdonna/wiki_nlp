0,"Antonia Albert (born 1989 or 1990 (age 33–34)) is an Austrian business economist and entrepreneur. In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in Berlin, Germany as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.


== Careship ==
When Albert's grandmother became sick in 2014, her family had great difficulty finding a suitable caregiver. In response, she co-founded the startup Careship with her brother Nikolaus Albert to create a virtual marketplace for in-home senior care. Careship uses an online “matchmaking algorithm” to connect families needing senior care with qualified self-employed caregivers. Caregivers can help with common tasks such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. On the platform, caregivers set their own price and Careship handles billing and coordinating insurance payments.Albert and her brother raised $4 million in investor funding for Careship in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. The marketplace was initially only offered in Berlin but has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. They would like to expand into Austria in 2018.The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial. Product testing organization Stiftung Warentest examined cleaning services in October 2014 and came to the conclusion that the service matched the online promise only in four out of ten cases.


== Biography ==
Albert is from Vienna, Austria. She studied business administration in the Netherlands and Switzerland, receiving a BSc in International Business Administration in 2012 and a MSc in Strategic Management in 2013. Before co-founding Careship with her brother, she worked as a business economist for internet holding company Rocket Internet. Antonia was voted one of the 100 most Inspiring Women 2015 by BBC and was included on the 2018 Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list.

6,"Ingeborg J. Hochmair-Desoyer (born 1953) is an Austrian electrical engineer and the CEO and CTO of hearing implant company MED-EL. Dr Hochmair and her husband Prof. Erwin Hochmair co-created the first micro-electronic multi-channel cochlear implant in the world.  She received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for her contributions towards the development of the modern cochlear implant. She also received the 2015 Russ Prize for bioengineering.In 1989, she co-founded the medical device company MED-EL.


== Biography ==
Ingeborg Hochmair was born in 1953 in Vienna, Austria. Her mother was a physicist and her father was Dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Vienna University of Technology. Her grandmother was one of the first female chemical engineers in Austria.
She commenced her studies at Technical University of Vienna in electrical engineering in 1971, and in 1975, she became the first woman in Austria to receive a PhD in electrical engineering. Her dissertation was on the ""Technical realization and psychoacoustic evaluation of a system for multichannel chronic stimulation of the auditory nerve.""From 1976 to 1986, she worked as Assistant Professor at the Institute of General Electrical Engineering and Electronics at Technical University of Vienna. She also worked at Stanford University's Institute for Electronics in Medicine as a Visiting Associate Professor in 1979. In 1986, she moved from Vienna to Innsbruck, where she taught (first as Assistant Professor and later as Associate Professor) at the Institute of Applied Physics Electronics of University of Innsbruck until 1989. In 1998 she achieved Venia Legendi (Univ. Doz.) in Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Technical University of Vienna.In 1989, Hochmair co-founded the hearing implant company MED-EL, along with husband Erwin Hochmair. She remains CEO and CTO of the company.Outside of MED-EL, Hochmair continues to support research in the field of science and technology. In 2012, an endowed professorship in microelectronics and implantable systems was introduced at the University of Innsbruck’s Institute for Mechatronics, supported by Hochmair. The University of Innsbruck also offers Ingeborg Hochmair Professorships, an endowed professorship aimed at supporting female researchers in science and technology.


== Research & Other Work ==
In 1975, Ingeborg and Erwin Hochmair started the cochlear implant development at Technical University of Vienna with the overall goal of enabling the user not only to hear sounds but also to provide some speech understanding. Together they developed the world's first microelectronic multi-channel cochlear implant. This implant included a long, flexible electrode, which could, for the first time, deliver electric signals to the auditory nerve along a large part of the cochlea, the snail-shaped inner ear. Previous cochlear implant designs provided single-channel stimulation.  The new multi-channel device was implanted in December 1977 in Vienna by Dr Kurt Burian.In 1979, a modified version of this first device allowed a woman to understand words and sentences without lip-reading in a quiet environment via a small, body-worn sound processor. This was a major milestone in the development of modern cochlear implants. This device is the first to actually replace a human sense  Not only that, but it addresses hearing loss, which is number six on the list of the world's most significant disease burdensThrough MED-EL, Hochmair has led many further advances in hearing implant research, including the introduction of a behind-the-ear audio processor in 1991, new sound coding strategies, and the development of single-unit audio processors. A totally implantable cochlear implant is currently in development.Hochmair has over 40 patents to her name, all of which are for components of her cochlear implant. Many of the patents were updated or improved versions of older components for which she filed a new patent. A fairly comprehensive, but incomplete, list of her patents are as follows:

9,"Monisha Kaltenborn (née Narang; born 10 May 1971) is the Austrian former team principal of the Sauber Formula One team and held a 33.3% stake in the outfit, until it was taken over by Longbow Finance S.A. in July 2016. She was the team's chief executive officer from January 2010 until 22 June 2017. She was the first female team principal in Formula One.


== Career ==
Kaltenborn was born in Dehradun, India. Her family emigrated to Vienna when she was a child, and she took Austrian citizenship. From 1990 to 1995 she studied for a law degree at the University of Vienna. She then studied at London School of Economics and was awarded master's degree in International Business Law from University of London in 1996. Whilst still a student in Vienna, she worked for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the UN Commission for International Trade Law, and on completion of her studies she worked for various legal firms: first in Stuttgart with Gleiss Lutz; then back in Vienna with Wolf & Theis; and finally for the Fritz Kaiser Group in 1998–1999.
At this stage, Kaiser was a co-owner of the Sauber Formula One team (along with founder and team principal Peter Sauber and Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz), and Kaltenborn was employed to take charge of the team's corporate and legal affairs. By 2000, Kaiser had sold his shares, but Kaltenborn remained with the team as the head of its legal department. From 2001, she has been a member of its management board, and in early 2010, following the team's return to independent status following the withdrawal of former partner BMW, she was appointed CEO of Sauber Motorsport AG. She is also involved in the FIA's Commission for Women and Motorsport, under Michèle Mouton. On 16 May 2012, Peter Sauber transferred a third of the Sauber team to Kaltenborn, making her a part owner. In October, he retired from front-line management of the team, handing her the role of team principal.On 22 June 2017 Sauber F1 Team confirmed Kaltenborn would be leaving the Sauber Group effective immediately through a statement on their website:

Longbow Finance SA regrets to announce that, by mutual consent and due to diverging views of the future of the company, Monisha Kaltenborn will leave her positions with the Sauber Group effective immediately. We thank her for many years of strong leadership, great passion for the Sauber F1 Team and wish her the very best for the future. Her successor will be announced shortly; in the meantime we wish the team the best of luck in Azerbaijan.
In February 2018, Kaltenborn made a return to motorsport with the founding of KDC Racing, which made its racing debut in the Italian and ADAC Formula 4 championships. KDC is a fifty-fifty venture between Kaltenborn - the 'K' of the team's name - and French-Monegasque businesswoman Emily di Comberti, whose son Aaron competed in the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship in 2017.


== Personal life ==
In her first job in Stuttgart, Monisha met Jens Kaltenborn and later married him in Dehradun. They have two children and live in Küsnacht, which is close to the Sauber factory in Hinwil, Switzerland.

=== Parliamentary career ===
In 2007 the party chose Almaci to become the leader of the Antwerp constituency for the 2007 federal elections. Almaci was elected to the Belgian House of Representatives with 14,628 preferential votes. Almaci was appointed co-chair of the joint green caucus formed out of members of the Dutch-speaking party Groen and the francophone party Ecolo. Almaci shared this responsibility with the Ecolo-politicians Jean-Marc Nollet, Muriel Gerkens and Olivier Deleuze. 
On 6 July 2010, she took the oath of office for the second time as a member of the Chamber of Representatives for the Ecolo-Groen faction.

In the 2019 elections, she did not represent herself again for the Belgian federal parliament, but instead presented herself for the Flemish Parliament in the same Antwerp Constituency. She was elected with 50,848 preference votes.


==== Specializations ====
In addition to the annual budget control, Almaci mainly specialized in financial files and the government budget. She mainly drew attention during the banking crisis of 2008 and in particular in the so-called Dexia special committee. Almaci repeatedly asked for this 'Special Committee' to be turned into a committee with investigative powers to be able to demand the lead actors and have them testify under oath. The MPs of the ruling parties refused to do so. 
In the Chamber, Almaci was among others:

permanent member of the Subcommittee ""Court of Auditors"" of the Committee on Finance and the Budget;
permanent member of the special committee in charge of investigating the financial and banking crisis;
deputy of the special committee charged with investigating the circumstances which led to the dismantling of Dexia SA;

=== Party chairwoman ===
On September 21, 2014, Almaci applied to become party chairwoman of Groen. She took on Jeremie Vaneeckhout as a running mate. She competed against Elke Van den Brandt, at the time an MP in the Brussels Regional Parliament. On November 15, 2014, Almaci was elected president with 60% of the vote.In September 2019, it was announced that Almaci was running for a second term as party chairwoman, this time with Dany Neudt as candidate vice chair. She was re-elected with 53.2 percent of the vote.In March 2022, she announced her early retirement as chair. She said she wanted to spend more time with her family and for internal renewal, although since the start of her second term she has been increasingly confronted with internal criticism about the way she led the party. For example, there was some dissatisfaction about the fact that then caucus leader Kristof Calvo was passed over as minister when the new Belgian federal government was formed in October 2020. Pending the election of a new chairman, Almaci remained on as acting chairman. She continued to exercise her office as a Flemish Member of Parliament.

18,"Antonia Albert (born 1989 or 1990 (age 33–34)) is an Austrian business economist and entrepreneur. In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in Berlin, Germany as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.


== Careship ==
When Albert's grandmother became sick in 2014, her family had great difficulty finding a suitable caregiver. In response, she co-founded the startup Careship with her brother Nikolaus Albert to create a virtual marketplace for in-home senior care. Careship uses an online “matchmaking algorithm” to connect families needing senior care with qualified self-employed caregivers. Caregivers can help with common tasks such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. On the platform, caregivers set their own price and Careship handles billing and coordinating insurance payments.Albert and her brother raised $4 million in investor funding for Careship in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. The marketplace was initially only offered in Berlin but has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. They would like to expand into Austria in 2018.The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial. Product testing organization Stiftung Warentest examined cleaning services in October 2014 and came to the conclusion that the service matched the online promise only in four out of ten cases.


== Biography ==
Albert is from Vienna, Austria. She studied business administration in the Netherlands and Switzerland, receiving a BSc in International Business Administration in 2012 and a MSc in Strategic Management in 2013. Before co-founding Careship with her brother, she worked as a business economist for internet holding company Rocket Internet. Antonia was voted one of the 100 most Inspiring Women 2015 by BBC and was included on the 2018 Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list.

24,"Freya Van den Bossche (born 26 March 1975) is a Belgian (Flemish) politician and daughter of prominent former Belgian politician Luc Van den Bossche. She is member of the SP.a political party, and she was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget and Consumer Protection in the Belgian federal government. She was the youngest ever minister appointed in Belgium.


== Education and move into politics ==
Freya Van den Bossche followed her secondary education at the Royal Atheneum Voskenslaan in Ghent. She studied law from 1993 to 1995 at the University of Ghent, but did not obtain a degree, and ultimately graduated from the University of Ghent with a master's degree in Communication Sciences in 1999. From 1996 to 1997, she studied at the University of Amsterdam as part of an exchange programme.
In 2006, while she was vice-premier in the federal government, Knack, a prominent Flemish magazine in Belgium alleged that she had not written the obligatory thesis for her master's degree herself. Rather, due to the complexity of the thesis she submitted, Knack journalist Koen Meulenaere alleged that the thesis had actually been written by Frank De Moor, also a former Knack journalist and a friend of Freya Van den Bossche's father, the prominent socialist politician, Luc Van den Bossche. Knack posted a version of her thesis online, but offered no other proof. Freya Van den Bossche subsequently submitted a criminal complaint against Koen Meulenaere for slander and defamation. In response to a question posed by the Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws on whether she did in fact write her thesis, Ms. Van den Bossche replied: ""Would that make a difference? I can show you my notes because I have nothing to hide"". Knack ultimately removed the thesis from its website and ceased coverage of the matter.From 1999 to 2000, she found employment as an Attachée, responsible for communication and drug-related problems, of the then Mayer of Ghent Frank Beke.
Freya first came to national attention in Belgium in a televised debating competition between candidates in a municipal election who were the children of well-known politicians. She performed strongly in the debate and was considered by many to be very attractive and articulate. In addition, during the campaign her election advertising included a postcard of a black and white photograph that included her long bare legs that was quite revealing, showing a black slip. Partly as a result of these profile building exercises, Freya polled well and was elected in that municipal poll in 2000.


== Federal minister ==
She was quickly promoted and was put on her Social Democrat Party's list in East Flanders for the federal parliament in 2003, attracting 105,000 votes. On 12 July 2003, she was appointed the youngest minister in Belgium's history appointed aged 28 as Minister of Environment, Consumer Affairs and Sustainable Development in Government Verhofstadt II. In July 2004, she became responsible for Work and Consumer Affairs. After the departure of Johan Vande Lanotte in October 2005, she was again promoted, this time to become the nation's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget and Consumer Affairs. She lost that position in 2008, when the government fell.
In a recent poll she was rated as the seventh most popular politician in Belgium. A Spanish newspaper included her in an internet poll of the world's most beautiful female politicians.Time magazine wrote about her:But by the time she ran for national parliament as a Flemish Socialist (SP.A) candidate in 2003, the law required that both sexes be represented in the top three slots on every party list – so her name was placed in a vote-getting position no novice male would have enjoyed. And part of her popularity, it must be said, has to do with her bright blue eyes and throaty voice. Van den Bossche regularly pops up on ""sexiest Belgians"" lists. ""Some people assume I'm here because of my looks or because of parity laws,"" she says. ""My job is to prove them wrong. Maybe these factors have helped, but I hope that in four years, people will be talking about my policies.""


== Personal life ==
Van den Bossche has two daughters, Ariane (born 1999) and Billie (born on 30 June 2005), and one son, Moses (born on 29 November 2009). On 29 December 2006, Van den Bossche married Dennis Van de Weghe from Ghent, one of her former cabinet colleagues. The marriage did not last long, with the couple separating shortly after. She also has a son with Willem Wallyn.

She argues ""language is the basis for integration.” She has also argued the current Belgian model of social integration has deteriorated. She has also voiced opposition to Belgian politicians of Turkish descent performing military service in Turkey, arguing that it implies split loyalties and is a potential security risk, and believes politicians in ministerial posts should not hold multiple citizenships.  She has described herself as ""100 percent Flemish with Kurdish roots."".In 2016, she participated in the television documentary Back to their own country with other well-known Belgian politicians and celebrities in which the group travelled with journalist Martin Heylen to conflict areas and follows the refugee route to Europe. Following her participation, she urged Europe to persuade Syrians not to come and for tougher action against human traffickers. She argued ""The refugees are received in inhumane conditions, I would also leave in their place. Only, I am concerned about the preservation of our social security system. What are we going to do with all those newcomers when there are already so many unemployed people who do speak Dutch?” She has argued that refugees are better supported in their own region as opposed to coming to Belgium where she states there are limited employment and integration structures.In 2017, she was accused by the Turkish press of supporting terrorism and of being a member of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).Demir has received death threats as a result of her opposition to Turkey's treatment of its Kurdish population. In 2017 a man was sentenced to 6 months in prison for making threats against her.

Demir responded that she would not be ""intimidated"" by the stunt. In November 2020, Demir received death and rape threats via email after she wrote a Facebook post criticising Diyanet (Directorate of Religious Affairs) funding and training of imams in mosques in Belgium. Demir described the Turkish Diyanet directorate as ""Erdogan's long arm"" and ""the antennae of the Erdogan regime.""

In a 2018 interview with Le Soir, Khattabi called for a ""new model"" for Brussels without separate Flemish and Francophone communities. That same year following the killing of 14 women from macho violence in Belgium that year, Khattabi called for the recognition of femicide.Under Khattabi's co-presidency, Ecolo made large gains in Brussels in the local elections of 2018 to become the second largest party there.

At the age of 30 she was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives.Her father, Gaston Onkelinx, originally a Dutch-speaking migrant from Flemish Limburg to francophone Wallonia, has long been mayor of Seraing (near Liège) and member of the House of Representatives (1974–1987).

== Controversy ==
When Turkish terrorist Fehriye Erdal was sentenced to four years imprisonment by a Bruges court on 28 February 2006, it turned out that she had shaken off the Belgian secret service, which had the responsibility of following her since 23 February 2006 (Erdal had been under house arrest since 2000, and living in the same building as the DHKP-C secretariat). Both Laurette Onkelinx and Minister of the Interior Patrick Dewael came under fire for this incident; the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V) and Vlaams Belang demanded the resignation of both of them on 6 March 2006.
In July 2006, Onkelinx came under heavy political fire again when one of Belgian's most notorious criminals, Murat Kaplan, did not return from a weekend-leave, which she had signed off. In August 2006 she came again under heavy fire when 28 prisoners managed to escape from a prison in Dendermonde. In September 2006, it was reported that the criminal Victor Hoxha had returned to Belgium – he had been deported from Belgium earlier in 2006, and told not to return for ten years. Prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD), asked the minister to refrain from releasing any criminals prematurely in the coming three months, but she refused this demand. This came just before the government was to prepare its budget for the coming year, and the October municipal elections.
CD&V and Vlaams Belang again called for the resignation of the minister, but it was unknown how far the VLD would go in supporting the minister (and accordingly, the then current federal government). On 23 September, it was reported that another criminal did not return from day-leave. Tony Van Parys, of the CD&V party, called it ""incomprehensible that someone like Azzouzi [the criminal in question] would get penitentiary leave."" The cabinet's crisis was averted the next week, when a deal was struck between the VLD and PS, allowing criminals only to be released on parole, in the next months, after consent by their victim (or the victim's family).
On 6 October, two days before the Belgian municipal elections, Laurette Onkelinx was hit with a pie at an election event in Schaerbeek. The perpetrator was Benito Franscesconi, a 78-year-old man, who has a history of ""civil disobedience."" Franscesconi has made himself a civil party to many court cases in which he had no direct interest.
First married to Abbès Guenned, a Belgian of Moroccan descent, Onkelinx divorced him in 1997–1998; Morocco asked for Guenned's extradition, accusing him of drug trafficking (he was stopped on 31 July 1997 at Zaventem airport, while in possession of a diplomatic passport), a charge which was later dropped. He was also arrested in Turkey, but released after strong influence from the Belgian government. At that time, Onkelinx was presiding over the government of Belgium's French Community. Onkelinx then married barrister Marc Uyttendaele. Witnesses to this marriage were both their former husband and wife. In 2003, Guenned became an adviser to Onkelinx' cabinet, charged with the preparation of the election of the Belgian advisory Muslim council, and dealing with town management but, especially, with communication between the cabinet and the Islamic associations.
In 2009, Onkelinx criticized Pope Benedict XVI over his comments that the distribution of condoms without prior education only worsened the AIDS crisis.In 2014, it was revealed that her Ministry had hired the firm of her own husband, Marc Uyttendaele, as a legal consultant, at a cost of 245,000 euros.On 13 September 2017, Onkelincx announced she would not be a candidate for the 2019 elections.

== Political positions ==


=== Armenian Genocide denial ===
Ozdemir was expelled from her party, the Humanist Democratic Centre on 29 May 2015 because she denied the Armenian Genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire was a genocide. She also didn't attend a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the Armenian genocide in parliament, defending herself that there were no court rulings that undermined the Armenian claims. Ozdemir claimed this to be freedom of speech. This is against the party’s deontological bylaws and CDH Chairman Benoit Lutgen had formerly stated that all genocide deniers within the party would be expelled. In protest of this decision, two other members of the cdH, one of them the brother of Mahinur, also left the party, alleging the party underwent a shift to the right. Ozdemir immediately received support from the Justice and Development (AKP) Party office in Brussels. There also was a demonstration in support of Ozdemir by the AKP-affiliated UEDT, beginning at the headquarters of her former party and ending at the Turkish embassy.
