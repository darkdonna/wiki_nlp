In 2004, Noël Mamère, the mayor of Bègles in the suburbs of Bordeaux, disobeyed French law and conducted the first gay marriage as an act of defiance. The Mayor and the gay couple were subsequently sued; Caroline Mécary defended them. The marriage was annulled despite their efforts but they managed to successfully raise the question of gay marriage.
In 2010, along with SOS Homophobie and APGL (Association des parents et futurs parents gays et lesbiens) she represented a lesbian couple before the French constitutional court (which decides if any law is constitutional and in conformity with French law). The couple wished to get married, but under French law they had no legal right to marriage.

30,"Jacline Mouraud (born 24 April 1967) is a French activist credited as being one of the founders of the yellow vest movement. She rose to national attention as a result of a viral Facebook video she posted in October 2018 about France's proposed eco-tax to which she was opposed. Mouraud quickly found herself on regional and national television debating French MPs. Mouraud slowly became a divisive figure in the movement, being criticized by other yellow vest activists including Priscilla Ludosky and Eric Drouet, and the French media who have accused her of sharing of ""fake news"".
Despite having previously stated she was apolitical, Mouraud created Les Émergents (English: The Rising) in January 2019 with the intention of running candidates to run in France's local elections in 2020. The party was to be neither left nor right, and Mouraud did not necessarily see herself as being included on the candidate list.
Mouraud is a proponent of pseudosciences. When the yellow vest movement started in November 2018, she primarily made a living as a ""hypnotherapist, metapsychist, and parapsychologist "". She has operated a paranormal and ectoplasm center since 2013 in Morbihan. She is also a composer and accordion player, who has played in dance halls, music venues and music festivals.


== Yellow vest movement ==
According to The Guardian, Mouraud has been ""widely credited with starting the yellow vests movement"" (French: gilets jaunes). Mouraud visibility in the movement came as a surprise to her and others. Her involvement in the movement began in October 2018 when she posted a Facebook video that went viral about France's proposed eco-tax to which she was opposed. The video was 4 minutes and 38 seconds in length, and has over 6 million views. In it, she asked French President Emmanuel Macron: ""What are you doing with the money apart from buying new dishes at the Élysée Palace and building yourself swimming pools?"" The video was not her first of its kind, with Mouraud having made a similar one at the very beginning of the French presidential elections in April 2017.Mouraud quickly found herself on regional and national television debating French MPs, representing the average person impacted by France's new fuel laws after her video went viral.In November 2018, Mouraud lodged a complaint with the police as a result of defamatory statements made against her and threats she had received from her participation in the yellow vest movement. The defamatory and threatening materials were left in her mailbox. In early December, she was part of a delegation of yellow vest protesters who met with France's Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. In December 2018, Mouraud criticized what she saw as extremists who were trying to hijack the movement through violence. She later backed away from protests, instead preferring to see what she saw as a political solution to France's problems. In February 2019, she denounced statements by members of the Italian government about the yellow vest movement, viewing these statements as serious interference into France's domestic political scene.Mouraud was criticized by Priscilla Ludosky and Eric Drouet in mid-January 2019 of being in the movement in order to hijack it for her own personal and political ambitions. The media has also been highly critical of Mouraud for her comments about the paranormal and ectoplasm. Mouraud is also at times a polarizing figure among others in the yellow vest movement. Some of the criticism is a result of her sharing of ""fake news"", for which she has been called out for by media organizations such as 20 minutes.Following Act XIV on 16 February 2019, in response to anti-semitic acts during Saturday's march in Paris, there was an open letter asking Priscillia Ludosky, Mouraud, Ingrid Levavasseur, Drouet, Maxime Nicolle and other yellow vest spokespeople ""to condemn the aggression committed against Alain Finkielkraut and the antisemitic remarks of which he was the victim.""


== Les Émergents ==
Early on, as part of Mouraud's involvement in what eventually became the yellow vest movement, she claimed to be apolitical. In October 2018, she claimed this because of her belief that all politicians were corrupt.In January 2019, Mouraud created Les Émergents (English: The Risen), a political party that grew out of the yellow vest movement, with the intention of running candidates to run in France's local elections in 2020, sitting out the 2019 European Parliament elections. She stated that the party ""won’t be rightwing or leftwing"". Her platform for the party includes making a stronger parliament by weakening the powers of the executive, and to bring pay equity between men and women. Her platform is also concerned with climate change and the ""cult of consumerism"". She announced the creation of the party at a press conference in Orléans. She delayed naming the location of the press conference out of fear that it would be disrupted by others in the officially leaderless yellow vest movement.Mouraud's proposed list for 2020 is to be headed by Ingrid Levavasseur, another well known yellow vest activist. The list emerged from the group Citizen Initiative Rally (French: Ralliement d’initiative citoyenne). Mouraud did not necessarily see herself as being part of that list.


== Music ==
Mouraud is a composer and accordion player. She has seen her purpose as to bring joy to people through music. She has worked in dance halls and music venues. She has also played at music festivals. In 2014, Mouraud received extensive local news coverage after creating a composition for a proposed new French national anthem.


== Background ==
She was born on 24 April 1967 in Guérande. She attended Ecole Saint Gildas in Marzan from 1970 to 1978. She next attended College Saint Joseph La Roche-Bernard from 1978 to 1982. After that she attended Lycée Aristide Briand in Saint Nazaire from 1982 to 1986.Mouraud is a hypnotherapist, metapsychist, and parapsychologist. In 2013, she opened a paranormal and ectoplasm center with a friend. In 2018, she was working in Morbihan as a hypnotherapist. Sessions she conducts include helping to get people to stop smoking.

== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Obono was born on 12 July 1980 in Libreville, Gabon to a prominent Gabonese family. She is the daughter of Hortense Simbou Mbadinga, a secretary at Air Gabon; and Martin Edzodzomo-Ela, an economist who was a senior executive at the Paribas-Gabon bank from 1975 to 1979 before he was dismissed for his opposition to the regime of Omar Bongo, who was also a candidate in the Gabonese presidential election of 1998. She lived in Gabon until she was about ten years old, before she attended university in Montpellier. She became a naturalised French citizen in 2011.After graduating from university, Obono became a librarian in Paris. In 2002, she obtained a master's degree in history at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, studying the economic relationship between France and Gabon during the second half of the 20th century under the supervision of Jacques Marseille.

Shortly after her election, Danièle Obono declared herself to be an alterglobalist, afrofeminist (Black feminism), anti-imperialist, anti-racist, anti-liberal, anti-Islamophobe and pan-Africanist. She also humorously defines herself as a ""Bolsho-Trotsko-Marxist"", from Trotskyism and Marxism (""I have fun claiming these 'isms' when we're told there's no such thing as ideology anymore.""), and adds that although ""Leninism was [her] gateway [...], anarchists are allies.


=== Parliamentary activity ===
Secretary of the Delegation for Overseas France  and vice-chair of the study group on discrimination and LGBTQI-phobia in the world, she chairs the France-Bangladesh friendship group.Opposed to the 2018 Asylum and Immigration Act, she considers it to be ""useless, counterproductive and dangerous"", as it ""separates good migrants from bad ones, exiles to be kept from exiles to be expelled "". On the other hand, the government and Interior Minister Gérard Collomb defend the bill in the name of ""stepping up the fight against illegal immigration"".In a written question to the government in December 2018, she gave her support to Biram Dah Abeid, ""an anti-slavery figure in Mauritania"". On December 3, 2019, as a member of the Law Commission, she tabled a bill on ""stabilising and securing funding and jobs within associations"", which aims to define the subsidy as a ""funding contract standard"" and to extend the powers of the Haut Conseil à la vie associative (High Council for Associative Life) in response to the decline in the number of employees in the associative sector.
In September 2020, she co-signed a bill from the Ecology Democracy Solidarity parliamentary group aimed at strengthening the right to abortion.As part of the France insoumise parliamentary niche in 2021, Danièle Obono defended a proposal for a job guarantee, which should enable any unemployed person who wants to work to have a job paying the basic public sector wage or more. According to the MEP, this system should make it possible to link an ""ecological bifurcation"" with ""social progress"". However, the proposal has been the subject of debate, with Fabien Roussel, national secretary of the PCF, describing it as a ""Soviet-era"" philosophy. The economist Henrik Sterdyniak felt that the measure ""could not meet the actual needs of households"" with jobs of ""mediocre quality. In June 2021, she lent her support to the local residents of the Jardin d’Eole, who organised a demonstration every Wednesday to denounce the situation in the neighbourhood because of the insecurity created by the presence of drug addicts.

She was sworn in on 27 July 2022.


== Controversies ==


=== About freedom of expression ===


==== Pétition of the ""Inrockuptibles"" for artists ====
On 21 June 2017, Danièle Obono was invited to the TV Show called Les Grandes Gueules, in which Alain Marshall blamed her for  a petition signed in 2012 and launched by the cultural magazine Les Inrockuptibles in support of artists' freedom of expression. The petition denounced the indictment of Saïdou, lead singer of the group « Zone d'expression populaire » (ZEP, eng: area of people’s speech), and sociologist Saïd Bouamama following a complaint from the far-right association AGRIF, which criticised the use of the expression ""Nique la France"" in a 2010 song.Danièle Obono explained why she had signed up five years earlier: ""To defend the freedom of expression of these artists, yes. Because that's one of the fundamental freedoms.""Political scientist Laurent Bouvet and Valeurs actuelles portrayed her as being close to another signatory, Houria Bouteldja, a member of the Indigènes de la République, which she disputes. After comments from the far right on her response, a petition against her gathered 5,000 signatures in what Les Inrockuptibles described as a ""polemic with racist overtones"". LFI MP Éric Coquerel expressed surprise that the question had been put specifically to her, because of her skin colour, and not to others who had signed the petition five years earlier, such as Clémentine Autain, Noël Mamère and Eva Joly, but also artists Rachid Taha, Zebda and Siné, trade unionists Élie Domota and Xavier Mathieu and journalist Rokhaya Diallo. On 11 December 2018, the French Supreme Court definitively dismissed all AGRIF's claims against the song.


==== Debate with Manuel Valls ====
In October 2017, a controversy over freedom of expression pitted Obono against Manuel Valls, faced with the appeal of Farida Amrani, LFI candidate narrowly beaten in the legislative elections in the constituency including Évry, a town where Dieudonné had obtained 3.84% in the first round of the 2017 French legislative election.On Europe 1, Valls attributes the following comments to Obono: ""the text she wrote after the attacks of January 2015 (...) when she says that she rather cried for Dieudonné and not for Charlie's victims"". The journalist Patrick Cohen then points out to him that this text is more of a lament, in his view, about the censorship that struck Dieudonné at the end of 2013 than about Dieudonné himself.On November 5, Danièle Obono responded to this controversy on Radio J. She criticized Dieudonné because he was ""racist and anti-Semitic"". Her statement was taken up by AFP, immediately recalling that she had been ""accused of Islamo-leftist drift by Manuel Valls"" and observing that she refers ""to the numerous press releases from the Human Rights League"" for whom the ban on Dieudonné's shows constitutes ""a serious setback to the rule of law, which allows this person to present himself as a victim"".


== Political career ==
Following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, Obono was at the centre of a controversy after she stated she would ""not cry"", deeming the weekly newspaper's cartoons ""racist"".A member of La France Insoumise, Obono was elected to the National Assembly for the 17th constituency of Paris in the legislative election of 2017. She was a spokesperson for La France Insoumise under the leadership Jean-Luc Mélenchon, together with Alexis Corbière.In the legislature, Obono has served on the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.In November 2017, she was involved in another controversy after she defended union meetings in Seine-Saint-Denis that were closed to white people. After the government announced it would sue the organisers, Obono had an altercation with Mélenchon in the National Assembly, following his support of the government on this matter.In August 2020, the right-wing French magazine Valeurs actuelles published a seven-page fantasy story and illustrations of Obono as a slave in chains facing the sunset, shackled beside a fire, under the title ""summer fantasy story"", prompting an outcry from politicians of various parties.Questioned about Hamas following the terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023, Danielle Obono, told French radio Sud Radio on 17 October that ""yes, Hamas is a resistance movement. It's an Islamist political group that has an armed wing, and is resisting Israel », refusing to qualify it a terrorist organization.

This political proposal was part of La France insoumise program since 2012. the parliamentary group then led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon made a few unsuccessful intents to set it to the National Assembly agenda in 2018 and 2019. But after the shock caused by the Supreme Court overruling Roe v. Wade in the United-States of America , Mathilde Panot proposed it again on July 2022, forcing it into the agenda through her group's niche parlementaire (once every year each parliamentary group can decide of the session agenda).

This opinion is supported by the fact that white people don't face structural racism (or systemic racism), they don't get discriminated to access housing and jobs, they don't get assaulted or insulted near as much as coloured people in French society.

62,"Florence Parly (French pronunciation: [flɔʁɑ̃s paʁli]; born 8 May 1963) is a French politician who served as Minister of the Armed Forces under President Emmanuel Macron from 2017 to 2022. A former member of the Socialist Party (PS), she previously served as Secretary of State for the Budget from 2000 to 2002 under President Jacques Chirac.


== Career ==
An alumna of Sciences Po and the École nationale d'administration, Parly was appointed Secretary of State for the Budget on 3 January 2000 in the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In office until 6 May 2002, she seconded Christian Sautter, then Laurent Fabius at the Ministry of Finance.After briefly serving as a member of the Burgundy Regional Council from 2004 to 2006, Parly worked at Air France as deputy general director from 2006 until 2014, where she was in charge of passenger activity at Orly Airport and stopovers in France.In 2014, Parly moved on to become director-general of SNCF Voyageurs until 2017.


=== Minister of the Armies ===
Parly was named Minister of the Armies on 21 June 2017 after Sylvie Goulard was forced to resign due to an ongoing investigation of her party. Following the nomination, she resigned from all her board positions; her husband Martin Vial withdrew from his position on the board of Thales Group.


==== Internal investigations ====
Shortly after taking office, Parly ordered an investigation into allegations brought forward by the satirical weekly Le Canard enchaîné that the acting head of the French Air Force borrowed a Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet on weekends to fly from his base in Bordeaux to his home in Provence.In 2020, Parly placed a French lieutenant colonel, based in Italy and stationed with NATO, under investigation over a suspected breach of security after having passed sensitive documents to the Russian secret services.


==== International crises ====
Regarding the Iran Nuclear Deal, Parly told BFM TV in 2019 that ""nothing would be worse than Iran leaving this deal. We absolutely want to keep this agreement alive"". Following the US-led Baghdad airstrike in January 2020 that killed Iranian Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani, Parly rejected pressure to withdraw French troops from Iraq, even stating on her Twitter account that France had already reinforced security for its 160 soldiers stationed in Iraq.  She further reiterated that it was the French government's priority to fight against ISIS militants, who were re-merging in the area. Parly also warned Iran not to escalate tensions.Under Parly's leadership, France joined military exercises with Italy, Greece and Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean amid a worsening dispute between Turkey and Greece over energy resources in the region in 2020. During that conflict, Parly underlined that France would stand by Greece and Cyprus. On her initiative, NATO investigated French accusations that the Turkish Naval Forces failed to respond to an allied call to inspect a vessel in the Mediterranean, an incident suspected to involve Turkish arms smuggling to Libya.By mid-2021, Parly oversaw the phase-out of Operation Barkhane with some 5,100 soldiers across the Sahel region, and its transition into the Takuba Task Force. As part of Operation Barkhane, she also authorized the killing of al Qaeda leader Baye ag Bakabo in June 2021; Bakabo had been determined the chief suspect for having abducted and shot Radio France Internationale journalists Claude Verlon and Ghislaine Dupont in November 2013.The announcement of the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia in September 2021 sparked a period of diplomatic tensions in French-American and French-Australian relations. The French government received official notification from Australia that the Attack-class submarine project, involving a A$90 billion Australian contract to buy 12 French submarines, was to be cancelled only a few hours before it was publicly announced. In a joint statement, Parly and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed disappointment at Australia's decision to abandon their joint submarine program with France.Parly's tenure as Armed Forces Minister was marked by the 2021 Tribune des généraux published in Valeurs actuelles, which spanned talk of a coup d'état after tens of retired army officers openly criticised Macron's leadership in the fight against Islamism and warned of a possible civil war.


==== Military procurement ====
In 2022, Parly led talks with Ministry of Defense Prabowo Subianto over Indonesia´s decision to order 42 Dassault Rafale fighter jets in a $8.1 billion deal, making Jakarta the biggest French arms client in the Indo-Pacific region.

A member of The Republicans, she previously served as Minister of Higher Education and Research from 2007 to 2011 and Minister of the Budget and Government Spokeswoman from 2011 to 2012 under Prime Minister François Fillon. Pécresse represented the 2nd constituency of Yvelines in the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007 and again from 2012 until 2016.
Pécresse was voted as the Republicans' nominee for the 2022 French presidential election, defeating Éric Ciotti in the party primary. She came fifth in the election with 4.8% of the vote, the worst result in the history of her party or its Gaullist predecessors.


== Education and early career ==
Pécresse is the daughter of prominent economist Dominique Roux who taught at Université Paris Dauphine and later served as CEO of Bolloré. She has degrees from HEC Paris and the École nationale d'administration. She speaks French, English, Russian and Japanese.Pécresse was an auditor of the Conseil d'État until 1998, when she was designated councillor to President Jacques Chirac.


== Political career ==


=== Career in local politics ===
In 2004, she took office as a regional councillor of Île-de-France. She was also the spokeswoman of the Union for a Popular Movement party in Yvelines. In 2020, she took office as a municipal councillor of Vélizy-Villacoublay.


=== Career in national politics ===
In addition to her activities in regional politics, Pécresse served as a member of the National Assembly of France from 2002 until 2007, representing the Yvelines department (2nd constituency). In Parliament, she was a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (2002–2005) and the Committee on Cultural Affairs (2005–2007). In 2004, she became the spokeswoman for Nicolas Sarkozy, who was then leader of the UMP.From 2007 until 2011, Pécresse served as Minister of Higher Education and Research in the cabinet of Prime Minister François Fillon. During her time in office, she launched many reforms in an effort to give universities a greater degree of autonomy over their resources and open the way for more private sector financing. The reforms caused a wave of strikes.In 2009, the Académie de la Carpette anglaise, an organisation that opposes the spread of the English language in Francophone countries, gave Pécresse the Prix de la Carpette Anglaise (""English Doormat Prize"") for having refused to speak French at international meetings in Brussels, Belgium; Pécresse had stated that English was the easiest means of communication.At the same time, Pécresse was described by the Financial Times as one of the most successful of Sarkozy's ministers and considered as a candidate to succeed Christine Lagarde as Minister of the Economy and Finance in 2011.From 2011 until 2012, Pécresse served as the government's spokeswoman and as Minister of Budget, Public Accounts and State Reform in Fillon's third cabinet, succeeding François Baroin. In this capacity, she opposed increases in the EU budget for 2013. In the 2011 local elections, she notably went against official party line, led by then UMP leader Jean-François Copé, not to direct the party's supporters how to vote; instead, she said she would rather vote for the Socialist Party (PS) in the case of a runoff against the National Front (FN).After the defeat of Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, Pécresse remained a key member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and its successor, the Republicans (LR). She returned to the National Assembly, where she served on the Finance Committee from 2012 until 2016. In September 2014, she joined Fillon, Étienne Blanc, Éric Ciotti and Pierre Lellouche on an official trip to Iraq.


=== President of the Regional Council of Île-de-France ===
In December 2015, Pécresse led a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, which narrowly won the Île-de-France regional election, defeating the Union of the Left, a coalition of socialists and ecologists. She became the first woman to hold the office of president of the Regional Council of Île-de-France.
In the party's 2016 presidential primaries Pécresse endorsed former prime minister Alain Juppé. Amid the Fillon affair, in March 2017, she joined Xavier Bertrand, Christian Estrosi and others in calling for Juppé to replace François Fillon as the party's candidate.Ahead of the Republicans' 2017 leadership elections, Pécresse founded her own political movement Libres! in July 2017. She also publicly opposed newly elected LR chairman Laurent Wauquiez, warning against his possible ""porosity"" to the far-right National Front's (FN) ideas. She later announced her resignation from LR on 5 June 2019, three days after Wauquiez's resignation from the presidency of the party.In response to the Brexit vote in 2016, Pécresse helped launch an initiative of corporate leaders and politicians – including Anne Hidalgo, Gérard Mestrallet and Christian Noyer – to attract business from London. She has since been saying publicly that France was rolling out the ""red-white-and-blue carpet"" for UK bankers.In 2019, Pécresse announced plans to boost the number of people in the Paris region who cycle to work by investing 100 million euros in new cycle lanes and infrastructure and a subsidized electric bike rental scheme before 2021.


=== Candidacy for 2022 presidential election ===

In July 2021, Pécresse announced her intention to run as the Republican candidate in the 2022 presidential election. In an interview with Le Figaro, she said: ""I am ready to be the first woman president of the Republic."" At the party's congress in November 2021, she came in second after Éric Ciotti in an internal vote; for the runoff election, she was endorsed by the other defeated candidates Michel Barnier, Xavier Bertrand and Philippe Juvin. On 4 December 2021, she won the Republican candidacy in the final round of voting with 61 percent of ballots cast by party members, the first woman to be so nominated; Ciotti polled 39 percent. She appointed Sonia Petro, a politician from Guadeloupe as Overseas Speaker during her campaign.After winning the nomination, Pécresse's polling numbers soared above those of far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour, though trailing incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the first round. From the end of December, Pécresse and Le Pen were close together in polls for second place in the first round, to advance into the second round behind Macron.In January 2022, Pécresse said that France should metaphorically use a Kärcher pressure washer against crime in banlieues; the same argument had been used by Sarkozy in 2005. The German corporation said that it did not want to be used in political discourse. In February, some of her aides including Éric Woerth and Natacha Bouchart left her campaign and endorsed Macron.At a rally in February, Pécresse said ""in ten years time … will we be a sovereign nation, a U.S. satellite or a Chinese trading post? Will we be unified or divided? Nothing is written, whether it's loss of economic status, or the Great Replacement"". She was criticised for referring to the Great Replacement, and later said that her mention was not an endorsement of what she considered to be a ""theory of hate"". In addition to this statement, her rally was ridiculed by members of her own party, who perceived her delivery as awkward and likened the rally to the sinking of the Titanic.By March 2022, Pécresse was polling in fifth place for the first round, behind Macron, Zemmour, Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon. She finished in fifth place with 1,679,470 votes (4.8%), the worst-ever result for the Republicans or its Gaullist predecessors. She then endorsed Macron for the second round. Pécresse received slightly less than the 5% threshold to be reimbursed by the state for her campaign; she said that her campaign had cost €7 million, of which €5 million was her personal responsibility. She then announced a plan to crowdfund the paying of her debts.


== Political positions ==


=== Social policy ===
Opposed to the Taubira bill on same-sex marriage in France, Pécresse participated in various demonstrations opposing same-sex marriage and LGBT parenting between 2012 and 2013, notably led by La Manif pour tous.In a 2016 op-ed published by Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, Pécresse joined sixteen other high-profile women from across the political spectrum – including Élisabeth Guigou, Christine Lagarde, and Fleur Pellerin – in making a public vow to expose ""all sexist remarks, inappropriate gestures and behaviour.""When founding Libres! in 2017, Pécresse told Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche she would seek to position her grouping between those who had joined Macron's government – including Prime Minister Édouard Philippe – and those who would follow a line she called ""aggressive opposition,"" and which has gathered around the party's right wing.Also in 2020, Pécresse said she was ""totally hostile"" to mail-in voting to facilitate voting during the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in France.In 2021, Pécresse advocated a more restrictive approach to the issue of immigration, seeing it as a ""major societal challenge"". In particular, she suggests the introduction of maximum annual immigration ceilings and stricter conditions for the issuance of a residence permit, such as having ""sufficient resources"" (the amount of which would be raised by 25%), ""mastery of the French language"" and ""respect for secularism and the values of the Republic"". Finally, she wants to exclude people who have been living in France for less than five years from social assistance.


=== Homeland security ===
In response to the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks, Pécresse said France needed its own version of the Patriot Act.Following the murder of Samuel Paty in 2020, Pécresse argued for lifting restrictions on facial recognition and using artificial intelligence to fight terrorism on public transport networks.


=== Economic policy ===
Declaring herself in favour of economic liberalism, she said in August 2021 that she was ""two-thirds Merkel, one-third Thatcher"". In the run-up to the 2022 presidential election, she promised to cut public spending and taxes through four major reforms: eliminating 150,000 civil service jobs, moving to retirement at age 65, reducing unemployment benefits and withdrawing the state from competitive companies in which it is a minority shareholder. She also wants to end the 35-hour workweek. At the same time, she has attempted to present herself as an environmentalist.


== Personal life ==
Pécresse has been married to former investment banker and current CEO of GE Renewable Energy Jérôme Pécresse since 1994. The couple have three children.
