2,"Jalila Essaïdi (born 1980) is a Dutch artist, inventor and entrepreneur based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Essaïdi is specialised in the fields of modern biotechnology and biological arts (bio-art), and an entrepreneur in the field of sustainability with a background in business management and expertise in cross-sectoral collaborations. She is also founder and director of the non-profit BioArt Laboratories, and the for-profit Inspidere BV.


== Early life ==
Essaïdi obtained her bachelor's degree at the Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten in Tilburg in 2009. She studied bio-art at Leiden University from 2008 to 2010, after which she also did her master's degree in Art Education at the Fontys Zuyd Alliance from 2010 to 2011. After her master's degree, she followed Business Development at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2017 and Social Entrepreneurship at the Saïd Business School / University of Oxford and Skoll Center for Social Entrepreneurship in 2018.


== Major works ==


=== Bulletproof skin ===
Essaidi is best known for her work '2.6g 329 m/s', also known as 'Bulletproof Skin' (2011), a project to achieve bioengineered bulletproof human skin. This project combined in vitro human skin with spider silk from genetically modified organisms such as goats and silkworms to create a material that stops a slow-speed bullet, yet is pierced by one fired at normal speed. The impact of this international collaborative project was coined as a prime example of international cooperation by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.'Bulletproof Skin' is an artwork about the relativity- and dual nature of safety. Increased exposure to violence through news and other sources of (social)media manipulate our feeling of safety and gives rise to a culture of fear. The individual and even society can be driven by this feeling to make irrational responses to imaginary threats. With 'Bulletproof Skin', Essaïdi explores the social, political, ethical and cultural issues surrounding safety in a fearful world with access to new biotechnologies, by creating an exceptional controversial work: hybrid human art with a potential military application.


=== A simple line ===
With ‘A simple line’ (2014), Essaïdi attempts to merge the abstract idea of a line with its most tangible reality by having a zebra finch look at its own in vitro brain cells in the form of a line. A line made of specific cells (simple cells) which give rise to the abstract concept of lines and our perception of them.'A simple line' is a work about perception and the thin line between reality and abstraction. The project focuses on our neurological functioning and evokes the history of Piet Mondrian. In De Stijl, Mondrian was exploring a reduction of figures that decomposed nature and reduced it to its primal forms and colours. ‘A simple line’ pushes the perceptual purity even further by (...) merging the abstract idea of a line with the most tangible reality.


=== Mestic ===
Another well-known project is 'Mestic' (2015), a novel and economically viable method for producing regenerated cellulose fibres derived from a waste stream: cow manure. A breakthrough innovation that is fundamentally ahead with regards to sustainable practices of cellulose sources for fashion. Two of the most polluting industries in the world are being radically transformed with this one single idea: Turning an acute agricultural problem of waste into a new sustainable source of raw materials for the textile industry. Avoiding major environmental catastrophes, giving rise to a local circular economy with cow manure, therefore allowing the agricultural sector to adhere to (inter)national policies while still making it possible for them to keep their investment (cows) and grow.'Mestic' is a work about overriding our natural aversion to waste. In nature, nothing is considered waste. Yet manure, in its essence, is easily considered the vilest substance we know. ‘Mestic’ shows that even this most disgusting matter is inherently beautiful


== Career ==
Essaïdi excels in particular in the field of inspiration. She reaches a diverse audience through her many media interviews and publications, her worldwide audience for lectures, and her presence in the world's largest Museums. Recent exhibitions include: Victory and Albert Museum, London; State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow; World Expo 2017, Nur-Sultan; Power station of Art, Shanghai.Essaïdi's projects have been covered by Associated Press, Reuters, CNN and the BBC, among numerous others. It is when she founded her startup Inspidere BV (2015), to capitalise on this research, that she got invited to Startup Fest Europe to pitch among world-class speakers such as Eric Schmidt (CEO Alphabet/Google), Tim Cook (CEO Apple) and Travis Kalanick (CEO Uber). More recent significant keynote lectures include the Biodiversity Next Conference 2019, and the Creativity World Forum 2019.Essaïdi resides in the Eindhoven region. She was voted first place for ‘Regional Top Woman' in 2017. Essaïdi's impact was also recognised in Europe, in 2019 Essaïdi was finalist for the EU Prize for Women Innovators, by the European Commission


=== Inspidere ===
Inspidere is a for-profit biotech company, based in Eindhoven. With Inspidere Essaïdi set out to develop her patented multiple award-winning innovations such as methods for creating high performance fabrics and composite materials reinforced with spider silk obtained from genetically modified goats, and her method for producing manure-derived paper; bioplastics; and regenerated cellulose fibres.
The successful development of Mestic was recognised in 2017 by the textile industry and Jalila Essaïdi was awarded with the Global Change Award. This is a prestigious award offered by the H&M Foundation, that came with 150.000-euro prize money and the support of H&M Foundation, H&M, Accenture and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
Through this award, Essaïdi participated in an incubator by KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Through both the H&M foundation and Accenture Essaïdi developed direct contact with all major retail players in this industry and visited manufacturing plants in Shanghai. The opportunity (through H&M) to talk with anyone in the apparel industry and ask them any questions was vital since this industry is a really closed industry with limited access. Finally, the expertise of Accenture dealing with global projects, extended across multiple industries was key to the successful implementation of a truly sustainable version of Mestic.
Mestic has shown unprecedented emission reductions, reducing significant GWP in both the agricultural sector and the textile industry. A single t-shirt produced through this method reduces emissions by 1 kg of CO2 equivalents. Based on these results, and the power to change current practices, Essaïdi won in 2018 the Clim@ competition, an award organised by the Green for Growth Fund, initiated by the European Investment Bank. Through this award Essaïdi gained full support for obtaining future financing.
In addition to the environmental impact, Mestic focusses beyond revenue and profit, which won Essaïdi in 2018 the Chivas Venture. This is a prestigious award for social entrepreneurship offered by Chivas Regal, that came with 200.000-dollar prize money and the support of Saïd Business School and the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship.


=== BioArt Laboratories Foundation ===
Essaïdi does not just inspire other women to become innovators/leaders in innovation, but through her non-profit foundation BioArt Laboratories she actively scouts worldwide for young top- talents in (bio)tech, art and design. The foundation provides them with professional guidance in development and intellectual property; a 2000m2 laboratory; and a rapid prototyping facility to make their ideas more tangible.The core idea behind the foundation is: innovation for innovation is meaningless. The creative industry offers unique tools to make innovation socially relevant.
Starting 2020 the BioArt Laboratories Foundation is the National Development Institute for the Biological Arts, part of the basic cultural infrastructure directly funded by the Dutch Government. The foundation collaborates among others with NWO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, The Hague) and ZonMW (Medical Research Council, The Hague) and combines top-talents with top Dutch research groups in the life sciences through the Bio Art & Design Awards to collaborate on art and innovation.Through the foundation, Essaïdi has a direct impact on the innovation ecosystem and provides startup-accelerators, research groups and individuals with ideas and talents that can stand on their own.

6,"Johanna Catharina ""Tineke"" Huizinga-Heringa (born 16 February 1960) is a Dutch politician of the Christian Union (CU).
Huizinga grew up in Amersfoort; both of her parents were teachers. After attending gymnasium, she began to study law at the University of Utrecht. She became involved in the Christian student's association Ichtus, where she met her future husband. They married in 1982. After passing her candidate exams (roughly equivalent of a bachelor's degree), she stopped her studies and moved to Heerenveen. She became a housewife and mother of three children.
She volunteered as translator at a Christian foundation, Open Doors, which advocates the interest of persecuted Christians worldwide. She became involved in the cases of asylum seekers and refugees and worked as a volunteer for VluchtenlingenWerk Nederland. Because of her involvement with social and religious issues, the Reformatory Political Federation asked her to become their top candidate in Heerenveen for the 1998 municipal elections. She was elected into the Heerenveen municipal council.
In 2002 she was elected member of House of Representatives. She was elected on basis of preference votes. The ChristianUnion only got four seats and she was seventh candidate, but because so many voters voted for her she entered parliament at the cost of prominent GPV leader Eimert van Middelkoop. She was member of the parliamentary research committee into the Srebrenica massacre. In the 2003 elections she was re-elected, again with preference votes, now at the cost of Leen van Dijke. She was fourth candidate and the ChristianUnion only got three seats. In parliament she had been occupied with foreign affairs, international development, migration, integration, spatial planning and the environment. She was secretary of the parliamentary party.
On 22 February 2007, she became State Secretary for Transport and Public Works in the fourth Balkenende cabinet. The later MP Pieter Grinwis became Huizinga's political assistant. Her portfolio included all subjects related to water: primary water defenses, dikes, coastal protection, Room for the River, waterways, inland navigation, maritime shipping, regional seaports and KNMI. In addition, Huizinga was responsible for market forces in public transport, social safety and cab policy.
As Secretary of State for Transport, Public Works and Water Management, Huizinga survived a motion of no confidence in April 2008 over the (supposedly failed) introduction of a MIFARE-based nationwide public transport payment system.

== Career before politics ==
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958, she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company ""ZwaTra"", the company of her father.


== Local and national politics ==
Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971, she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981, she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.
Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.


== After National Politics ==
After her ministerial career, Kroes spent two years working on two projects as an advisor to Karel van Miert, at that time European Commissioner for Transport. She also became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991, Kroes became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001, Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).


== European Commission ==


=== Commissioner for Competition ===
In 2004, Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. At the time, her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group every year between 2005 and 2012.In 2009, she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.


=== Commissioner for Digital Agenda ===
In 2010, she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010.
The Digital Agenda for Europe is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
Since 2010, she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.In 2010, it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011, Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011, due to plagiarism charges – as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.In November 2012, Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.


== Later career ==
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies. For the 2019 European elections, she was brought into the European election campaign by Guy Verhofstadt's Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) in Belgium.In addition, Kroes has been holding a variety of paid and unpaid positions.


== Controversy ==
At the end of the 1980s, intensive research into environmental crime among chemical waste processing companies ended in a fiasco. As Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, Kroes had conceived the plan to provide subsidies to the companies TCA and TCR (Tanker Cleaning Amsterdam and Rotterdam, respectively). Even though she was made aware of the company's criminal activities, including mixing chemical waste into fuel oil, she pushed through with the subsidies. The resulting TCR affair sparked a parliamentary inquiry in 1997. Kroes was accused by the investigative committee that she had helped a rogue company with a government subsidy into the saddle, which made the environmental crimes possible.
In the mid-1990s, Kroes was involved in the frigate affair: the failed purchase of six Dutch frigates (amounting to 1.2 billion euros) by the United Arab Emirates. As chairman of a consortium of Holland Signaal, Ballast Nedam and Koninklijke Schelde (supported by the navy, the Port of Rotterdam Authority and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs), Kroes attempted to exchange the frigates for oil supplies. When it turned out that she was also using her chairmanship to serve the business interests of a personal friend, the businessman Joop van Caldenborgh, she was removed from her position by the government. It was only in 2011 that it became known that she had also put Prince Bernhard forward as a lobbyist in this deal, in violation of the agreements that Bernhard had made with the Den Uyl cabinet after the Lockheed affair. The frigate affair brought Kroes into contact with Jordanian investor Amin Badr-El-Din, with whom she would run the company Mint Holdings some years later, which was planning to take over part of Enron.In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas. As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company. Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014). According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an ""oversight"", and declared that she would take full responsibility.The “Uber files”, leaked documents in 2022, revealing active and irregular efforts of Uber in lobbying regulators, revealed that Kroes prepared her appointment at the taxi company when she was still in office. 
She did not disclose the numerous appointments she had with firms executives when European Commissioner for competition and then new technologies (a position she held until November 2014).  
After resigning from the European Commission, she actively helped Uber bending regulations by opening her contacts to the company, including Netherlands then Prime Minister Mark Rutte, breaking her 18-months duty of réserve that ex commissionner must apply. She finally joins Uber Public Affairs team in 2016.


== Personal life ==
Kroes was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper. She is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.


=== Corporate boards ===

10,"Mariska Majoor (Hilversum, 2 November 1968) is a Dutch writer, publicist, speaker, entrepreneur, and former sex worker. She founded the Prostitution Information Center (1994) and the labour union PROUD (2015) in Amsterdam to support (novice) sex workers and inform passers-by/tourists and the general public, answer questions and dispel misconceptions about everything involving sex work. Majoor gives lectures and presentations on sex work, and has written several books including Als sex werken wordt (1999; English When Sex Becomes Work, 2016), United Under a Red Umbrella: Sex Work Around the World (2018), and Amsterdam Red Light District: The future of our past (2023). In 2017, Mariska Majoor was knighted by the Mayor of Amsterdam in recognition of her contribution to sex workers' rights in the Netherlands.


== Biography ==


=== Sex worker ===
Mariska Majoor was born 2 November 1968 in Hilversum, and grew up in Laren, North Holland. By her own account, she had a protective Catholic upbringing in which she was absolutely not allowed to do certain things.: 23:30  As a 16-year-old, Majoor ran away from home and dropped out of school. She voluntarily chose a job as a sex worker a short while later. In hindsight, she had started ""impulsively"", for ""a very idiotic reason"" because she needed quick money for something, though she never regretted it.: 13:04  She said In 1994, she recounted that she had 'had an awful lot of fun, and also experienced some very unpleasant things', especially regarding social stigma and poor working conditions because it was still an illegal profession.: 23:17  Yet, she did think her best time was when she was behind the window and later worked in a private house because it was 'very exciting': 'You're having fun with your colleagues, which is very personal. You've got a certain sense of power when you're almost in your bare arse behind a window and the whole world can see you. (...) It's hard to explain.': 23:38  When she decided to quit, she couldn't really find other work she liked: 'I did all sorts of shitty jobs: cleaning, making coffee. But working for a boss, with my big smart mouth, was not for me.'After five years, she combined her plans for her own business with her knowledge and experience about sex work. From 1992, she published the bilingual English-Dutch magazine Pleasure Guide: informatief magazine over het betaalde liefdesleven (""informative magazine on the paid love life""), about which she was interviewed by NRC Handelsblad in August of that year. The first print run was 20,000 copies, and the issues distributed in Amsterdam sold out within two weeks. Majoor wanted to bring prostitution 'out of that eternal corner of damnation', inform clients and tourists about prevailing morals and legislation, and give clients practical advice on what can and cannot be done: 'I know how client and prostitute interact with each other, and it could be much better. Something had to be done about that.' She also noted that due to women's emancipation, more and more prostitutes were becoming self-employed rather than (still) seeking employment contracts with brothel operators: 'Women began making their own choices, and so did prostitutes. They became independent entrepreneurs.' Initially, the Pleasure Guide still depended on advertising revenue, which is why Majoor initially did not write about clubs that she found worthy of certain criticisms; critical articles were to be published once the magazine was taken seriously.


=== Prostitution Information Center ===

In August 1994, Majoor founded the Prostitution Information Center in the De Wallen, Amsterdam's red-light district. In late January 1995, Majoor launched the first training course in the Netherlands for both women and men who wanted to become prostitutes, or were working in the sex trade already and wanted to learn more.: 7:16  Majoor told Trouw about the course: 'I'm launching this because so often in the trade you hear people say that prostitution is a real profession (...); well, then there should be an educational programme for it as well. Because there are plenty of things to learn about.' For 250 guilders, participants received explanations from Majoor, other (former) sex workers, sexologists and other experts on the history of prostitution, what types of sex work there are, health, money matters and personal well-being in six half-days spread over six weeks.: 10:40  With each trainee, Majoor first conducted an intake interview to ask why she or he wanted to do sex work and whether it was a good reason or not; besides earning money, the person must also like the job.: 8:08  She found it important to make a conscious choice for the profession and not end up there from a problematic situation, such as debts or drug addiction.: 9:25  On 9 July 1995, Majoor took the initiative to allow 16 male sex workers to work behind windows in the red-light district as an experiment. There were both positive and negative responses to the initiative; however, because it attracted so many camera crews and created a fuss among female sex workers in nearby premises, the experiment had to be suspended prematurely.Over the years, the PIC has simultaneously functioned as an information desk, red-light district shop (including sex toys, books and pamphlets by Majoor on sex work-related frequently asked questions), library, mini-museum and art gallery. Majoor spoke to the press there, answered questions from passers-by, and gave tours of the red-light district. Because a sex worker from The Hague had come to her asking for more information in book form, which, however, was not available, she herself wrote the handbook Als sex werken wordt (When Sex Becomes Work) in 1999, with handy tips and checklists such as 'When is your boyfriend starting to look like a pimp' and '10 reasons to do/don't do it'.
Majoor supported the abolition of the Dutch brothel ban in 2000 and considered it ""a logical step"" towards the decriminalisation of sex work. But she was sceptical about how it was being implemented: 'The government and brothel owners proclaim so easily that regulation is for the benefit of prostitutes, but if you look in practice, they have other priorities.' She pointed out that sex workers had been paying taxes since the 1950s, but that this was only now being formalised, there was a sudden crackdown on any form of prostitution that had not yet been legalised (with the aim of combating human trafficking, which everyone agreed with in principle, but not the means by which it was being implemented) and the new policy seemed to be enforced rather arbitrarily. Regardless, Majoor wrote a new tax leaflet for sex workers who wanted to follow the new legislation but did not know how.After the brothel ban was lifted in 2000, the government stopped subsidising several organisations working for the interests of sex workers, including the Mr. A. de Graafstichting (1960–2005) and foundation The Red Thread (De Rode Draad), who ran into financial difficulties as a result. In December 2005, Majoor appeared on television channel Netherlands 3 in the talk show Woestijnruiters (precursor to Pauw & Witteman), where she got into a discussion with Karina Schaapman, another former sex worker who – unlike Majoor – had since turned against the trade.An open day has been held in De Wallen red-light district several times since 2006. At the open day of 31 March 2007, for the second time at the initiative of Mariska Majoor, male prostitutes were behind the windows to have sex with either women or men in exchange for payment. The same day, on her initiative, a bronze statue called Belle by artist Els Rijerse was also unveiled on the Oudekerksplein as an tribute to sex workers. However, in 2007, the Amsterdam mayor's office) launched a campaign called Platform 1012, which aimed to buy out some window brothels and replace them with fashion and art shops. Following criticism of promotion of De Wallen red-light district on the government's tourism website, those web pages were removed, and in 2008 the mayor's office promised to remove all window prostitution and Majoor's Prostitution Information Center around the Oude Kerk. However, because the mayor's office systematically referred to the entire neighbourhood and all businesses located there as ""criminal"" or ""criminogenic"", the approach backfired and the affected window operators, coffee shop owners and other neighbourhood entrepreneurs jointly turned against it.In 2012, the well-known Dutch sex workers foundation The Red Thread (De Rode Draad) went bankrupt. In response, Majoor founded the new sex workers' association PROUD as its successor in 2015. Sekswerk Nederland (SWN, ""Sex Work Netherlands"", active 2014–2015), a research organisation by and for sex workers founded by Yvette Luhrs, began cooperating with PROUD, and later merged into it (Luhrs later succeeded Majoor as its president). As president of PROUD, Majoor spearheaded a major demonstration of hundreds of sex workers on 9 April 2015, protesting against the plans of the Amsterdam mayor's office to close dozens of windows in De Wallen red-light district, without consulting the sex workers involved. She told the Associated Press: 'They [=the mayor's office of Amsterdam] say that they want to have more control over the sex industry because it is related often to human trafficking and abuse, but in our opinion they use that as an excuse only for the gentrification project.': 0:55 


=== Further work and activism ===
In 2016, Majoor was diagnosed with lymphoma, forcing her to make the difficult decision to leave the red-light district after more than 30 years. In April 2017, she was honoured by the mayor of Amsterdam as a knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau for her many years of providing information on prostitution and advocacy for sex workers. In the meantime, however, she had already set up a new company called Koekje uit Amsterdam (""Biscuit from Amsterdam""), personally delivering boxes of biscuits by bike to catering businesses across Amsterdam. It was not very successful initially, partly because Majoor was not doing well physically, and she had to undergo many medical examinations.In autumn 2017, Majoor and her daughter Robin made 13 trips to countries around the world to meet sex workers and collect their stories, which they compiled in United Under A Red Umbrella: Sex work around the world (2018), for which Robin did the photography.  In the book, they describe major differences between how sex work is viewed around the world (with varying degrees of stigma), in what situations the work takes place and how safe it is, but the interviewees (including male sex workers, who, according to Majoor, have to fight ""doubly"" for acceptance) were keen to ""talk to someone who comes from the profession themselves. This struggle creates solidarity.' Majoor was then also diagnosed with stomach cancer in late 2018, forcing her to undergo tougher treatments, and Robin cycled around the city delivering the orders whenever her mother was too ill.
When the horeca shut down in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Koekje uit Amsterdam was stuck without customers, Majoor donated many boxes to shelters for the homeless, which she had already been in solidarity with for years. After the pandemic, her biscuit business flourished and became a supplier to several prominent Amsterdam hotel and catering companies. In October 2023, Majoor initiated a protest march against the Amsterdam municipality's plans to relocate window brothels to an erotic centre; she handed the mayor the Manifesto for the Preservation of the Amsterdam Wallen.

Its 1977 manifesto included as the organisation's aims: ""to curb and/or prevent material damage and immaterial damage inflicted to individuals or groups in our society by the Dutch legal system"". The BWO campaigned for reforms such as detainee minimum wages, the abolition of censorship of letters for detainees, and the right to unsupervised visits. The group visited inmates at a local prison and undertook legal interventions on their behalf.
Verdonk participated in a non-violent human blockade during the Pierson riots of 1981, when plans for housing demolition to make room for a parking lot triggered violent civil unrest. Because of her activism during this period, she earned the nickname ""Red Rita."" 
After graduating in 1983, Verdonk became a trainee at the Department of Correction at the Ministry of Justice. In 1984, she was promoted to Assistant-Director at the Scheveningen Detention Centre. In 1988, she became a member of the board of the Prison 'De Schie' in Rotterdam. In 1992, she switched to the Ministry of Justice's department of Youth and Hospital Orders Institutions, where she reached the position of vice-director. In 1996, she was appointed as Director of the Department of State Security of the Ministry of Interior Affairs.
Between 1999 and 2003 she was Senior Manager / Director of the consulting firm KPMG (as of 2002, Atos KPMG Consulting). In 2002 she became a member of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to become more active in politics. In a 2006 article, some of Verdonk's friends and colleagues from her Nijmegen days expressed surprise at Verdonk's radical switch in political orientation after graduating in 1983. Some observed that Verdonk had never held outspoken left-wing ideals and criticized communist regimes; others hypothesized that it was part of a growing-up phase; a former treasurer of the BWO suspected that Verdonk had been a police informer all those years.


== Minister for Integration ==
In 2003, Verdonk was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration. She soon developed a reputation for toughness and outspokenness, with her uncompromising immigration policies earning her the nickname IJzeren Rita (Iron Rita). As a minister, Verdonk enjoyed a rare level of recognition and popularity amongst voters, but was also reviled by many as a populist with an impulsive style of governing. In June 2004 Verdonk was smeared with ketchup by two females protestors in opposition to her stance on immigration as part of a ""playful protest"", for which they got 11 days of prisontime. After the political murders of politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002 and film director Theo van Gogh in 2004, the Dutch Ministry of Interior Affairs began to monitor Verdonk's security tightly for her own protection. From 4 June 2008, the Dutch Cabinet discontinued the monitoring on the grounds that the threat level had abated.


=== Asylum case of Ayaan Hirsi Ali ===
Earlier in 2006, a TV programme had reported that MP Hirsi Ali had provided false information on her asylum application in 1992 concerning her name, date of birth, and country where she had been residing prior to seeking asylum. Ayaan had much earlier admitted this to her friends and party colleagues (including Verdonk) already, however this was the first time that the story was reported publicly in the media. Additionally the TV programme interviewed members of Hirsi Ali's family and they had denied her earlier claims that she had sought asylum to prevent an arranged marriage that she objected to, stating instead that she had agreed to it. A government investigation raised many questions about the veracity of these claims.
Based on a ruling by the Hoge Raad (Supreme Court), Verdonk said that Hirsi Ali did not have legitimate Dutch citizenship. According to the Hoge Raad, except under very special circumstances, Dutch citizenship could not be granted if the subject had lied about his or her name and date of birth. In a broadcast on the Dutch public network, Hirsi Ali had admitted that she had lied about her name and date of birth in her application, and that she had been living with her family for 12 years in Kenya before arriving in the Netherlands, and had not arrived directly from Somalia, which at that time was experiencing civil war. The decision by Verdonk caused considerable controversy. VVD-deputy prime minister Zalm said he was surprised that events known for years suddenly resulted in action by Verdonk two days after a television program about Hirsi Ali's past. He said Verdonk has disqualified herself from being the prime candidate for the VVD in the coming elections. On 16 May 2006, Ayaan Hirsi Ali who was herself an MP for the VVD, as well as  Gerrit Zalm, criticized Verdonk for her decision to revoke Hirsi Ali's passport.
In a session in parliament on the issue of Hirsi Ali's citizenship, Verdonk said that she had no choice but to revoke her passport, as it had been issued under a false name and false date of birth. Some members of parliament suggested that Verdonk's stern actions were a result of her political ambitions in the 2006 VVD leadership elections. The result of the debate was that Verdonk promised to have another look at the case and see if it was possible for Hirsi Ali to keep her citizenship.
On 27 June 2006 Verdonk informed parliament of her decision to allow MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali to keep her Dutch passport after all. According to Verdonk, Hirsi Ali had presented her with new convincing evidence related to her use of her grandfather's surname, and the false date of birth was insufficient grounds to cancel her passport. The next day, during a parliamentary debate took place, minister Verdonk and prime-minister Jan Peter Balkenende were questioned about the decision. At the end of the first period of the debate, the prime minister said that Hirsi Ali had to sign a letter accepting responsibility for her false statements in order to retain her citizenship. Otherwise, the solution would not be acceptable for minister Verdonk.
In the second period of the debate, a vote of no confidence was proposed by the Green Party GroenLinks. It was supported by the Balkenende cabinet coalition partner, Democrats 66 (D66). The vote did not meet the required majority as it was opposed by the right-wing populist LPF. Because a coalition partner supported the motion—a unique situation in Dutch politics—the Balkenende cabinet had to decide if this had consequences for Rita Verdonk as minister, and the second Balkenende cabinet.
Van Beek, an MP for the VVD, said after the debate that it would be almost unthinkable that if Verdonk resigned, the cabinet would stay intact, as one of the coalition partners of the cabinet had lost its confidence in the minister. D66, feeling dissatisfied that minister Verdonk did not resign following the debate, withdrew its support for the cabinet. This resulted in the fall of the cabinet's on 29 June.


=== Outgoing Minister ===
On 30 November 2006 the new parliament was sworn in as the result of elections a week earlier. On 1 November Labour Party leader Wouter Bos proposed a motion for what in effect would constitute an amnesty for an estimated 26,000 asylum seekers who had asked for asylum more than five years ago and had their asylum applications turned down. This motion requested of the cabinet, ""in anticipation of a definite discussion on the amnesty by the new House of Representatives, not to take any irreversible measures with respect to this group"".During her tenure as Minister for Immigration, Verdonk had specifically cited the rejection of those 26,000 persons as an example of her toughening of the immigration laws (see Policy below). The motion was passed with a 75–74 majority, the VVD, Prime Minister Balkenende's CDA, and the right-wing PVV and SGP parties dissenting. Both Verdonk, although now considered a 'caretaker', and Prime Minister Balkenende criticized the motion. There was speculation that Verdonk resigned for this reason. On 3 December after several meetings, the cabinet decided not to honor the motion, because an amnesty would be impossible to implement. It agreed to postpone expulsion of asylum seekers until after a special parliamentary session to be held on 12 December.During this session on 12 December, a motion was proposed by the PvdA asking Verdonk to refrain from acting on expulsions until the new cabinet was formed. This motion was supported by all the left-wing  and centre-left parties and it passed with a slim 76–72 majority. Verdonk claimed this motion amounted to a de facto amnesty and affirmed her well-known stance: any amnesty was unenforceable. She declared expulsions would continue after the debate, before cabinet could issue an official statement the next day. Verdonk also refused to postpone those expulsions for another 24 hours until a new debate could take place the next day. In reaction, the whole parliament asked for an official statement from the cabinet that same evening.Following an additional debate, during which Prime Minister Balkenende said that Verdonk had the full support of the cabinet, a motion of no confidence was accepted by the same coalition of left-wing parties. Before the vote took place, Mark Rutte declared that should Verdonk resign, all VVD ministers would join her. The cabinet was in a 10-hour meeting on 13 December before deciding that all ministers would stay on and that Hirsch Ballin would take over Verdonk's responsibility for immigration. In exchange, Verdonk added Hirsch Ballin's justice department responsibilities over youth care, prevention and probation to her portfolio. Hirsch Ballin could execute the 12 December motion started by the PvdA, and postpone the expulsions of asylum seekers based on humanitarian grounds, such as the responsibility for under-age children, until a new cabinet was formed.On 22 February 2007 Verdonk stood down as minister when the fourth cabinet Balkenende was installed. Her portfolios were taken over by Ella Vogelaar (integration) and Nebahat Albayrak (immigration).


=== Policy ===
Verdonk's most discussed propositions and decisions are:

In order to reduce immigration through marriage, she proposed that partners of Dutch citizens who come from countries outside the EU only be allowed to immigrate into the Netherlands if the Dutch partner earns more than 120% of the minimum income.
She refused to grant an amnesty to around 26,000 asylum seekers who had their asylum applications turned down but who had been living in the Netherlands for more than 5 years by that time. Since they had entered the Netherlands before the new Foreigner Law, it appeared that a special arrangement was required. Instead of an amnesty, Verdonk chose to deal with these thousands of cases individually.
To integrate immigrants into the Dutch society, each person who wants to immigrate into the Netherlands must pass an integration test, except for those who come from other European Union-member states, United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand (such immigrants must still take a year of integration classes after entry). It tests knowledge of the Dutch language, political system and social conventions. The test must be taken before entering the Netherlands, preferably in a Dutch embassy in the person's country of origin. Immigrants coming from an EU state, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand cannot take this integration test, even if they want to.
""Oudkomers"", immigrants who have lived in the Netherlands for a long time, but are not ""integrated"", were requested to take the exam. Verdonk tried to make such tests mandatory also for Dutch nationals who were born and raised outside the Netherlands . The constitutionality of these tests, especially in being applied to oudkomers and Dutch nationals, has been questioned both by the Council of State, which advises government on all proposed laws, and various parties in the parliament, including Verdonk's VVD. These proposals were to be implemented in January 2007.Minister Verdonk was called to parliament for the following issues:

In October 2005 it was discovered that civil servants of the Immigration & Naturalisation Services had informed the Congolese embassy and authorities that several of the people sent back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. The Congo had long been struggling with civil war. This information is considered confidential and should not have been disclosed to the Congolese authorities. Verdonk at first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted that she had lied. In several cases, the Congolese embassy had been informed that several returnees had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. According to members of the opposition, this information could put returnees (in this case to Congo) at risk of torture or other oppression, but no party or organization provided documentation for the claim. Verdonk maintains that no other sensitive information was given to the Congolese authorities, in accordance with the findings of a special committee (Commissie Havermans).
In December 2005, a cell-complex for denied refugees at Amsterdam Airport burned down after a fire had been started by one of the refugees. Eleven refugees died. Surviving refugees reported that they had to wait more than 45 minutes before being released from their cells. A man suspected of connections with terrorist organizations had escaped in the disruption. Before the fire's investigation was completed, Verdonk stated that prison workers adequately handled the circumstances. Subsequently, in September 2006, she granted temporary stay permits to many of the survivors of the Schiphol airport detention center fire, overriding the regular court hearing procedures.As a minister, Verdonk has proposed the following, which have not become law:

In October 2005, a ban on Muslim women wearing the burqa in public places, on the grounds that the burqa, which covers the face, is a security risk since suicide bombers could use it as a disguise. She  cancelled a meeting with Dutch Muslim leaders when one (of the 30) would not shake hands with her, because she is a woman. She has said that ""the time for cosy tea-drinking"" with Muslim groups had passed.
In January 2006, she proposed the adoption of a national code of conduct, listing the most important conventions of Dutch society, to facilitate the integration of immigrants. She was inspired by a similar initiative undertaken by the city of Rotterdam. One requirement would be that everyone agreed to speak only Dutch in the streets.
Upon receiving Dutch citizenship, immigrants would have to sing the first stanza of the national anthem, the ""Wilhelmus.""
In March 2006, Verdonk considered returning homosexual asylum seekers to Iran because she understood they were no longer being prosecuted. The general public conception was that acts of homosexuality were still punishable by death. She noted that homosexuality in itself was not punishable by death sentence in Iran. In response to parliamentary criticism, the Minister announced on 4 March that all asylum cases involving homosexual Iranians would be assessed on an individual basis. Her proposed policy initially earned her selection for the Human Rights Watch Hall of Shame.Verdonk strictly applied the Alien Integration Act of 1998 (Wet Inburgering Nieuwkomers), which was introduced by Job Cohen, the social democratic State Secretary for Justice in the Cabinet Kok II.


=== Criticism ===
Verdonk's expulsion policies were criticised in the TV series, 26,000 gezichten (26,000 faces), in which the personal lives of many of these people were shown, in hopes that public opinion would change when viewers saw that these 26,000 were mostly ordinary, friendly people.
In January 2006, Verdonk received the negative Dutch Big Brother Award for ""promoting privacy violations"".
In Amnesty International's magazine Wordt Vervolgd, Ruud Lubbers, a former three-time prime minister and UN High Commissioner For Refugees, said that ""Verdonk should not finish her job"" and ""The Netherlands is in a spasm (...) It would help if we could 'de-Verdonk' the situation"".
In December 2006, Verdonk was elected 'worst politician' by her colleague members of parliament, in a poll by the current affairs television program EenVandaag; qualified her as an 'elephant in a china cabinet' (a Dutch expression similar to the English idiom 'a bull in a china shop'), ruthless and incompetent. In a similar poll, EenVandaag viewers ranked Verdonk in second place on both the 'best politician' and 'worst politician' lists.


== 2006 bid for VVD leadership ==
On 4 April 2006, Verdonk announced her ambition to become political leader and to succeed Jozias van Aartsen as the lijsttrekker of the VVD for the coming elections, at the time expected to be held 2006. Her direct competitors in the leadership election were staatssecretaris of Education Mark Rutte and MP Jelleke Veenendaal. Although her political views on subjects other than immigration and integration had mostly been unclear, she was a likely candidate. Shortly after announcing she would be candidate, a poll for the RTL 4 News estimated that 56% of the people preferred Verdonk as the leader of the VVD. Verdonk was advised by Kay van de Linde, who had been part of anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn's 2002 election campaign, which was cut short by his assassination on 6 May of that year. Verdonk's opponents said that several of her statements and policies seemed to exploit xenophobic emotions in the country. On an official visit to Morocco, when visiting a poor neighbourhood, she remarked, ""I do not understand why these Moroccans come to the Netherlands. There is so much work to do here"".On 31 May 2006, Verdonk lost to Mark Rutte in the 2006 VVD leadership election, gaining 46% of the vote, less than the majority required.De Telegraaf reported on 23 June 2006 that Verdonk discussed policies with Marco Pastors of Leefbaar Rotterdam. The news report fueled fears that Verdonk might leave the VVD in order to form a new right-wing political party allied with Leefbaar Rotterdam and Lijst Pim Fortuyn. Verdonk denied the rumourIn the 2006 election, Verdonk received a greater number of preference votes (620,555) than the VVD lijsttrekker Mark Rutte (553,200). As a result, on 28 November she held a press conference in which she urged the party to rethink their policies via a special committee. She renewed her desire to become party leader but said she would for the present remain loyal to Rutte. A few hours later on 28 November after meeting with the party, she withdrew both ideas. Chances of Verdonk to become party leader decreased with this action, described as an ""attempted coup"" by media and party members.On 20 January 2007 NRC Handelsblad profiled Verdonk (caption: The Netherlands at my feet), observing that her election-campaign team was not resolved. It said that she was still determined to grab the VVD leadership, possibly right after the March provincial 2007 elections, in the event that her opponent Rutte again performed poorly.


=== Controversies ===
In the HP/De Tijd issue of 5 June 2007, Verdonk said the following about Mark Rutte: ""He is a decent VVD member, but he's not really right-wing. I really can't see how he would be."" Rutte objected to this statement, but the prominent VVD elder statesman Hans Wiegel defended Verdonk. Verdonk finally apologised for her statement. After the controversy, the popularity of the VVD in the opinion polls decreased. Rutte gave Verdonk a final warning and said that VVD members had to ""obey or get lost"".Around 21 June 2007, Radboud Magazine published an interview with Verdonk, in which she said that the VVD was ""hijacked"" by ""left-wing liberals"", and that she wanted to ""undo"" that. Although Rutte had warned her before, he didn't take any action, because the interview had been done in April before his warning.


== VVD member of Parliament ==
From November 2006 until September 2007, Verdonk served as member of parliament for the VVD in the opposition benches as the education specialist.


== Independent member of Parliament ==
On 13 September 2007, Verdonk criticised the direction of the VVD again. She said that the VVD was ""invisible"" in the debate about immigration. The party met to decide on the fate of Verdonk. Rutte said he wanted to expel her. Later that afternoon, news reports confirmed that Verdonk had been expelled. Rutte said that ""Verdonk had damaged the reputation of the VVD due to remarks in the media far too often"". Verdonk said she would continue in the House of Representatives and that she would not give up her seat. She also confirmed that she would not join the Partij voor de Vrijheid. Geert Wilders, leader of the PVV, was disappointed by this comment and said he still wanted to speak with Verdonk about a possible joint party. Prominent VVD members such as Hans Wiegel and Frans Weisglas spoke of a ""disastrous"" decision by Rutte.The next day, Verdonk said that she still needed some more time to think over her decision again, but Rutte declined this, and she was formally expelled from the parliamentary faction of the VVD on 14 September 2007. In October 2007, the VVD party board gave her the option of either giving up her parliamentary seat, or face exclusion procedures from the party. Verdonk announced that she would leave the party but stay in Parliament. After further consideration, she announced the creation of a new political movement, Proud of the Netherlands (Trots op NL), which she launched in April 2008.
According to opinion polls published on 6 December 2009, Verdonk's movement, Trots op NL, would win one seat in the Dutch parliament. In the 2010 elections Trots won no seat. She resigned from politics in 2011. The party has combined with another party on the right.
