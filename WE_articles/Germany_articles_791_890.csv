11,"Annalena Charlotte Alma Baerbock (German: [anaːˌleːnaː ˈbɛːɐ̯ˌbɔk] ; born 15 December 1980) is a German politician of the Alliance 90/The Greens party serving as Germany's minister for foreign affairs since 2021.
From 2018 to January 2022, Baerbock served as co-leader of Alliance 90/The Greens, alongside Robert Habeck. She was the party's candidate for chancellor in the 2021 federal election. However, after the backlash she received due to a series of scandals involving her acts of plagiarism and exaggeration of her professional background in her CV, Olaf Scholz from SPD secured the chancellery instead. After the election, the Greens formed a traffic light coalition led by Olaf Scholz, and Baerbock was sworn in as Germany's first female foreign minister on 8 December 2021.
Born in Hanover, West Germany, in 1980, Baerbock attended the University of Hamburg and the London School of Economics and Political Science. She was first elected to the Bundestag in 2013. From 2012 to 2015, she was a member of the party council of Alliance 90/The Greens and from 2009 to 2013, the leader of her party's group in the state of Brandenburg.


== Early life and education ==
Baerbock is the daughter of a social worker and a mechanical engineer who worked for WABCO Vehicle Control Systems. After initially living in Nuremberg for several years, she moved to live in an old reconstructed farmhouse that her family owned in Schulenburg, which is part of Pattensen, near Hanover in Lower Saxony. There, she grew up with her two sisters and two cousins. As a child, she joined her parents at anti-war and anti-nuclear power protests organized or supported by the Green Party. She attended the Humboldt School in Hanover and at the age of 16, spent an exchange year at Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando, Florida.As a teenager, Baerbock was a competitive trampoline gymnast, taking part in German championships and winning bronze three times.From 2000 to 2004, Baerbock studied political science and public law at the University of Hamburg. She also worked as a journalist for the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung from 2000 to 2003. She completed internships at Norddeutscher Rundfunk, Deutsche Presseagentur and the Council of Europe.In 2005, Baerbock completed a one-year master's course in public international law at the London School of Economics (LSE). During her time at LSE, she stayed at Carr-Saunders Hall in Fitzrovia. In 2005, she was a trainee at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL). She also started a dissertation on natural disasters and humanitarian aid at the Free University of Berlin, but did not finish it.


== Early career ==
After her studies, Baerbock worked from 2005 to 2008 in the office of MEP Elisabeth Schroedter. In 2008 and 2009, she worked as an adviser on foreign and security policies for the parliamentary group of the Alliance 90/The Greens in the Bundestag.


== Political career ==


=== Beginnings ===
Baerbock became a member of Alliance 90/The Greens in 2005. In October 2008, she was elected to the executive board of her party's state group in Brandenburg. The next year she succeeded Ska Keller as co-chair of the board (with Benjamin Raschke), an office she held until 2013.Baerbock served as the national spokesperson for the Green Party's working group on European affairs from 2008 to 2013. From 2009 to 2012, she was a member of the executive board of the European Green Party, under the leadership of co-chairs Philippe Lamberts and Monica Frassoni.


=== Member of the German Bundestag: 2013–present ===
In 2009, Baerbock unsuccessfully ran for a place on her party's electoral list for the federal elections. In 2013, she was the Green Party candidate in the constituency of Potsdam – Potsdam-Mittelmark II – Teltow-Fläming II and also secured the leading spot on the party's electoral list for the State of Brandenburg. Through the electoral list, she became a member of the Bundestag.During her first term, Baerbock was a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Energy and the Committee on European Affairs. In her parliamentary group, she served as speaker for climate policy. In the latter capacity, she participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in Warsaw (2013), Lima (2014), Paris (2015) and Marrakesh (2016).
In addition to her committee assignments, Baerbock served as deputy chair of the Berlin-Taipei Parliamentary Circle of Friends and a member of the German-Polish Parliamentary Friendship Group from 2014 until 2017.
In the 2017 election, Baerbock was again the leading candidate in the state of Brandenburg, retaining her seat in Parliament. After the election, she was a member of the Green Party party's negotiating team in the (unsuccessful) coalition talks with the CDU/CSU and FDP. She has since been a member of the Committee on Families, Seniors, Women and Youth.


=== Co-leader of the Green Party: 2018–2022 ===
On 27 January 2018, at the Green Party's national convention in her hometown of Hanover, Baerbock was elected as one of two equal chairpersons of her party at the federal level, with Robert Habeck. She won 64% of the vote, more than her challenger, Anja Piel. At a 2019 party convention, she was re-elected with 97.1% of the votes, the highest-ever result for a party chair.In the negotiations to form a coalition government under the leadership of Minister-President of Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke after the 2019 state elections, Baerbock was a member of her party's delegation.


=== Chancellor candidate: 2021 ===
On 19 April 2021, the federal board of the Greens officially nominated Baerbock as candidate for chancellor for the 2021 federal election – the first time the party had nominated a single candidate instead of co-leaders. This was formally confirmed at the party congress from 11 to 13 June. Baerbock is the second woman after Angela Merkel to seek the highest government office, and the first woman nominated by her party. On election day, she was only 12 days older than Guido Westerwelle in 2002, the youngest chancellor candidate ever.
On 12 June 2021, Baerbock was confirmed as candidate for chancellor after receiving 98.5% of the confirmation votes. In the 2021 German federal election, she again ran in the constituency of Potsdam – Potsdam-Mittelmark II – Teltow-Fläming II, this time against fellow chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz. She lost the constituency to Scholz by over 15,000 votes, but was nonetheless elected to the Bundestag through the Green list in Brandenburg.During this time, it was discovered that Baerbock committed plagiarism in a book she authored Jetzt. Wie wir unser Land erneuern, having copy-pasted 29 sentences altogether from other works. A detailed analysis of the plagiarism is available in a German document. Another wrongdoing unearthed was that she published false information about her professional background in her CV. She incorrectly claimed that she was a member of German Marshall Fund and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees along with many other minor institutions, which she had no formal ties to. These discoveries triggered widespread condemnation in the German public.According to studies conducted by the German Marshall Fund and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, both German and Russian state-backed sources have targeted Baerbock, spreading a large amount of disinformation, from false assumptions about the Greens to explicit sexism, such as the circulated online image featuring Baerbock's face photoshopped onto a naked female body with the caption ""I was young and I needed the money"".Under Baerbock's leadership, the Greens won 14.8% of the national vote in 2021 and 118 seats in the Bundestag, the best result in the party's history. However, the performance was considered somewhat disappointing as the party finished third after having led in some polls earlier in the year.


=== Foreign minister: 2021–present ===
Following the 2021 election, the Greens agreed to enter government with the FDP and the Social Democrats, as part of a traffic light coalition led by Olaf Scholz. Baerbock was named Foreign Minister and took office on 8 December 2021, the first woman ever to hold the role.Baerbock visited Warsaw in December 2021 to meet with the Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau. They discussed Poland's dispute with the EU over the rule of law and the superiority of European Union law. Baerbock backed Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus. She rejected the idea of paying World War II reparations to Poland. Germany still asserts that Poland waived all reparation rights under the 1953 agreement and that the dispute is settled. Poland rejects this view, stating that the Polish government was then under the sway of the Soviet Union and that its 1953 refusal is non-binding.
Baerbock harbors strong Atlanticist views and is assumed to follow a foreign policy in coherent with the one pursued by the US President Joe Biden.On 23 December 2021, Baerbock warned that Afghanistan is ""heading into the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our time"", with major economic sectors collapsing and more than 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. She said, ""We cannot allow hundreds of thousands of children to die because we don't want to take action."" She also promised to speed up the evacuation of more than 15,000 vulnerable Afghans, including staff who worked for Germany and their family members.When Germany held the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) in 2022, Baerbock chaired the meetings of G7 Ministers of Foreign Affairs.
In January 2022, Baerbock refused to supply German weapons to Ukraine amid rising tensions on the Ukraine-Russia border, while NATO allies including the United States opted to send arms in support of Ukraine. In the aftermath of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, she argued against blocking Russian access to SWIFT. Following the Bucha massacre in April 2022, she expelled 40 Russian diplomats and embassy staff from Berlin, joining other European Union countries in their response to alleged war crimes by Russian troops in Ukraine. Also in April 2022, she hosted a donor conference during which European and international governments agreed to extend 659.5 million euros ($718.6 million) in aid to Moldova, which hosted more than 100,000 refugees from Ukraine at the time.In July 2022, she rejected Turkey's territorial claims to Greek islands in the Aegean, saying that ""Lesbos, Chios, Rhodes and many others are Greek territories and nobody has the right to question them."" She warned that Turkey's threat to launch a new offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria will only help the Islamic State jihadists.In January 2023, Baerbock and French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna arrived in Ethiopia and met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on a mission to support the Ethiopia–Tigray peace agreement ending the Tigray War.In January 2023, Baerbock made her third visit to Ukraine by touring Kharkiv, following her travels to Bucha in May and Kyiv in September of the previous year.
In a keynote speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 24 January, she said in English ""We are fighting a war against Russia, not against each other"", which was critically portrayed in the popular tabloid newspaper Bild with the headline ""We are at war with Russia"". Her phrasing received criticism from conservative and right-wing politicians in Germany as demonstrating un-professionalism, and criticism from Russia. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman underlined that Germany was not a party to the conflict and the speech was in a context of establishing a unified stance in opposition to a war of aggression.In March 2023, on a visit to Baghdad, Baerbock called on Iran to cease its missile attacks on Iraqi territory.In May 2023, she urged China to take a clear stance in the war in Ukraine, saying ""neutrality means taking the side of the aggressor."", after the Chinese President first visited in Russia Vladimir Putin, and later on the next day visited Ukraine, with offending Russian dissidents and opponents of Vladimir Putin while being in Ukraine.Also she named the Chinese President Xi a dictator next to Vladimir Putin this September, but that also followed the US President referring to the Chinese President a dictator on June. 
In May 2023, she visited Saudi Arabia and praised Saudi efforts to find a solution to the wars in Yemen and Sudan.On 6 July 2023, US President Joe Biden authorized the provision of cluster munitions to Ukraine in support of a Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces in Russian-annexed southeastern Ukraine. Baerbock opposed the decision of the Biden administration to supply cluster munitions to Ukraine.In September 2023, Baerbock accused Azerbaijan of breaking its promise not to resort to military action in Armenian-held Nagorno-Karabakh and called on it to halt the offensive and return to negotiations. In February 2024, she hosted the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia for two days of peace talks in Berlin.Baerbock expressed support for Israel and its right to self-defense during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. On 23 October 2023, she blocked a declaration by EU ministers calling for ""an immediate humanitarian cease-fire"" to help civilians in the Gaza Strip. On 11 November 2023, she visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. Baerbock rejected calls for a ceasefire but supported ""humanitarian pauses"" to deliver aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. She stated that ""For Germany, Israel's security is non-negotiable."" She pointed to Germany's ""historic and moral responsibility to the Jewish people and the Israeli state"" because of the Holocaust. She and UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron wrote a joint article published in The Sunday Times on 17 December 2023 calling for actions which would ""pav[e] the way to a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza"".


== Political positions ==


=== Foreign policy ===
Baerbock is regarded as taking a centrist line on defense and pushing for a stronger common EU foreign policy, especially against Russia and China. She has proposed a post-pacifist foreign policy, calling for a European army under the supervision of the European Parliament and outlining steps toward Germany's denuclearization in consultation with allies. She supports NATO's eastward expansion and cooperation with the United States. In November 2020, she said: ""Europe has been revolving around itself for years, the Trump administration turned its back on the world. Authoritarian states fill the gap that emerged. That leads to Russia or Turkey becoming active in our neighborhood – and the EU, as in the case of Nagorno-Karabakh, is left out."" In December 2021, Baerbock proposed a ""values-driven"" foreign policy in conjunction with other European democracies and NATO partners, and called on the EU to implement sanctions against Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik.Baerbock appears to have taken a pro-Israel stance in response to the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis. She called the number of UN resolutions criticizing Israel ""absurd compared to resolutions against other states."" Baerbock expressed ""concern"" over the legal and constitutional implications of the proposed 2023 Israeli judicial reform.


=== Energy, climate and environmental policy ===
Baerbock has argued in favor of a European and trans-Atlantic Green Deal. She has cited a need for technology transfer so that countries worldwide can limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 °C, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.Baerbock has called for coal to be phased out in Germany by 2030, the implementation of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour (81 mph), and restricting the registration of cars to emission-free cars ""by 2030 at the latest"". She has said that ""agricultural subsidies should be oriented towards the common good"" and that animal populations and meat production should be ""reduced very significantly"". Baerbock has also said that ""climate policy is not in contradiction to the economy"" and that she wishes to preserve Germany's status as an industrial location ""into the 21st century – in light of the Paris climate agreement."" She supports the production of climate-neutral steel and has expressed support for climate tariffs – international taxes on goods that are carbon-intensive. Under her policies, domestic German flights are to be made ""superfluous"" by 2035, by strengthening the rail network.When the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the greenhouse gas reductions set out in the Climate Protection Act were insufficient on 29 April 2021, Baerbock held out the prospect of setting concrete greenhouse gas savings targets in the event that her party would participate in the federal government. She also called for the quota for the annual expansion of renewable energy sources to be doubled by the mid-2020s. Baerbock has said that environmental destruction caused by climate change is becoming increasingly expensive.Baerbock opposes the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project between Russia and Europe.Baerbock is an opponent of nuclear power.

The decision for non-re-election to the Portuguese Parliament came from PSD-Madeira's president, Miguel Albuquerque, and the regional party's Political Commission as a result from the negotiations made with PSD regarding the Closed lists.

46,"Maria Böhmer (born 23 April 1950) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Under the leadership of successive ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2013-2017) and Sigmar Gabriel (2017), she served as Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office, primarily responsible for cultural relations and education policy.


== Early life and education ==
Born into a family of wine growers, and after graduating high school in 1968, Böhmer studied mathematics, physics, political science and education. In 1971 she passed the state examination, and received her doctorate Dr. phil. In 1974 from the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz. Upon receiving her PhD, she conducted research at the universities of Cambridge and Augsburg and gained a post-doctoral qualification in education at the University of Mainz in 1982. In 1993/94, Christian Baldauf was a research associate to her. Since 2001, she has held the title of Associate Professor of Education at Heidelberg University of Education, but does not currently teach there.


== Political career ==
From 1982 to 1990, Böhmer served as State Commissioner for Women in Rhineland Palatinate. Böhmer joined the CDU in 1985. She is a member of the Women's Union, the Local Politics Association of the CDU and CSU of Germany, and the Christian Democratic Employees' Association. From 1990, she was a member of the Bundestag as well as of the Federal Executive Board of the CDU.
Between 1994 and 1998, Böhmer served on the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs as well as on the Committee on Family Affairs. From 2000, she was part of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group's leadership, first under chairman Friedrich Merz (2000–02) and later under chairwoman Angela Merkel (2002–05). From 2001, she served as Chairwoman of the Frauenunion, the CDU's women's organisation. In this capacity, she later publicly endorsed Merkel as the party's candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in the 2002 federal elections; instead, Edmund Stoiber ended up being the joint candidate of CDU and CSU.In 2003, Böhmer was part of a group assigned by then-opposition leader and CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel to draft alternative proposals for social welfare reform in response to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's ""Agenda 2010"". The so-called Herzog Commission – named after its chairman, former German President Roman Herzog – recommended a comprehensive package of reform proposals including, among other things, decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people's earnings and levying a lump monthly sum across the board instead.


=== Minister of State for Integration in the Federal Chancellery, 2005–13 ===
Following the 2005 federal elections, Böhmer was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement. In November 2005, she joined the first cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel and became Minister of State for Integration in the Federal Chancellery and German Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration. In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2009 federal elections, she led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on families, integration of immigrants and culture.
In 2010, Böhmer proposed to introduce legally binding quotas to boost the low number of people with immigrant backgrounds in public sector jobs, saying it would ensure that the public service sector better mirrored the country's population; however, Germans politicians – both from Böhmer's own conservative Christian Democratic Party as well as from the centre-left opposition – opposed the measure. With a focus on improving the integration of the country's immigrant population, Böhmer later that year rejected the conservative MEP Markus Ferber's call for having immigrants undergo intelligence tests before they are granted residency or citizenship rights in the country. In tackling Germany's shortage of qualified workers, Böhmer favours targeting highly qualified foreign workers through measures such as lowering the minimum wage threshold for migrant workers. Since 2010, Böhmer has been the patron of the German version of anti-racism education charity Show Racism the Red Card.After the deaths of nine Turkish citizens in a fire at a Ludwigshafen house on 3 February 2008, which media reports said may have been the result of arson involving neo-Nazis, Böhmer visited the fire site with Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 2010, Böhmer accompanied Chancellor Merkel on a two-day state visit to Turkey. On the occasion of the German government's official celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement in 2011, Böhmer – together with Merkel and Erdoğan – thanked the first Turkish guest workers for their services to Germany. When Erdoğan in 2011 called on the large Turkish community living in Germany to teach their children the Turkish language first and then German, Böhmer countered that ""[o]nly those with good German have opportunities to advance in our country."" In a controversy surrounding a neo-Nazi terrorist cell trial in 2013, she called on the Munich Higher Regional Court to give Turkish media access to the trial.


=== Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office, 2014–2018 ===
Following the 2013 federal elections, Böhmer was again part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement.
As Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office, Böhmer was primarily responsible for cultural relations and education policy as well as of the Asia and South America regions. In 2015, she served as chairwoman of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. When Böhmer’s term as chairwoman ended, Steinmeier appointed her as Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes.During her time in office, Böhmer witnessed the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro (CAB) between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front on 27 March 2014 at the Malacañang Palace in Manila. As Germany's official representative, she took part in the inauguration ceremony for Chilean President Michelle Bachelet on 11 March 2014. Since 2014, she has accompanied German President Joachim Gauck on state visits to the Czech Republic (May 2014), Luxembourg (November 2014), Tanzania (February 2015), Peru (March 2015), and Ireland (July 2015).In September 2016, Böhmer announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.She is one of the 75 Union MPs - 68 from the CDU (26.9% of all CDU MPs) and 7 from the CSU (12.5% of all CSU MPs) - who voted in favor of same-sex marriage at the end of June 2017.

61,"Christine Ann Buchholz (born 2 April 1971 in Hamburg) is a German politician and was member of the Bundestag, the German federal diet from 2009 to 2021 for the Die Linke. A progressive activist, Bucholz is a member of Marx21, a network of trotskyists within Die Linke broadly aligned with the International Socialist Tendency.


== Education and early career ==
From 1991 to 1998, Buchholz studied education and social sciences with a focus on politics and religion at the University of Hamburg. After the state examination she took up a supplementary study of science history. Since 1995 she has also worked in Hamburg and Berlin as an assistant for people with disabilities. From 1997 to 2001 she was a member of the works council in a Hamburg nursing company. She was certified as ötv - Vertrauensfrau (trusted woman) and is a member of the union ver.di. From 2002 she worked as a freelance editor and from 2005 to 2009 as a research assistant to a member of the left parliamentary group Linksfraktion.


== Political career ==
Since the early 1990s she has been active in the antifascist scene. In 1994 she became a member of the Trotskyist organization Linksruck. From 1994 to 1999 she was a member of the SPD. She was active early in the anti-globalization movement and became a member of Attac. She was one of the organizers of the European Social Forum, the Social Forum in Germany and the protests against the G8 summit in Heiligendamm (2007). She participated in the organization and implementation of the Blockupy protests against ""banking power and the austerity of the EU troika"". In the Bundestag she spoke against austerity, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Fiscal Compact.
Buchholz proposed in early 2013 that politicians of the other two (former) opposition parties SPD and Greens should seek political compromises. With a view to the federal election in 2013 (and apparently on the subject of a red-red-green coalition), she said that there is no substantive basis for a government participation because of the support of foreign operations of the Bundeswehr and the approval of Angela Merkel's EU austerity.
Through her membership in Linksruck (dissolved in 2007) she joined the WASG, whose extended federal board she belonged from spring 2005. In March 2007, she was elected to the executive WASG board. Since the Unification Party Convention on 16 June 2007 she is a member of the executive party executive committee of the left, where she is responsible for peace and disarmament.
Buchholz is (as of 2008) a supporter of the Trotskyist organization Marx21 within Die Linke and was the author of the magazine of the same name.
Buchholz is considered a protagonist of the left party wing within the party Die Linke. In 2011, she criticized the attempt by reformers such as Stefan Liebich to change the foreign policy foundations of the party.

== Early life and education ==
Harms was born in Berlin on September 29, 1946. After completing the Abitur in Frankfurt am Main in February 1966, she started studying law at the University of Heidelberg and later at the University of Hamburg, where she did her first state exam in April 1971, followed by the second one in March 1974. Between 1971 and 1974 she also had her judicial clerkship (""Referendariat"") in Hamburg.


== Career ==
After graduating, Harms worked as a prosecutor in Hamburg until she became a judge at the regional court (""Landgericht"") of Hamburg. Between 1983 and 1987 she was a judge at the Fiscal Court Hamburg (Finanzgericht). Afterwards she was appointed as a judge at the Federal Court of Justice in 1987, where she later became a presiding judge as well. She became the Attorney General of Germany in June 2006, an office which she held until reaching the age limit in 2011.
During her time in office, she played a crucial role in Germany's fight against terrorism. In April 2007, Harms announced that the government would not pursue charges against Donald Rumsfeld and 11 other U.S. officials in connection with the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, stating the accusations did not apply, in part because there was insufficient evidence that the acts occurred on German soil, and because the accused did not live in Germany. In September 2007, following a six-month investigation, her office stopped a major terrorist attack against American and German targets by arresting three Islamic militants and seizing a large amount of potentially explosive chemicals and military-grade detonators.In another much-discussed move in 2008, Harms overturned Marinus van der Lubbe's conviction of setting the 1933 Reichstag fire, after a lawyer in Berlin alerted her to the fact that he had yet to be exonerated under a law passed in 1998. The law allowed pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the concept that Nazi law ""went against the basic ideas of justice"".


== Other activities ==
Harms, who is considered an expert in law regarding fiscal offences also works as a lecturer at the Ministry of Finance's Bundesfinanzakademie since 1990, and she held various other lectureships. In January 2008 she became an honorary professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg.

Biography at the German Bundestag"
76,"Gerda Hasselfeldt (born 7 July 1950) is a German politician of the Christian Social Union (CSU) who served as deputy chairperson of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group and chairwoman of the Bundestag group of CSU parliamentarians. Following her departure from active politics, she became President of the German Red Cross in 2018.


== Political career ==
An economist by training, Hasselfeldt first became a Member of the German Bundestag after the 1987 federal elections. She was appointed Federal Minister for Regional Planning, Building and Urban Development by then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a cabinet reshuffle two years later.From 1991, Hasselfeldt served as Federal Minister for Health. She announced her resignation on 27 April 1992, saying the arrest of her close aide Reinhard Hoppe for allegedly spying for Poland had damaged her health. She was succeeded by Horst Seehofer.Hasselfeldt was financial policy spokeswoman for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group for seven years. In 2002, she became the first deputy chairwoman of the parliamentary group, under the leadership of chairwoman Angela Merkel. During the 2005 election campaign, she took charge of agriculture, consumer protection and the environment in Merkel’s nine-member shadow cabinet.After the federal elections in 2005 and 2009, Hasselfeldt was elected Vice President of the German Bundestag. She held this office until she was elected to the head of the Bundestag group of CSU parliamentarians in 2011, succeeding Hans-Peter Friedrich. From 2011 until 2017, she led the group with her co-chair from the CDU, Volker Kauder.
In that capacity, Hasselfeldt was also a member of the parliament's Council of Elders, which – among other duties – determines daily legislative agenda items and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation. Hasselfeldt also served on the Committee on the Election of Judges, which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. From 2014, she was also a member of a parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the other Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG).In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2013 federal elections, Hasselfeldt was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Angela Merkel, Horst Seehofer and Sigmar Gabriel.In April 2016, Hasselfeldt announced that she would not stand in the 2017 federal elections and, instead, resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.


== Life after politics ==
From 2018 until 2019, Hasselfeldt served on the German government's so-called coal commission, which is tasked to develop a masterplan before the end of the year on how to phase-out coal and create a new economic perspective for the country's coal-mining regions. In 2019, she was appointed by Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller as co-chair (alongside Bärbel Dieckmann) of a commission in charge of drafting recommendations on how to address the causes of displacement and migration.


== Political views ==


=== Social policy ===
When members of the Merkel's Christian Democrats in 2012 called on parliament to grant gay couples the same tax benefits as married heterosexuals, Hasselfeldt successfully railed against the idea. ""Marriage between a man and a woman must be especially protected because it is fundamentally oriented towards the propagation of life —which isn't the case in homosexual relationships,"" said Hasselfeldt. In June 2017, she voted against Germany's introduction of same-sex marriage.In a 2012 letter to Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, Hasselfeldt asked the online retailer to suspend sales of a children's puzzle bearing the image of the crematorium at the Dachau concentration camp, calling the product 'a slap in the face' for Holocaust victims. Just 12 miles (19 km) from the Bavarian capital of Munich, Dachau lies within Hasselfeldt's constituency.In 2014, Hasselfeldt publicly rejected complaints against her party over its slogan ""those who commit fraud will be [kicked] out"" - a claim that migrant workers could exploit social welfare.


=== European policies ===
A proponent of strict austerity policies during the Eurozone crisis, Hasselfeldt helped organize a majority of German lawmakers to approve a series of measures to assist Greece recover from its government debt crisis. In 2011, she demanded that Italy must do more to convince financial markets of its creditworthiness after a rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's. In 2013, she said Germany was watching France ""with a degree of concern"" and criticized French President François Hollande for not implementing spending cuts and structural reforms with ""sufficient vigor."" In a reaction to the European Commission's decision to give France two extra years to cut its deficit in early 2015, Hasselfeldt wrote to the body's president Jean-Claude Juncker in a letter to say that the timing of the decision – coinciding with the euro zone vehemently urging Greece to stick to rules set by the Eurogroup despite significant domestic resistance – ""should not create the dangerous impression that we want to apply double standards,"" and that the same rules needed to apply to all countries whatever their size.Criticizing Herman Van Rompuy's 2012 road map for a eurozone-wide fiscal policy, Hasselfeldt rejected proposals for a ""eurozone fiscal capacity"", arguing the idea looked to her like a ""transfer union.""In the context of Turkey's largely failed attempted to ban microblogging service Twitter in 2014, Hasselfeldt reaffirmed that ""[her] position has always been that Turkey should not be allowed into the EU, and that we are pursuing the principle of privileged partnership."" In 2016, Hasselfeldt warned that Britain should not expect to have preferential treatment in case of a Brexit, saying ""to me, it is clear: exit means exit. Citizens have to know that with this decision there will be no special treatment for Britain.""


=== NSA surveillance and Edward Snowden ===
In 2014, Hasselfeldt blocked an opposition bid to bring Edward Snowden to Germany to testify, saying that inviting Snowden to Germany would harm relations with the U.S. and probably force the German government to extradite him to face U.S. espionage charges for unveiling National Security Agency data on surveillance.

77,"Barbara Havliza (born 13 March 1958 in Dortmund) is a German judge and politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who has been serving as State Minister of Justice in the government of Minister President Stephan Weil of Lower Saxony since November 2017.


== Early life and education ==
Havliza attended the Mallinckrodt-Gymnasium in her hometown and graduated in 1976. She then studied law at the Wilhelms-Universität in Münster.


== Early career ==
After her legal clerkship, Havliza worked as a lawyer in Osnabrück and, from 1987 onwards, as a judge and prosecutor in the district courts of Oldenburg and Osnabrück. In 1995, she was a member of the III. Grand Criminal Division of the district court of Osnabrück, which sentenced Bernhard M. to 4+1⁄2 years' imprisonment for rape of his niece in four cases, in spite of his declarations of innocence. After the convict had served his sentence in full, this verdict was overturned in the context of a retrial by the Oldenburg district court due to flagrant deficiencies that had already become evident during the original court hearings, and Bernhard M. was rehabilitated (in the so-called miscarriage of justice of Adolf S. and Bernhard M.). In an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Havliza commented retrospectively: ""This shows how fallible one is, which is why I am convinced that it would be better to acquit one unjustly than to convict one wrongfully.""
In 2001, Havliza was appointed presiding judge at the Regional Court of Osnabrück and, among other things, was a chairwoman of a jury court there. In this capacity, she was also involved with biker gang crime. In 2007, she became director of the district court of Bersenbrück.Between 2007 and 2017, Havliza was a judge at the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf in a Senate for terrorism and organized crime (Staatsschutz), also as its chairwoman from 2010. In 2012, she succeeded Ottmar Breidling as chairwoman of the prestigious sixth Staatsschutz Senate. In her time as chairwoman, Havliza led several important trials, such as those against the alleged al-Qaida terrorists of the ""Düsseldorf Cell,"" against the would-be assassin of Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker, and against a Syria returnee from the Lohberger Brigade. The first time the sixth Senate convicted the wife of a jihadist for supporting a terrorist group, was under the chairmanship of Havliza. As an assessor, Havliza had already convicted the members of the so-called Sauerland Group in 2010. Havliza was the target of death threats from the Islamist spectrum multiple times.Media observers described Havliza's trials as efficient and with a good sense of the feelings of the defendants. Her judgments were rated as rather hard.


== Political career ==
In the election campaign before the 2017 Lower Saxony state election, Havliza belonged to the shadow cabinet of the CDU. After the election and the coalition negotiations with the SPD, she was nominated by Bernd Althusmann as Minister of Justice in the new grand coalition and took office on 22 November 2017. As one of the state's representatives at the Bundesrat, she also serves on the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Havliza supports, among other things, more security in the courts, a ban on religious symbols in the judicial bench, faster procedures in juvenile criminal law, and the restriction of full-scale veiling in court. She is one of the first judiciary politicians in Germany who also advocates a legal review of the so-called abuse study of the Catholic Church published in September 2018.In September 2018 Havliza was elected treasurer of the CDU in Lower Saxony with 94.7 percent approval.In November 2021, Havliza announced that she would not stand in the 2022 state elections.

== Personal life ==
Heiligenstadt is married and lives with her husband and daughter in Gillersheim, a district of the municipality of Katlenburg-Lindau. Her father was a roofer.


== Politics ==


=== Political beginnings and in Lower Saxony's state politics ===
Frauke Heiligenstadt has been a member of the SPD since 1982. From 1993 to 2001, she was chairwoman of the SPD local association Gillersheim (municipality of Katlenburg-Lindau). Since 2003, she has been a member of the executive committee of the SPD district of Hanover, and since 2019, she has been chairwoman of the SPD sub-district of Northeim-Einbeck.
From 1986 to 2011 she was a member of the local council Gillersheim, from 1999 to 2006 local mayor. From 1991 to 2013 she was a member of the municipal council of Katlenburg-Lindau, from 1996 to 2011 she was an alderman and from 2006 to 2011 deputy mayor. Since 2006 she has been a member of the district council of the Northeim district and since 2018 its chairwoman.
For the electoral district of Northeim, Frauke Heiligenstadt has been a member of the Lower Saxony state parliament since 2003. There she was until 2013 spokeswoman for cultural and school policy. Since 2017 she is spokeswoman for budget and fiscal policy.
From 2013 to 2017, she was Lower Saxony's Minister of Culture in the Weil I cabinet, a member of the Bundesrat and Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the Lower Saxony Memorials Foundation in Celle.


=== In the German Bundestag ===
In the 2021 Bundestag election, Heiligenstadt stood as a direct candidate in the constituency of Goslar - Northeim - Osterode and in 10th place on the SPD state list. She won the direct mandate for her constituency  and thus belongs to the 20th German Bundestag. She resigned her state parliament mandate; Renate Geuter moved up for her.
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Heiligenstadt was among the supporters of a general vaccination requirement in Germany.


== Criticism ==
The state government's school policy increasingly brought Heiligenstadt into the media from August 2013. One particularly controversial measure was the increase in the number of compulsory hours for grammar school teachers by one lesson, which brought her criticism from teachers' associations, especially as she rejected investigations into teachers' actual working hours on the grounds that ""you can't gain any insights with bookkeeping"". As a result, the high school teachers refused to continue to organize free class trips, which they are not obliged to do under Lower Saxony school law. With the support of the Philologists' Association and the Education and Science Union (GEW) several teachers successfully sued against the controversial decree before the Higher Administrative Court of Lüneburg. The reason given for the ruling against the state of Lower Saxony on 9 June 2015, was the lack of an investigation into the actual workload of teachers; the increase in working hours for Lower Saxony's high school teachers issued by Heiligenstadt was declared unlawful, as the state of Lower Saxony had violated its duty of care toward teachers. Since then, there has also been sporadic internal criticism of the Red-Green state government's course in school policy.Also at odds with Heiligenstadt's controversial decree on working hours was her own earlier criticism as an opposition politician in 2009: at that time, she was still denouncing the overwork of Lower Saxony's teachers by the CDU and urgently calling for teachers' workloads to be reduced.In May 2015, when students from the Gymnasium in Brake protested Heiligenstadt's school policies on their school's homepage, criticizing the shortage of teachers, the devaluation of the Abitur, and the increase in the number of compulsory hours for Gymnasium teachers, the Lower Saxony state education authority intervened and, by official order, had the article on the school homepage and a link to an article in the local press reporting on the Brake students' protest against the hours increase deleted. This censorship by the school board, which had been coordinated with the Minister of Education, was only withdrawn after massive protests and critical reports in the national press. The principal was nevertheless summoned to a disciplinary meeting.

85,"Kirsten Heisig (August 24, 1961, Krefeld – June 28, 2010, Berlin) was a German  juvenile magistrate.  Heisig was criticized by parts of the political left and parts of the Arabic community for her statements and for her view that some foreign cultures neglect education and encourage juvenile delinquency.  As a juvenile magistrate for Neukölln, an area with a crime rate 40% above the average of Berlin, she initiated the Neukölln model (Neuköllner Modell) that streamlined procedures and targeted an appearance before court within 3–5 weeks after the deed had been committed for deeds punishable by a maximum imprisonment of 4 weeks. Other key elements were encounters between delinquent and victim and community service and a cooperation between legal organs and social workers. This model was extended to the entire city of Berlin in June 2010 and caught attention on a national level.
She was found dead in the forest near Heiligensee on the 3rd of July, 2010; after a search of five days. The public prosecutor at first imposed a total news embargo but then quickly announced that Heisig had committed suicide.The alleged suicide happened shortly after her submission of the manuscript of her book: Das Ende der Geduld: Konsequent gegen jugendliche Gewalttäter. (trans. When Patience Comes to an End: Consistent Actions Against Juvenile Offenders). Blurb from the dust jacket: ""Wenn wir nicht rasch und konsequent handeln, wenn wir unsere Rechts- und Werteordnung nicht entschlossen durchsetzen, werden wir den Kampf gegen die Jugendgewalt verlieren."" (trans. ""If we do not react swiftly and decisively, if we do not preserve our legal structures and values, we will lose our struggle against juvenile violence.""). It became a best-seller in Germany for several weeks.

=== Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister of Finance, 1998–2007 ===

The resulting legislation that passed the cabinet in April 2015 softened her line somewhat, restricting fracking until 2019, after which commercial fracking could only go forward after passing various tough regulatory hurdles. The legislation, however, allows fracking for deep-lying or ""tight"" gas, a technology that has been used for decades in Germany.By early 2016, Hendricks entered in talks with various stakeholders on drawing up a plan over how to exit coal-fired power generation in Germany, later named 'Climate Action Plan 2050'.

91,"Susanne Hennig-Wellsow (born Hennig on 13 October 1977) is a German politician.  She was federal co-chairwoman of The Left from 2021 to 2022 and has served as a member of the Bundestag for Thuringia since 2021. Previously, she was a member of the Landtag of Thuringia from 2004 to 2021, leader of the Thuringia branch of The Left since November 2013, and leader of the state parliamentary group since December 2014.


== Early life and education ==
Hennig-Wellsow was born Susanne Hennig in Demmin in 1977, then a town in East Germany. Her father did military service in the National People's Army and subsequently worked as a truck driver and police officer. Her mother was a registrar and worked in the Ministry of the Interior from the mid-1990s. Hennig graduated from Erfurt Sports High School in 1996. From 1984 to 1999, she was a competitive athlete in speed skating. In 1996, Hennig began studying educational science at the University of Erfurt, which she completed in 2001 as a graduate teacher. Hennig-Wellsow is married, has one child, and lives in Erfurt.


== Political career ==
In 2001, Hennig began working for the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) parliamentary group as a research assistant for education and the media. In the 2004 Thuringian state election, she was elected to the Landtag on the PDS party list. Hennig became a member of The Left after the PDS merged into the new party, alongside left-wing dissidents (Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative) from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 2007. At this time, she co-founded the internal Anti-Capitalist Left faction but later left.In the 2009 Thurinigian state election, Hennig was re-elected to the Landtag, this time as member for the Erfurt II constituency; she defeated incumbent Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) deputy Michael Panse to win the seat. In November 2011, Hennig became deputy leader of the Thuringia branch of The Left.At the Left party conference in Suhl held from 16 to 17 November 2013, Hennig was elected leader of the party. She won 76 of 134 delegate votes (56.7%) against two other candidates. She was re-elected to the Landtag as representative for Erfurt II in the 2014 Thuringian state election, winning 31.0% of votes.
After Bodo Ramelow was elected Minister-President in December 2014, Hennig-Wellsow succeeded him as leader of the Left parliamentary group. At a party conference in Gotha in November 2015, she was re-elected as party leader with 75.4% of votes. This was met with controversy, as it is unusual within The Left for the leadership of both the party and parliamentary group to be held by the same person. An amendment to prevent this practice was proposed but defeated, and Hennig-Wellsow retained both positions. She was re-elected once again in 2017 with 85% of votes. Hennig-Wellsow was re-elected to the Landtag in the 2019 Thuringian state election with an increased majority of 32.7%. Two weeks later in November, she was re-elected as party leader.In September 2020, Hennig-Wellsow announced her candidacy for the co-leadership of the federal Left party. She also welcomed the candidacy of Janine Wissler, and expressed her hope for the election of an all-female co-leadership. She stated that she would move out of state politics and seek election to the Bundestag if confirmed as party chair. Hennig-Wellsow was elected federal co-chairwoman at a party conference on 27 February 2021, winning 70.5% of votes cast.Hennig-Wellsow was The Left's candidate for Erfurt – Weimar – Weimarer Land II in the 2021 German federal election. She was elected as candidate with 93% of votes. She chose not to seek her party's lead candidacy in the federal election, stating that her focus was on winning the Erfurt-Weimar constituency and preparing the party for a possible red–red–green coalition (R2G). Hennig-Wellsow won 16.4% of votes in the election, placing fourth. She was elected to the Bundestag in first position on the Thuringia state list.On 20 April 2022, Hennig-Wellsow resigned as co-leader with immediate effect. She cited personal reasons and the party's poor handling of accusations of sexism within its ranks. She also stated that the party needed new faces for a renewal.


== Political positions ==
Hennig-Wellsow is considered to be on the pragmatic wing of The Left, and describes herself as supporting a ""radical Realpolitik"". She is particularly open to cooperation with other parties, and has voiced strong support for her party's involvement in the federal government, stating: ""If you don't show that you want to govern, you will never succeed."" She has expressed preference for a R2G coalition with the SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens but stated that her primary goal is a federal government without the CDU/CSU.Contrary to The Left's longstanding policy, Hennig-Wellsow does not support German withdrawal from NATO. She has also taken a more hostile attitude toward Russia than others in her party, including in regards to Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria, and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.


== Assessment ==
Hennig-Wellsow is considered adept at negotiation and mediation. As party leader in Thuringia, she played a key role in the formation and development of the R2G governments of Ramelow. She is also noted for her bold, sometimes aggressive tone; during the 2019 state election campaign, she coined the phrase ""Bodo or barbarism!"", which became a slogan of the Left's campaign. On one occasion during the 2020 Thuringian government crisis, Hennig-Wellsow responded to CDU demands with the message: ""Our view remains: the first ballot has to pass with a democratic majority. Otherwise we won't put Bodo Ramelow up. OK. Good day!"" Nonetheless, she played a key role in negotiating the ""constructive opposition"" agreement with the CDU. Deutschlandfunk described her as ""almost the only one who gave the impression that she had a clear plan"".Hennig-Wellsow rose to national prominence during the February 2020 government crisis in Thuringia. After Thomas Kemmerich (Free Democratic Party) was controversially elected Minister-President with the support of Alternative for Germany, the leaders of the parliamentary groups were invited to congratulate him and present him with a bouquet of flowers. As the leader of the largest group, Hennig-Wellsow was the first in line; however, she refused to shake his hand, instead dropping the bouquet at his feet and walking away in protest. The incident was widely reported nationally and internationally, becoming the most iconic image of the crisis. RND described it as ""a moment for the history books"".Hennig-Wellsow was widely criticized for an interview she conducted on 4 March 2021, during which she asserted that she was against the German military being involved in ""combat missions"" abroad but was unable to say how many active combat missions Germany was engaged in at that time and tried to appeal to a member of staff for assistance answering further questions about German military activity. Hennig-Wellsow received further criticism for her interview with Markus Lanz, aired on 31 March 2021, during which she struggled to answer basic facts about The Left's tax proposals.
