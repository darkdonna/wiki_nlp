== Biography ==
Temmerman has worked in various locations around the world for the health and rights of women and children. Most of her work is in the academic and political international arena, particularly in collaboration with United Nations organizations, such as WHO and UNFPA, as well as the European Union, the African Union, national governments in Europe and Africa, as well as with media and civil society.
Temmerman's diverse skills in academics, science, management and politics, in conjunction with her work in the area of women, children and adolescents' health and rights, led The Lancet to call her ""a polymath in reproductive health"". Her advocacy efforts for women's health and rights inspired the Irish rock band U2, during their concert on 1 August 2017 in the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels, to include her in the list of inspiring women (""Women of the World Unite"") who were put in the spotlight during the song ""Ultra Violet (Light My Way)"".


=== Professional career ===
Temmerman studied Medicine at Ghent University in Belgium. This choice was primarily made out of social engagement. Her first contact with Africa during an internship in Butare, Rwanda, in 1975 raised her interest in the health and rights of women living in low- and middle-income countries.


==== Early career ====
Trained in obstetrics and gynaecology, tropical medicine and public health, Temmerman was a junior researcher in the 1980s and later a research leader and mentor.

Back in Belgium in 1992, Temmerman founded the International Centre for Reproductive Health (ICRH) at Ghent University, which has sister research organizations in Kenya (ICRHK) and Mozambique (ICRHM) and a large global collaborative academic network. ICRH obtained research funding from the European Commission, the Belgian development cooperation (DGD, BTC]), the Flemish development cooperation (VLIR, FICA), the Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University and other organizations. Many of these research activities took place in sub-Saharan Africa and involved implementation research on a broad range of sexual and reproductive health issues, including HIV/AIDS. In addition, research collaborations were set up with other European countries, China, India, Central and Latin America, Australia and the Russian Federation. ICRH is a WHO Collaborating Centre on Reproductive Health since 2004, and a UNFPA preferential partner.
Since 1995, she has been a full professor of OB/GYN at Ghent University in Belgium, currently with leave of absence. During her over 30 years of clinical work as an obstetrician she supervised over 18,000 births in many parts of the world. She established a worldwide network of universities in the field of reproductive, maternal, newborn and adolescent health, leading to measurable outputs with over 500 publications and around 50 PhD supervisions in Europe, Africa, Latin America and China.


==== World Health Organization ====
In 2012, Temmerman was appointed Director of the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization. RHR is the main instrument within the United Nations system for research in human reproduction and sexual and reproductive health, bringing together policy-makers and programmers, scientists, health care providers, clinicians, consumers and community representatives to identify and address priorities for research to improve sexual and reproductive health.
