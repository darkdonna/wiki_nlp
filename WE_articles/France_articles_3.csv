Shortly after her election, Danièle Obono declared herself to be an alterglobalist, afrofeminist (Black feminism), anti-imperialist, anti-racist, anti-liberal, anti-Islamophobe and pan-Africanist. She also humorously defines herself as a ""Bolsho-Trotsko-Marxist"", from Trotskyism and Marxism (""I have fun claiming these 'isms' when we're told there's no such thing as ideology anymore.""), and adds that although ""Leninism was [her] gateway [...], anarchists are allies.


=== Parliamentary activity ===
Secretary of the Delegation for Overseas France  and vice-chair of the study group on discrimination and LGBTQI-phobia in the world, she chairs the France-Bangladesh friendship group.Opposed to the 2018 Asylum and Immigration Act, she considers it to be ""useless, counterproductive and dangerous"", as it ""separates good migrants from bad ones, exiles to be kept from exiles to be expelled "". On the other hand, the government and Interior Minister Gérard Collomb defend the bill in the name of ""stepping up the fight against illegal immigration"".In a written question to the government in December 2018, she gave her support to Biram Dah Abeid, ""an anti-slavery figure in Mauritania"". On December 3, 2019, as a member of the Law Commission, she tabled a bill on ""stabilising and securing funding and jobs within associations"", which aims to define the subsidy as a ""funding contract standard"" and to extend the powers of the Haut Conseil à la vie associative (High Council for Associative Life) in response to the decline in the number of employees in the associative sector.
In September 2020, she co-signed a bill from the Ecology Democracy Solidarity parliamentary group aimed at strengthening the right to abortion.As part of the France insoumise parliamentary niche in 2021, Danièle Obono defended a proposal for a job guarantee, which should enable any unemployed person who wants to work to have a job paying the basic public sector wage or more. According to the MEP, this system should make it possible to link an ""ecological bifurcation"" with ""social progress"". However, the proposal has been the subject of debate, with Fabien Roussel, national secretary of the PCF, describing it as a ""Soviet-era"" philosophy. The economist Henrik Sterdyniak felt that the measure ""could not meet the actual needs of households"" with jobs of ""mediocre quality. In June 2021, she lent her support to the local residents of the Jardin d’Eole, who organised a demonstration every Wednesday to denounce the situation in the neighbourhood because of the insecurity created by the presence of drug addicts.

She was sworn in on 27 July 2022.


== Controversies ==


=== About freedom of expression ===


==== Pétition of the ""Inrockuptibles"" for artists ====
On 21 June 2017, Danièle Obono was invited to the TV Show called Les Grandes Gueules, in which Alain Marshall blamed her for  a petition signed in 2012 and launched by the cultural magazine Les Inrockuptibles in support of artists' freedom of expression. The petition denounced the indictment of Saïdou, lead singer of the group « Zone d'expression populaire » (ZEP, eng: area of people’s speech), and sociologist Saïd Bouamama following a complaint from the far-right association AGRIF, which criticised the use of the expression ""Nique la France"" in a 2010 song.Danièle Obono explained why she had signed up five years earlier: ""To defend the freedom of expression of these artists, yes. Because that's one of the fundamental freedoms.""Political scientist Laurent Bouvet and Valeurs actuelles portrayed her as being close to another signatory, Houria Bouteldja, a member of the Indigènes de la République, which she disputes. After comments from the far right on her response, a petition against her gathered 5,000 signatures in what Les Inrockuptibles described as a ""polemic with racist overtones"". LFI MP Éric Coquerel expressed surprise that the question had been put specifically to her, because of her skin colour, and not to others who had signed the petition five years earlier, such as Clémentine Autain, Noël Mamère and Eva Joly, but also artists Rachid Taha, Zebda and Siné, trade unionists Élie Domota and Xavier Mathieu and journalist Rokhaya Diallo. On 11 December 2018, the French Supreme Court definitively dismissed all AGRIF's claims against the song.


==== Debate with Manuel Valls ====
In October 2017, a controversy over freedom of expression pitted Obono against Manuel Valls, faced with the appeal of Farida Amrani, LFI candidate narrowly beaten in the legislative elections in the constituency including Évry, a town where Dieudonné had obtained 3.84% in the first round of the 2017 French legislative election.On Europe 1, Valls attributes the following comments to Obono: ""the text she wrote after the attacks of January 2015 (...) when she says that she rather cried for Dieudonné and not for Charlie's victims"". The journalist Patrick Cohen then points out to him that this text is more of a lament, in his view, about the censorship that struck Dieudonné at the end of 2013 than about Dieudonné himself.On November 5, Danièle Obono responded to this controversy on Radio J. She criticized Dieudonné because he was ""racist and anti-Semitic"". Her statement was taken up by AFP, immediately recalling that she had been ""accused of Islamo-leftist drift by Manuel Valls"" and observing that she refers ""to the numerous press releases from the Human Rights League"" for whom the ban on Dieudonné's shows constitutes ""a serious setback to the rule of law, which allows this person to present himself as a victim"".


== Political career ==
Following the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, Obono was at the centre of a controversy after she stated she would ""not cry"", deeming the weekly newspaper's cartoons ""racist"".A member of La France Insoumise, Obono was elected to the National Assembly for the 17th constituency of Paris in the legislative election of 2017. She was a spokesperson for La France Insoumise under the leadership Jean-Luc Mélenchon, together with Alexis Corbière.In the legislature, Obono has served on the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.In November 2017, she was involved in another controversy after she defended union meetings in Seine-Saint-Denis that were closed to white people. After the government announced it would sue the organisers, Obono had an altercation with Mélenchon in the National Assembly, following his support of the government on this matter.In August 2020, the right-wing French magazine Valeurs actuelles published a seven-page fantasy story and illustrations of Obono as a slave in chains facing the sunset, shackled beside a fire, under the title ""summer fantasy story"", prompting an outcry from politicians of various parties.Questioned about Hamas following the terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023, Danielle Obono, told French radio Sud Radio on 17 October that ""yes, Hamas is a resistance movement. It's an Islamist political group that has an armed wing, and is resisting Israel », refusing to qualify it a terrorist organization.
