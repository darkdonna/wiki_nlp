Kaag led a team of one hundred experts who were responsible for ensuring the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles before 30 June 2014.


==== United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon ====
By the end of her term in September 2014, news media reported that Kaag was rumored to succeed Lakhdar Brahimi as UN Special Envoy to Syria. On 1 December 2014, the UN Secretary General Ban announced that Kaag would become the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon (UNSCOL), succeeding Sir Derek Plumbly.In early 2017, Kaag was considered by international media to be one of the candidates to succeed Helen Clark as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and head of the United Nations Development Group; the post eventually went to Achim Steiner.


=== 2017–2024: Minister and D66 party leader ===


==== Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation ====
Following the 2017 Dutch government formation, Kaag was asked for a ministerial post by D66 leader Alexander Pechtold. She was installed as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation on 26 October 2017. After the resignation of Foreign Minister Halbe Zijlstra on 13 February 2018, she was appointed ad interim to succeed him while conserving her other cabinet position. Kaag was consequently the first female Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. She was replaced by Stef Blok as Foreign Minister on 7 March 2018.
From 2018 to 2022, Kaag served on the joint World Bank–WHO Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), co-chaired by Elhadj As Sy and Gro Harlem Brundtland. In 2019, she joined the World Economic Forum High-Level Group on Humanitarian Investing, co-chaired by Børge Brende, Kristalina Georgieva and Peter Maurer.


==== 2021 Dutch general election ====
Soon after joining the cabinet, there was speculation about Kaag's candidacy for the D66 leadership, which had arisen after the resignation of Alexander Pechtold. During this period, she also profiled herself by giving speeches, often outside her own portfolio as a minister.On 21 June 2020, Kaag announced her candidacy for lijsttrekkerschap of the Democrats 66 for the 2021 general election, with the ambition of becoming the Netherlands' first female Prime Minister. Kajsa Ollongren and Rob Jetten were also speculated to stand as candidates, but both refrained from doing so. The only opponent was the unknown member Ton Visser, which resulted in Kaag winning the election with 95.7% of the votes. She was elected as party leader on 4 September 2020, making her the second female party leader of D66 after Els Borst in 1998. In this capacity, she led the party into the 2021 Dutch general election.In the run-up to the election, the VPRO documentary Sigrid Kaag: Van Beiroet tot Binnenhof was broadcast on 3 January 2021. Before this, Kaag had been followed for several years by documentary makers. After the elections, GeenStijl published about the communication between the broadcasting company and D66 about the documentary, which they had obtained via a request for access to government information. This showed that D66 did have a lot of substantive requests, some of which were granted, although this was denied beforehand. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also interfered, including the broadcast date of the documentary. Initially, Kaag indicated that this was not at her request, but soon admitted that she was responsible for it. Following this report, the Dutch Media Authority (Commissariaat voor de Media) stated that there was no reason for further investigation, as editorial independence does not appear to have been violated.D66's campaign for the 2021 general election was successful. Under Kaag's leadership, D66 won 24 seats in the House of Representatives, thereby becoming the second-largest party after the VVD. Kaag joined the House of Representatives as the party's parliamentary leader on 31 March 2021.During a lecture in the Rode Hoed debating centre in September of the same year, she voiced fierce criticism of the political culture that had arisen partly under Mark Rutte's leadership. Shortly after, in April 2021, she joined forces with CDA leader Wopke Hoekstra in putting forward a motion of censure to voice their disapproval of VVD leader Rutte.


==== Minister of Foreign Affairs ====
Due to changes within the outgoing cabinet, Kaag was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on 25 May 2021. She combined this position with her position as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation until 10 August 2021. Thereafter, she was succeeded as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation by another former diplomat, Tom de Bruijn.On 16 September 2021, the House of Representatives passed a motion of censure against her. A majority reproached her for the late evacuation of Dutch citizens and local civilian personnel from Afghanistan amid the 2021 Taliban offensive and Fall of Kabul. In response to the passing of the motion of censure, Kaag announced her intention to resign as minister. King Willem-Alexander granted her resignation on 17 September, and she was succeeded by Ben Knapen.


==== Minister of Finance ====
After she negotiated in the 2021–2022 Dutch cabinet formation, Kaag returned to the fourth Rutte cabinet as Minister of Finance and first Deputy Prime Minister. Days before, a candidate of the Jezus Leeft party had stood outside of Kaag's home with a burning torch, and security measures were subsequently raised. Trouw profiled Kaag as a typical frugal Dutch finance minister who forced spending cuts following years of economic stimulus programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. She called constant compensation untenable in the 2021–2023 global energy crisis, acknowledging citizens would collectively become less wealthy. In her role as Deputy Prime Minister, Kaag had more leeway within the governing coalition to act as a result of frequent international trips by Prime Minister Mark Rutte.Five days after the collapse of the fourth Rutte cabinet, 12 July 2023, Kaag announced in an interview in Trouw that she would not lead D66 into the 2023 general election, due to the impact of the ""hate, intimidation and threats"" her family was receiving. According to the Nederlands Dagblad, these had reached a high point when she had become leader of D66. Its article referenced public perceptions of Kaag as an elitist politician as well as PVV leader Geert Wilders calling her a witch in 2021. She had teared up in May 2023 during a College Tour interview, when she was shown a video message from one of her daughters asking her to leave her job.


=== 2024–present: Return to diplomacy ===
On 26 December 2023, Kaag was announced as the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza. This was the result of the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution to boost humanitarian aid in response to the Israel–Hamas war, which had been ongoing since a Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023 and which had resulted in a siege of Gaza by Israel with significant civilian casualties and destruction as well as scarcity of resources. Kaag's appointment will take effect on 8 January 2024. The UN tasked Kaag to ""facilitate, coordinate, monitor and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza"" and to establish a UN mechanism to accelerate aid deliveries ""through states which are not party to the conflict.""

20,"Sadet Karabulut (born 28 April 1975) is a Dutch politician and former 
civil servant and trade unionist of Kurdish descent. As a member of the Socialist Party (Socialistische Partij), she has been an MP since 30 November 2006. She focuses on matters of social affairs (poverty reduction, social assistance, purchasing power, child benefits), female emancipation, and social integration.


== Biography ==
Karabulut was born as the daughter of a Turkish-Kurdish guest worker. Her parents were of Alevi origin, but at home religion did not play an important role, and in her teens Karabulut decided that she did not believe in God.Karabulut studied public administration at Erasmus University Rotterdam and political science at the University of Bordeaux. She was active in the Dutch National Students' Trade Union (LSVb), and board member at the Orion Foundation (Public Kingma School for special education). Since 2005, she has been a member of the Socialist Party. From March till November 2006, she was a member of the municipal council of Amsterdam.
In February 2013, Karabulut stated she would refuse to pledge loyalty to the soon-to-be-King, Dutch Crown Prince Willem Alexander, during his inauguration ceremony. She cited that the procedure was overly ceremonial as she had already pledged allegiance when she was admitted to the House of Representatives. She is also a convinced republican.From August to November 2013, Karabulut temporarily left the House of Representatives on a maternity leave and was replaced by Tjitske Siderius. She returned later that year. During the 2017 Dutch general election Karabulut was on the SP's candidate list's fifth place. When parliamentary leader Emile Roemer stepped down in 2017, she announced her candidacy to lead the party in his stead. However, the majority of the parliamentary group chose Lilian Marijnissen, former leader Jan Marijnissen's daughter.Karabulut is a leading member of the Dutch branch of the Democratic Workers' Clubs Federation (Demokratik Isci Dernekleri Federasyonu, DIDF).


== Conflict in the Gaza Strip and call for intifada ==
In response to the 2008–09 Gaza War, SP Members of Parliament Harry van Bommel and Karabulut together with Gretta Duisenberg marched in a 3 January 2009 demonstration 3 januari 2009 against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, calling upon Palestinians to launch an intifada (uprising) against Israel. Both chanted the slogan ""Intifada, intifada, free Palestine"". This led to criticism from the VVD, PVV and the Centre Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI, a Zionist organisation). SP parliamentary leader Agnes Kant also reprimanded Van Bommel and Karabulut. On 5 January 2009, Van Bommel stated that their call for an intifada had been misunderstood; he and Karabulut had meant a ""non-violent intifada"".

21,"Hülya Kat (born 1 August 1983) is a Dutch politician, serving as a member of the House of Representatives on behalf of the social liberal party Democrats 66 (D66). She was a member of the Velsen municipal council between 2010 and 2018, when she was elected to the Amsterdam council. Kat won a seat in the House in the 2021 general election.


== Early life and education ==
Kat was born in 1983 in the North Holland port town of IJmuiden to Turkish-born parents, who had come to the Netherlands in 1970. She grew up in that town and in Santpoort-Noord with her two younger brothers, and she attended the Haarlem secondary school Erasmus College. Kat studied law at the University of Groningen between 2002 and 2009 with intellectual property law as specialization and returned to her parents in IJmuiden afterwards.


== Career ==
She joined Democrats 66 in 2009 and first appeared on the ballot in the 2010 municipal election in Velsen as the party's fifth candidate. D66 won four municipal council seats, but Kat was elected despite this result because of her preference votes. At the time, Kat also volunteered at the Velsen animal ambulance. She became chair of the municipality's John van Dijk Fund, which aims to engage young people in politics, shortly after her election. Kat's focus in the council was on safety and public order, and she was re-elected in 2014 as D66's third candidate. She was also placed 38th on the party list in the 2017 general election. Kat received 2,685 preference votes, but she was not elected due to D66 winning nineteen seats.She moved to the Dutch capital of Amsterdam in 2018, while she was working as an HR officer at a cleaning company. Kat was D66's ninth candidate in Amsterdam in the 2018 municipal election, which was held a month after she had left the Velsen municipal council. Her party won eight seats in Amsterdam, but Kat did end up in the municipal council in May 2018, when another D66 member left the council. She became her party's spokesperson for economic affairs, port, airport, and spatial planning and the chair of the mobility, air quality, and water committee. She also started working as a senior staff and organizational advisor at the Amsterdam district court in June 2018.Kat ran again for member of parliament in the 2021 general election, being placed seventeenth on the party list. She received 15,620 preference votes and was sworn into the House of Representatives on 31 March. She was replaced in the Amsterdam municipal council that same day, and she left her job at the district court. In the House, Kat's specializations were poverty, debts, and the childcare benefits scandal, the Participation Act, and law, and she is on the Committees for Credentials, Defence, Finance, Justice and Security (chair), Public Expenditure, and Social Affairs and Employment (vice chair). In October 2021, she also took over Rens Raemakers's position on the committee of the parliamentary inquiry into natural gas extraction Groningen. She was her party's lijstduwer in Amsterdam in the 2022 municipal elections. Following reports in March 2022 about an administrator who had embezzled money from debtors he was managing the finances of, Kat suggested changes to the system. She proposed for municipalities to provide a central point for help in case of high debts, which would create a three-year plan to get out of debt and to prevent a repeat. This is supposed to prevent debts continuing for many years, which could be in the financial interest of the administrator. In late 2022, the House of Representatives passed a motion by Kat to have the government provide free period products to low-income households. Another amendment co-filed by Kat was carried to shorten the term for personal debt restructuring from three to one and a half years.Kat has been part of the board of directors of UNESCO Centrum Nederland, which provides development aid, since 2012.

Before being elected to the House, she served as a municipal councilor and alderwoman in her hometown Rotterdam. Kathmann has also worked in media and at two nonprofit organizations.


== Early life and non-political career ==
She was born in 1978 in Rotterdam as the daughter of an architect and a nurse and grew up in the neighborhood Spangen. She has an older brother and an older sister. Kathmann attended the Rotterdamsch Lyceum at vwo level from 1990 until 1997 and subsequently studied law at Utrecht University. In 1999, she took a job as account manager at the Bureau voor Managementondersteuning, a management consultancy firm, and started studying history of international relations at the same university. Kathmann would finish that study in 2007.She joined the new pragmatic idealistic radio and television broadcaster LLiNK in 2004, the year before it became part of the Dutch public broadcasting system. There, she served as senior editor, host, and correspondent. Kathmann also started working as a voice-over. LLiNK ceased broadcasting in 2010, as the NPO would not carry its programming anymore. That year, she and her then boyfriend established the foundation Jarige Job (Birthday boy), which gifts boxes with supplies to celebrate a birthday to children living in poverty. She served as its director for two years. Simultaneously, she worked as an editor and producer at CCCP, a creator of television programs and marketing content.In 2012, Kathmann became project manager at the Giovanni van Bronckhorst Foundation, which offers a sports education program to help children in their last two years of primary school, when it was founded. She was promoted to director and remained in that position until her appointment as alderwoman in Rotterdam.


== Politics ==
Kathmann was elected to the Rotterdam municipal council in the 2014 municipal elections. She was the Labour Party's second candidate and became deputy caucus leader. In the council, Kathmann focussed on sustainability and mobility. She was her party's lead candidate in the 2018 municipal election in Rotterdam and campaigned on addressing inequality by creating jobs. She was re-elected and became her party's caucus leader.In July 2018, when a new coalition had been formed, she left the council to become alderwoman of economy, neighborhoods, and villages. Kathmann also appeared 41st on the PvdA's party list during the 2019 provincial election in South Holland. As alderwoman, she was responsible for preparing the Hook of Holland ferry for a potential no-deal Brexit. Furthermore, Kathmann started a pilot that turned about 90 retail properties into residential ones in order to combat vacancy. For the same reason, she founded a taskforce to reduce the number of shopping areas and to decrease the sizes of others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kathmann and the alderman of finance announced that entrepreneurs and independent contractors could postpone paying local taxes. She was also involved in Rotterdam's plan to revive the economy, which included a retraining program and €233 million in funding for seven construction projects to add green spaces.


=== House of Representatives ===
She ran for member of parliament in the 2021 general election, being placed seventh on the Labour Party's list. In February 2021, Kathmann resigned from her position as alderwoman to campaign. She was sworn in as House member on 31 March after she had been elected with 4,780 preference votes. Kathmann became the Labour Party's spokesperson for security, justice, and the interior. Her portfolio later changed to social affairs, employment, economic affairs, and climate, and she is a member of the Committees for Digital Affairs; for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy; for the Interior; for Justice and Security; for Kingdom Relations; for Public Expenditure; and for Social Affairs and Employment as well as the Procedure Committee and the parliamentary inquiry into natural gas extraction Groningen. Kathmann is also the secretary of the Labour Party caucus.She wrote an opinion piece with Kati Piri in 2022, in which they stated that corporations had become addicted to migrant workers. According to them, this should be addressed through higher wages and through tackling violations of labor laws. Kathmann also co-filed an amendment to shorten the term for personal debt restructuring from three to one and a half years. It received the support from a majority of the House. In 2023, she continued a 2017 effort by her party to introduce the right to disconnect. She argued that anxiety about short-term contracts was pressuring employees into engaging in work-related activities outside of work hours. To accommodate for occupations that deal with emergencies, the bill would not provide an absolute right to not be disturbed, but it would force employers to have a conversation with their workers. Furthermore, Kathmann successfully defended a bill in the Senate to replace the monthly minimum wage in favor of an hourly one together with Senna Maatoug (GroenLinks). The monthly minimum wage caused full-time employees to receive the same salary whether they worked 36 or 40 hours per week.

23,"Maria Cornelia Gezina ""Mona"" Keijzer (born 9 October 1968) is a Dutch politician and former civil servant. She served as State Secretary for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy alongside Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius from 26 October 2017 until 25 September 2021. As a member of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), she served in the House of Representatives between 2012 and 2017, and again for six months from 31 March 2021 until 27 September 2021. She focused on matters of nursing, home care and culture. Before becoming a full-time politician she worked as an environmental jurist for the municipalities of Waterland and Almere, as well as for the province of Gelderland.


== Early life ==
Keijzer was born in Edam and studied juridical public administration and public law at the University of Amsterdam.


== Career ==
Keijzer started her political career as a member of the municipal council of Waterland from 1996 to 2002 and was later an alderwoman from 1998 to 2006. Subsequently, she worked as a lawyer and mediator in 2005 and 2006. Afterwards she was an alderwoman of neighbouring municipality of Purmerend from 2007 to 2012.
In 2012, Keijzer contested the CDA leadership election in an attempt to become the party's lijsttrekker for the 2012 general election. Although performing unexpectedly well in the elections, she let Sybrand van Haersma Buma go first. Placed second on the list of candidates, Keijzer was elected to the House of Representatives, receiving 127,446 votes. She was reelected in the 2017 general election with 165,384 votes.
On 26 October 2017, Keijzer was appointed State Secretary for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy in the third Rutte cabinet. In this capacity, she was responsible for consumer policy, small and medium-sized enterprises, telecom, post and market regulation.In a joint statement in October 2020, Keijzer and her French counterpart Cédric O called for a European Union authority to regulate large technology companies and argued that such an authority should be able to prevent digital platforms from blocking access to their services ""unless they have an objective justification.""In 2020, she again contested the CDA leadership election, but came third, after Hugo de Jonge and Pieter Omtzigt. Placed seventh on the party's candidate list for the 2021 general election, Keijzer was reelected, obtaining 18,031 votes.
On 25 September 2021 Keijzer was dismissed from her cabinet position after publicly criticising the cabinet's position on COVID-19 measures. While forced resignations are not unheard of, being removed from a cabinet position has little precedent. The last time a cabinet member was fired was in 1975, although in that instance Jan Glastra van Loon was allowed to resign. Before Keijzer's discharge, no other cabinet member had actually been fired since World War II. Media outlets reported that Keijzer refused to resign. Keijzer also resigned from the House of Representatives two days later.On 1 September 2023, Keijzer joined Farmer–Citizen Movement and it was announced that she would be the party's candidate in position two, for the November 2023 election, and also the BBB candidate for the position of Prime Minister.


== Personal life ==
Keijzer is married to a urologist and has five sons. She lives in Ilpendam and belongs to the Catholic Church. Her father-in-law is a former alderman of Waterland for the CDA.

24,"Simone Kerseboom (born 26 April 1984) is a Dutch politician of the conservative populist party Forum for Democracy (FvD). She has been a member of the House of Representatives since the 2021 general election, and she served on the States of Limburg in the years 2019–2023. Kerseboom lived in South Africa for about twenty years and holds a doctorate from Rhodes University.


== Early life and career ==
Kerseboom was born in the North Brabant city of Roosendaal, and she moved with her parents and younger brother in 1996 to South Africa, the country where her mother was born. Her parents had met in South Africa in the 1970s, when her father was working for a dredging project at the port of Port Elizabeth, and he would later become a sea captain. Kerseboom studied history at Rhodes University, obtaining her doctorate after completing her dissertation about the nation state and national identity. Kerseboom returned to the Netherlands in 2015 and started working as an English–Dutch translator, editor, and writer. She owned a business called Novel Translations & Language Services.


== Politics ==
In 2017, Kerseboom wrote an opinion piece on the website ThePostOnline, in which she warned that ""a shared national identity appears to be eroding rapidly"" in the Netherlands. She wrote that ""any remnants of national pride and values are systematically being replaced by a relentless supranationalism accompanied by the politically correct abstract concepts of multiculturalism and diversity which threaten Dutch sovereignty and national cohesion by emphasizing the differences between citizens instead of celebrating what we have in common"".Kerseboom joined Forum for Democracy and was their second candidate in Limburg in the 2019 provincial elections. The party, a newcomer, won seven seats, causing Kerseboom to receive a seat in the States of Limburg. When FvD's lead candidate left the council to become a member of the provincial executive, Kerseboom succeeded him as caucus leader. In November 2020, newspaper Het Parool published an article about extremist ideas held by members of the party's youth wing, which caused a crisis within Forum for Democracy. Four out of the seven FvD members of the States of Limburg left the party, while Kerseboom expressed her continuing support for party leader Thierry Baudet.Forum for Democracy announced the following month that Kerseboom would appear fifth on its party list in the 2021 general election. She was elected, receiving 7,025 preference votes, and entered the House of Representatives on 31 March. She kept her seat in the States of Limburg but stepped down as caucus leader. Kerseboom became her party's spokesperson for foreign affairs, foreign trade, education, culture, and science, and she is on the Committees for Education, Culture and Science; for Foreign Affairs; and for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. She is also part of the contact groups United Kingdom and United States and of the Benelux Interparliamentary Consultative Council. Kerseboom violated social distancing rules – in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic – after holding her maiden speech, when fellow member of parliament Gideon van Meijeren congratulated her by kissing and hugging her.Kerseboom temporarily stepped down as member of the House of Representatives and the States of Limburg starting on 16 August 2022 because of her maternity leave. She extended her House leave after 6 December, but she returned to the States Provincial after the sixteen-week period  Her House leave ended on 28 March 2023. Kerseboom sought a second term as provincial councilor in the March 2023 elections as Forum for Democracy's second candidate. However, her party won only one seat in Limburg, bringing an end to her tenure. Kerseboom was the party's third candidate in the May 2023 Senate election, and she announced that she would leave the House for a Senate membership – a part-time position – if she could not combine motherhood with a House seat. However, Kerseboom was not elected as her party won only one seat in the Senate, and she stayed in the House. She did not run for re-election in the November 2023 general election, citing personal reasons, and appeared on the party list only as a lijstduwer.

== Career before politics ==
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958, she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company ""ZwaTra"", the company of her father.


== Local and national politics ==
Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971, she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981, she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition.

Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.


== After National Politics ==
After her ministerial career, Kroes spent two years working on two projects as an advisor to Karel van Miert, at that time European Commissioner for Transport. She also became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991, Kroes became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001, Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).


== European Commission ==


=== Commissioner for Competition ===
In 2004, Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. At the time, her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group every year between 2005 and 2012.In 2009, she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.


=== Commissioner for Digital Agenda ===
In 2010, she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010.
The Digital Agenda for Europe is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
Since 2010, she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.In 2010, it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011, Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011, due to plagiarism charges – as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.In November 2012, Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.


== Later career ==
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies. For the 2019 European elections, she was brought into the European election campaign by Guy Verhofstadt's Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) in Belgium.In addition, Kroes has been holding a variety of paid and unpaid positions.


== Controversy ==
At the end of the 1980s, intensive research into environmental crime among chemical waste processing companies ended in a fiasco. As Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, Kroes had conceived the plan to provide subsidies to the companies TCA and TCR (Tanker Cleaning Amsterdam and Rotterdam, respectively). Even though she was made aware of the company's criminal activities, including mixing chemical waste into fuel oil, she pushed through with the subsidies. The resulting TCR affair sparked a parliamentary inquiry in 1997. Kroes was accused by the investigative committee that she had helped a rogue company with a government subsidy into the saddle, which made the environmental crimes possible.
In the mid-1990s, Kroes was involved in the frigate affair: the failed purchase of six Dutch frigates (amounting to 1.2 billion euros) by the United Arab Emirates. As chairman of a consortium of Holland Signaal, Ballast Nedam and Koninklijke Schelde (supported by the navy, the Port of Rotterdam Authority and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs), Kroes attempted to exchange the frigates for oil supplies. When it turned out that she was also using her chairmanship to serve the business interests of a personal friend, the businessman Joop van Caldenborgh, she was removed from her position by the government. It was only in 2011 that it became known that she had also put Prince Bernhard forward as a lobbyist in this deal, in violation of the agreements that Bernhard had made with the Den Uyl cabinet after the Lockheed affair. The frigate affair brought Kroes into contact with Jordanian investor Amin Badr-El-Din, with whom she would run the company Mint Holdings some years later, which was planning to take over part of Enron.In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas. As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company. Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014). According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an ""oversight"", and declared that she would take full responsibility.The “Uber files”, leaked documents in 2022, revealing active and irregular efforts of Uber in lobbying regulators, revealed that Kroes prepared her appointment at the taxi company when she was still in office. 
She did not disclose the numerous appointments she had with firms executives when European Commissioner for competition and then new technologies (a position she held until November 2014).  
After resigning from the European Commission, she actively helped Uber bending regulations by opening her contacts to the company, including Netherlands then Prime Minister Mark Rutte, breaking her 18-months duty of réserve that ex commissionner must apply. She finally joins Uber Public Affairs team in 2016.


== Personal life ==
Kroes was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper. She is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.


=== Corporate boards ===
Uber, Member of the Public Policy Advisory Board
Salesforce, Non-Executive Board Board of Directors (since 2016)

The CDA supported the bill only after filing an amendment to initially exclude business with fewer than 10 employees. That same year, the House carried an amendment co-filed by Maatoug to shorten the term for personal debt restructuring from three to one and a half years. It received the support from a majority of the House.

She was born in 1979 in the Overijssel city Enschede, where her parents, Turkish migrant workers, were employed in the textile industry. She has a brother and five sisters. At age three, Mutluer moved with her mother to Turkey, where she resided in the cities Mersin and Adana. Mutluer returned to the Netherlands in 1988 with her mother. There, she lived in the Zaandam neighborhood Poelenburg and attended the high school Zaanlands Lyceum at gymnasium level in the years 1992–98.Mutluer subsequently studied law at the University of Amsterdam, obtaining a Master of Laws degree. During her study, when she was just over twenty years old, she returned to Turkey to intern at an Ankara law firm for four months. After graduating in 2004, Mutluer started teaching law at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and received a grant to research invitations to tender. From 2015 to 2017, she served as a guest lecturer at University College Utrecht. Next to her teaching career, she became a legal professional specialized in invitations to tender and contracts, working for Corvers Procurement Services (2016–17) and for the governmental organization Rijkswaterstaat (2017–18).


== Politics ==
Mutluer became a member of the municipal council of Zaanstad after she was elected in the 2006 election as the Labour Party's fifth candidate in the municipality. Mutluer was re-elected in March 2010, being placed second on the party list. She became her party's caucus leader in the municipal council in December 2010. She again appeared second on the Labour Party's list in the 2014 municipal election. Besides, Mutluer became a member of an advisory committee that selected the Labour Party's candidates for the 2017 general election. She stepped down as caucus leader for a half year starting in the spring of 2016 in order to write her dissertation.Mutluer was re-elected once again in March 2018 as her party's lead candidate. She vacated her seat in the municipal council in June to serve as alderwoman of housing, youth care services, poverty, and elderly policy in the new municipal executive. She also became a board member of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG) in late 2019. Zaanstad received €20.5 million from the national government during her term to invest in the quick construction of new houses and another €43 million to spend on vulnerable neighborhoods in the eastern part of the city, more than any other municipality. Mutluer told that she wanted to use the latter funds to increase the sustainability of 850 houses, to improve public spaces and amenities, and to combat housing fraud. Halfway through 2020, a number of youth care service centers stopped admitting new children, as the region Zaanstreek-Waterland had run out of its budget for that year. The regional audit office concluded that the costs Zaanstad was making had gotten out of hand in the preceding years and that the municipality did not have reliable data about its system. Mutluer called on the national government to provide more funds to municipalities for youth care services.She was the Labour Party's tenth candidate in the March 2021 general election and received 4,896 preference votes. Mutluer was not elected, as her party won nine seats in the House of Representatives.

Mutluer was eventually appointed to the House of Representatives on 17 February 2022 following the resignation of Gijs van Dijk due to inappropriate behavior, and she simultaneously stepped down as alderwoman and board member of the VNG. She served as her party's spokesperson for security, justice, neighborhoods, discrimination, racism, and emancipation. A motion by Mutluer was carried stating that also insured inhabitants of Limburg and North Brabant with damage from the 2021 European floods should receive compensation from the government. A number of victims had received payments from their insurance company insufficient to repair all the damage and had because of that not qualified for government compensation. In 2023, Mutluer and Anne Kuik (CDA) introduced a bill to prohibit publishing videos of violent crime, following a number of filmed assaults that had gone viral online. The offense would carry a maximum fine of €9,000 or a one-year prison sentence, and the bill contained an exclusion for footage published in the public interest. Mutluer said these videos infringe on the human dignity of crime victims.In March 2022, Mutluer was the Labour Party's lijstduwer in Zaanstad in the municipal election. She had also been pursuing a second term as alderwoman before her appointment to the House.

Newspaper NRC reported in February 2023 that some members of the committee had demanded the departure of fellow members Pepijn van Houwelingen (FVD) Wybren van Haga (BVNL) for promoting prejudiced views. The following week, Paul – who did not have the authority to remove members – announced that the committee would continue its work following constructive talks.

Paulusma has two younger brothers. She attended the secondary school Hondrus College in Emmen at vwo level and subsequently studied at the School of Nursing, part of the Groningen Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

== Politics ==


=== Local (2014–2021) ===
She was inspired to go into politics by Els Borst, D66 leader and Ministers of Health, Welfare, and Sport, and joined D66 in 2012. Paulusma was elected to the Groningen municipal council in the 2014 municipal elections as D66's eighth candidate. She had decided to run for office because municipalities had been given more health care responsibilities, and she therefore deemed it necessary for people with experience in that field to be in the municipal council. Paulusma was one of the organizers of a G1000 conference, which was held in Groningen in June 2015. The conference about the city's future was attended by over 500 citizens, who had been chosen through a lottery, and it followed the concept of other G1000 conferences that had been held in Belgium and the Netherlands. Paulusma was also one of the initiators of a cooperative district council with members chosen through a lottery in her own district, the Oosterparkwijk. She had been inspired by a similar council in the London Borough of Lambeth. In the municipal council, she proposed making it possible for citizens to retrieve the municipality's file of them online. She also advocated banning smoking in places such as playgrounds and schools.Paulusma was re-elected in November 2018 as D66's second candidate. Her new specialties in the council included health care, welfare, local democracy, safety, and diversity. She also helped organize the campaign Raad zoekt Vrouw (Council is looking for women) to get more women elected to the Groningen council, for which she received the 2017 inspiration award from D66's Els Borst Netwerk. Paulusma also won the European Innovation in Politics Award for Democracy in 2019 for her work on the cooperative district council. She left the municipal council in April 2021 after her election to the House of Representatives.While a councilor, Paulusma served as chair of D66's national thematic department Care and Welfare, as a board member of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG; 2016–2021), and as a board member of the Els Borst Netwerk, which promotes gender equality within D66.


=== House of Representatives ===
She ran for member of parliament in the 2021 general election, being placed fifteenth on D66's party list. Paulusma was elected and received 14,933 preference votes. She tested positive for the coronavirus on 30 March, causing her to miss the swearing in of the new House of Representatives the following day. Paulusma was eventually installed on 15 April. Paulusma became her party's spokesperson for curative care, mental health care, assisted living for people with psychological and psychosocial issues, caregivers, medicine, and war victims, and she is a member of the Committees for Health, Welfare and Sport and for Kingdom Relations (vice chair and later chair).In the House, she drew attention to long COVID, a condition from which she was suffering as a result of her coronavirus infection, and offered an action plan to Minister for Medical Care Tamara van Ark. Following the swearing in of the fourth Rutte cabinet in January 2022, her specialties changed to the coronavirus, curative care, and medicine. She defended her party's position to keep open the option of instating a 2G policy, under which only vaccinated or recovered people are allowed to enter certain places, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Paulusma complained about the hatred, sexism, and accusations she was experiencing since taking on the COVID-19 portfolio, and months later a man was sentenced to one month in prison after making threats against her as well as an acting mayor and two police officers. When the health minister was considering closing two of the four locations in the Netherlands for pediatric heart surgery for the sake of centralization, Paulusma filed a motion in February 2022 to force the investigation to take regional spread into account. It was supported by a majority of the House. Another motion of Paulusma was carried to send free self-tests to women to detect the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cervical cancer. This was in response to decreasing turn-out during screenings for the virus. The self-tests had earlier only been available upon request.Following her November 2023 re-election, Paulusma's portfolio changed to curative care, medical ethics, emancipation, and sport.


== Personal life ==
Paulusma lives in the city of Groningen. She has a husband, and they have a son and a daughter.

75,"Elisabeth Maria Josepha ""Lilianne"" Ploumen  (Dutch pronunciation: [eːˈlisaːbɛt maːˈrijaː joːˈseːfaː liliˈɑnə ˈplumə(n)]; born 12 July 1962) is a Dutch politician and activist who served as Leader of the Labour Party from January 2021 until April 2022. She had been a member of the House of Representatives since 2017, as well as parliamentary leader since 2021, leaving the House of Representatives upon her resignation as party leader. Ploumen previously served as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation from 2012 to 2017.


== Early life and career ==
Ploumen was born in Maastricht on 12 July 1962.In 1983, while still at university, Ploumen became a community outreach worker in the Crooswijk area of Rotterdam. Two years later she joined the Institute of Psychological Market Research (IPM), a research-based consultancy, working in the statistics department as a research project leader. From 1990 to 1992 she was a marketing and research manager for Foster Parents Plan in Amsterdam. Ploumen then moved to Plan, the London-based umbrella organization, in 1993. In 1995 she founded Ploumen Projecten, an organization specializing in market research and innovation for commercial and non-profit clients.Ploumen was director of Mama Cash and worked for Cordaid as head of quality and strategy and subsequently as director of international programmes.


== Political career ==
Ploumen became a member of the Labour Party in 2003.She was the chairwoman of the Labour Party from 6 October 2007, after she beat former Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment Jan Pronk with 54% of the vote. She resigned from this post on 22 January 2012 and was succeeded by Hans Spekman.Ploumen served as Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in the second Rutte cabinet from 5 November 2012 until 2017.Early on in her tenure, Ploumen and Secretary of State of Finance Frans Weekers submitted a proposal in 2013 to renegotiate the Netherlands’ tax treaties with 23 least-developed countries. Their move was widely seen as marking a turning point for a country that long deflected accusations that it is a key player in tax avoidance by multinational corporations. With their proposal, Ploumen and Weekers followed the recommendations of a government-commissioned report which, for the first time, agreed with tax-justice groups that developing countries miss out on substantial tax revenues because of their treaties with the Netherlands.During her time in office, Ploumen increased the Netherlands' support to the GAVI vaccination alliance, from €200 million to €250 million for period from 2016 until 2020. Between 2014 and 2016, she co-chaired the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-Operation (alongside José Antonio Meade Kuribreña). She also served a two-year term as member of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Advisory Council on Gender and Development from 2015 until 2017.In January 2016, Ploumen headed an official Dutch delegation to Cuba, including some 60 businesses. During the trip, it was announced that global consumer products company Unilever would return to Cuba after a several-year absence, agreeing to build a $35 million soap and toothpaste factory in Cuba’s special development zone at the port of Mariel west of Havana.Most notably, however, Ploumen started the ""She Decides"" campaign, an initiative of about 50 countries, organizations and foundations to finance global family planning initiatives after a U.S. halt to such programs left NGOs worldwide with a large funding gap. Within six months the organization received pledges worth US$300 million. As minister, she pledged 10 million euro to counter the Mexico City policy.Following the 2014 European elections, international news media widely considered Ploumen one of the candidates for the nomination to become the Netherlands’ member of the European Commission; the post eventually went to Frans Timmermans.In the Dutch elections in 2017, in which the PvdA won nine seats, Ploumen was tenth on the electoral list, but due to preferential votes still won a seat in the Dutch House of Representatives.On 12 April 2022, Ploumen resigned as both leader of the Labour Party and as member of the Dutch House of Representatives. In a statement explaining her decision, she stated to ""not feel at home"" in her role as party leader.

When then-governor Frits Goedgedrag resigned for health reasons, Van der Pluijm-Vrede remained as acting governor until a new governor was sworn in on 4 November 2013


== Political career ==
From 2002 to 2010 Van der Pluijm-Vrede served as Acting Governor of the Netherlands Antilles, with Frits Goedgedrag being governor. following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antillesin 2010, Van der Pluijm-Vrede was sworn in as acting Governor of Curaçao.
In December 2010, Helmin Wiels, leader of Pueblo Soberano in the Estates of Curaçao called for the resignation of Van der Pluijm-Vrede. According to Wiels, Van der Pluijm-Vrede violated her oath of office.On 2 January 2013, Van der Pluijm-Vrede swore in the technocrat cabinet of Daniel Hodge, and honorably dismissed the previous interim-cabinet led by Stanley Betrian. The Hodge cabinet was formed as another interim cabinet, this time to handle reforms after the 2012 elections which failed to produce a coalition ready to reform. On 27 March 2013 the Hodge cabinet resigned after there were indications that political parties in Curaçao would be able to form a political cabinet. The Hodge cabinet took caretaker-status. On 5 May 2013, Helmin Wiels, who was involved in the process of cabinet formation, was killed. On 27 May 2013, Van der Pluijm-Vrede was asked by the then coalition of PS, PAIS, PNP and independent member Glenn Sulvaran to install a political cabinet on 3 June 2013. Member of Parliament for PS, Ivar Asjes, resigned his seat to become the new Prime Minister of Curaçao. Formateur Glenn Camelia, who had been appointed previously, handed in his final report to Van der Pluijm-Vrede the same day. The final report contained information regarding the formation and proposed cabinet ministers. Asjes withdrew his resignation from Parliament a few days later, after having received a letter by Van der Pluijm-Vrede which said that the screening on integrity of the new ministers was not yet completed. She said that as a consequence it would not be possible to install the new government on 3 June. On 7 June 2013 Van der Pluijm-Vrede installed the new government under Ivar Asjes.On 30 April 2013, Van der Pluijm-Vrede was present at the abdication of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. She signed the Act of Abdication (Dutch: Akte van Abdicatie) as a witness for the delegation of Curaçao. On 25 June 2013 she swore in her deputy, N.C. Römer-Kenepa, at Fort Amsterdam.On 4 November 2013 Lucille George-Wout was sworn in by King Willem-Alexander as the new Governor of Curaçao. Van der Pluijm-Vrede resigned as Acting Governor of Curaçao on 1 April 2014. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau for her work as Acting Governor.


== Other career ==
Aside from her former position as acting governor, Van der Pluijm-Vrede is a notary. She has her own notary office since 1994.


== Legal issues ==
In October 2011 Van der Pluijm-Vrede was summoned by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. She was summoned after Barney Ivanovic filed charges against her concerning forgery and perverting the course of justice. Ivanovic claimed that on 1 March 2008 he was forced out of the Plaza Hotel in Willemstad, which he claims was his own after he bought it from the Van der Valk hotel chain. He was supposedly threatened under gunpoint by George Jamaloodin, who at the time of the incident was owner of Speedy Security, but at the time of the charges was Minister of Finance of Curaçao. Ivanovic' charges related to the ownership of the building, which Van der Pluijm-Vrede supposedly incorrectly handled. Ivanovic said that at some times he did not know whether he was dealing with a notary or with the acting governor. Van der Pluijm-Vrede refused to go to the court, citing costs and her work as notary and acting governor general. She asked the court to drop the charges. On 9 November 2011 the claims filed by Ivanovic regarding Van der Pluijm-Vrede were dismissed. The presiding judge cited lack of personal jurisdiction as the case concerned foreign nationals and companies, having no relation with Florida. The judge also cited failure to state a claim by Ivanovic. On 20 August 2013 Van der Pluijm-Vrede was heard as witness by the Joint Court of Justice on Curaçao in her capacity as notary concerning the same case.

She had previously been a member of the Utrecht municipal council starting in 2014, and she has worked as an aid worker and as an independent adviser for municipalities.


== Early life and career ==
Podt was born and raised in the South Holland town of Papendrecht and lived in its Molenwijk neighborhood. Her father was the manager of a factory of plastic products that her grandfather had founded. Podt attended the secondary school De Lage Waard and graduated in 1994 with an atheneum diploma. She subsequently studied industrial design engineering at Delft University of Technology for eight years, including one year as a full-time board member of a student association, and did an internship in Nicaragua. During the last three years of her study, Podt worked as a partner and trainer for a company called PinguinXL.After graduating, she became a project manager at the traffic innovation department of CBR, which is responsible for driving licenses in the Netherlands. She then took a job in 2005 at the non-profit International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) as a monitoring and evaluation expert and filled that position for five years. For the last three of those years, she also served as an ICT and democratization coordinator for the organization's Ecuador operations. Podt became the IICD's Kenya country manager in 2011. She left the foundation in 2014 to work as a freelance social adviser for municipalities under the name A Single Step.While a freelancer, she held positions as an advisory board member of Utrecht University's Incluusion refugee program (2016) and as chair of the supervisory board of ActionAid Netherlands (2018–21).


== Politics ==
Podt ran for the Utrecht municipal council in 2014 and was elected as D66's seventh candidate. She had previously chaired D66's International Affairs/International Cooperation thematic department in the years 2010–12. In the council, Podt's specialties were youth, welfare, public health, diversity, social shelters, and addiction treatment. In 2016, she proposed a pilot to immediately give a house to 200 news refugees who have yet to receive a residence permit and to start their integration process. The plan did not receive enough support from the council. She also successfully pled for unisex toilets in municipal buildings in 2016 to make them more attractive for transgender people, making Utrecht the first municipality in the Netherlands to have them in its city hall. Podt was re-elected in 2018, being placed second on D66's party list, and became her party's vice caucus chair. Her specialties changed to work, income, LGBTI, refugees, integration, social shelters, and addiction treatment.Podt participated in the March 2021 general election as D66's 26th candidate. She received 3,919 preference votes and was not elected, as her party won 24 seats. Following the resignation of D66 member of parliament Steven van Weyenberg, Podt was sworn into the House of Representatives on 7 September 2021. Van Weyenberg had stepped down due to his new cabinet position. Podt left the Utrecht municipal council and serves in the House as D66's spokesperson for refugees, migration, the Participation Act, migrant workers, labor conditions, integration, sex work, and human trafficking. She is on the Committees for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (vice chair); for Education, Culture and Science; for Finance; for Justice and Security; and for Social Affairs and Employment. In the House, Podt advocated allowing migrant workers into the Netherlands to mitigate personnel shortages. She also wrote a policy proposal to mostly remove labor restrictions for asylum seekers. These limited migrants from being employed within half a year of their arrival and from working more than 24 weeks per year afterwards. Under Podt's proposal, asylum seekers would have to wait only one month after their arrival to apply for jobs, and the yearly limit would be removed. A judge later called the labor restrictions unlawful, but the cabinet appealed the decision. During a debate on Podt's proposal in May 2023, Minister for Migration Eric van der Burg (VVD) opposed the plans, saying there are more pressing issues related to an increased migrant influx to focus on.She was re-elected in November 2023, and her portfolio changed to migration, defense, labor, purchasing power, sex work, and human trafficking.

Podt has been living in the city of Utrecht since the second half of the 2000s. She has a boyfriend and a daughter.

She has served as a member of the House of Representatives from 2021 to 2023, initially as the temporary replacement of Rens Raemakers but later as the successor of Rob Jetten. Sahla's involvement in her local community led her to become politically active. She was elected to The Hague's municipal council in 2018 and participated in the March 2021 general election but was not directly elected.

She joined the parent council of primary school Het Galjoen around 2008 as well as the council of the umbrella organization consisting of about 50 schools. She sent a critical letter to Ingrid van Engelshoven, The Hague's alderwoman for education and a D66 member, in 2013, and this contact resulted in Sahla deciding to become politically active.

She then moved back to Rotterdam, where she worked for a shipping firm and then for the Stichting Samenwerkende Kerken. From 1958 to 1974, Schmitz worked for educational organisations in Rotterdam. At the same time, she studied administrative law and political science at Erasmus University, studying at the evenings and on weekends.


== Political career ==
Schmitz first became involved in politics in 1968, when she joined the Democrats 66 (D66). From 1972 to 1974, Schmitz was a member of the Rotterdam City Council. She served first as a member of the D66 and then, in 1974, joined the Labour Party (PvdA). She became an alderman for social affairs on behalf of that party, serving between 1974 and 1982. She opposed cuts to social services and following fraud in the department, she appointed Ien Dales to take over as the social services director. While serving in these positions, the two women became close.Schmitz was elected as the mayor of Haarlem between 16 February 1985 and 3 August 1994. During this period, she had a relationship with Dales, then mayor of Nijmegen. She succeeded Jos van Kemenade as vice president of Pax Christi in 1986. She remained in this position until she joined the cabinet in 1994.Schmitz was appointed as the Secretary of State for Justice by Wim Kok on 22 August 1994, serving in the Kok I cabinet. She was responsible for immigration and asylum policy, family law, youth advocacy, gambling, legal aid and nationality. She held this position until 3 August 1998. During her tenure as state secretary, asylum policy was a hot topic across Europe. Schmitz made an effort to deport illegal immigrants from the Netherlands. The most famous of them was Amsterdam tailor Gümüş, who had to return to Turkey with his family after living and working in the Netherlands for many years. While in this position, she proposed legislation to pardon illegal immigrants who had been living in the country for six years, but this was blocked by the D66 and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VDD).Schmitz was a deputy judge in the district court in Zwolle between 1999 and 2008 and a deputy judge in the district court in Zutphen between 2004 and 2008. She was a member of the Advisory Council on International Affairs between 2001 and January 2006 and a chair of the Advisory Board Members Selection Committee Judiciary from 2005.After four years as secretary of state, she left politics in August 1998. From 1999 to 2009, Schmitz chaired the curatorium of the African Studies Centre in Leiden. On 1 February 2000, she succeeded Til Gardeniers-Berendsen as the health insurance ombudsman, a position she held until 2010.


== Personal life ==
Schmitz was Roman Catholic and in 1970, she was offered a position as assistant secretary of the diocese of Rotterdam, but she rejected the offer due to her conflict with the bishop of the diocese, Adrianus Johannes Simonis. In 2016, an exhibit at the Museum Haarlem honoured the former mayors of the city, including Schmitz, Bernt Schneiders, Jaap Pop and Jan Reehorst.

95,"Silvana Hildegard ""Sylvana"" Simons (Dutch pronunciation: [sɪlˈvaːnaː ˈsimɔns]; born 31 January 1971) is a Surinamese-born Dutch politician and former television presenter. She has served as a member of the House of Representatives since 2021 on behalf of BIJ1, an egalitarian anti-racist party founded by Simons in 2016.
She was born in Suriname and moved to the Netherlands while an infant. She was a dancer in the Amsterdam nightlife scene before becoming a VJ for the new music channel TMF in 1995. Simons left four years later to join SBS Broadcasting, where she presented reality television series De bus (2000). She subsequently spent almost a decade at RTL Nederland, hosting the first few seasons of TV makelaar (2001–05) about home buying and the Saturday evening show Dancing with the Stars (2005–07). Starting in 2009, Simons worked some years in public broadcasting as a radio presenter on Radio 6 and for the association NPS.
She transitioned to politics in 2016, when she joined minority rights party DENK. Her career change followed her questioning of a term which she deemed racially insensitive during talk show De wereld draait door the previous year. Her speaking out against institutional racism – and especially Sinterklaas's blackfaced companion Zwarte Piet – caused fierce criticism on social media platforms and racist remarks and threats. Simons left DENK after seven months to establish her own political party called Artikel 1, which was later renamed BIJ1. She did not win a seat in the 2017 general election, but she was elected to the Amsterdam municipal council the following year. Simons became the first black parliamentary leader in Dutch history following her election to the House of Representatives in 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Simons was born on 31 January 1971 in the Surinamese capital of Paramaribo to Wilfred Hugo Leeuwin (born 1928) and Roline Yvonne Kerk (born 1945). She was raised without her siblings even though her father and her mother had fifteen children and one child, respectively, from previous relationships. The family came to the Netherlands when Simons was aged one and a half and lived in the Amsterdam neighborhoods Kinkerbuurt and Osdorp. She moved to the North Holland city of Hoorn another ten years later, growing up in its neighborhood Grote Waal. Her father worked as a bookkeeper for an insurance company, while her mother was employed by IBM. In her childhood, Simons rode horses and danced. She had started dancing lessons at the age of seven and later did preparatory training in Amsterdam for the ballet academy, dreaming of becoming the first black soloist of the Dutch National Ballet. She went to the secondary school RSG West-Friesland, initially studying at vwo level, but she later switched to havo.At the age of fourteen, Simons moved out of her parents's house after her father had told her to leave if she did not want to abide by his rules. At first, she stayed at her half-sister in Amsterdam, but she later spent time in a youth shelter and in lodgings with assistance. During that period, she attended the Amsterdams Lyceum and the Spinoza Lyceum, among others, but never graduated. Simons also went to the Lucias Marthas Institute For Performing Arts and the Hairdressing Academy, finishing neither school. When she was twenty years old, she was admitted to the show and musical department of the Amsterdam University of the Arts, but she dropped out shortly after the start of the program because of her first pregnancy.


== Entertainment career ==


=== Dancing and early television career (1989–2000) ===
Simons began her career in 1989 as a dancer for the Amsterdam nightclub iT and during performances of musicians such as CB Milton and Grace Jones. She went on tour with 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor and performed as backing for UB40 at the World Liberty Concert in Arnhem. Simons also appeared in commercials for Pepsi, Philips, and Victoria Vesta. She did a screen test for radio and television executive Lex Harding in 1992 after he had seen her dance in the Veronica music program Countdown. Harding asked her a few years later to join the new musical channel TMF. Simons accepted and started as VJ and interviewer at its launch in May 1995. She later gave up dancing to focus on her television career. On TMF, Simons presented the show Sylvana's Soul, which helped popularize R&B in the Netherlands and earned her the nickname ""Dutch Queen of R&B"". She also recorded the single ""Get Close To You"" with fellow VJs Fabienne de Vries, Bridget Maasland, and Isabelle Brinkman as part of the music group The Magnificent Four. It reached position sixteen in the Dutch Top 40 and spent five weeks in that chart, but Simons has told that she was unable to sing and was mostly responsible for backing vocals. She became a board member of Mixt, a foundation attempting to combat racism through music and the organizer of the annual pop festival Racism Beat It, in early 1999.Simons left TMF in 1999 and joined SBS Broadcasting later that year, presenting Sexquiz on the beach, a new weekly couples quiz involving stripping candidates, starting in September. She also hosted the program Politie door 't lint (Police snapping) and the first season of reality competition De bus, which was similar to Big Brother and which took place in a bus. Next to her job at SBS, Simons presented a radio show on Radio 538, and she wrote columns for the Dutch edition of Playboy and for the short-lived More! Magazine. The latter was launched by TMF in May 1999 with an issue featuring Simons and two of her colleagues naked on the cover.


=== RTL Nederland (2000–09) ===
She abandoned SBS Broadcasting in favor of RTL Nederland – then called Holland Media Group – and replaced Beau van Erven Dorens as host of the afternoon news magazine RTL Live in September 2000. The show was anchored by Minoesch Jorissen on Mondays and Tuesdays and by Simons on Wednesdays and Thursdays. RTL Live was canceled in May of the following year as a result of dwindling ratings. In the meantime, Simons had also moved her column from Playboy to Veronica Magazine, where it would remain until 2002, and had left her radio show at Radio 538 to work for Noordzee FM in March 2001. She had two shows on that station, Sylvana and Sylvana's Soul, which were broadcast on Friday and Saturday evenings, respectively.Simons started presenting her second show for RTL Nederland in November 2001, when TV makelaar (TV real estate agent) debuted. She was the sole host of the program, in which she assisted people in their search for a new home. It was renewed for several new seasons. At the same time, she co-presented the Monday evening show Met man en macht (With all his power), in which she and two other women interviewed male guests, in early 2002 and the program Je echte leeftijd (Your real age) with John Williams starting in May 2003. In the latter show, participants performed a RealAge test to find out how healthily they had been living. Simons also became the sole host of the book program Kaft (Cover), which first aired in April 2004. At TV makelaar, she was joined by Sybrand Niessen that same year. In 2005, she hosted the hidden camera show Bekend en bekeken (Famous and watched) and the quiz show De aanhouder wint (Slow and steady wins the race), based on the British Perseverance.When television franchise Dancing with the Stars was brought to the Netherlands, Simons and Ron Brandsteder became the hosts. It debuted in August 2005. The first season finale was watched by 2.7 million people, and the show was nominated for a Golden Televizier Ring. It had been announced shortly before the first airing of Dancing with the Stars that Simons would be replaced by Marilou le Grand as host of TV makelaar. Besides, she became an ambassador of development aid agency Simavi around that time. She had already been in the same role at Stichting Pink Ribbon, which raises awareness of breast cancer, since 2004. Simons co-hosted the second season of Dancing with the Stars in the first half of 2006. She also presented three reality television shows later that year: Inpakken en wegdromen (Pack up and dream away), in which people went on their dream holiday; Opvolger gezocht (Successor wanted), in which she helped family business owners find their successor; and Hoe mooi is jouw straat? (How pretty is your street?), in which residents gave their street a makeover. Opvolger gezocht was canceled after three episodes due to low ratings. Simons presented a third season of Dancing with the Stars in early 2007 as well as the new RTL 5 reality show Ex Wives Club along with two other hosts. In December, she replaced Chazia Mourali as the presenter of Char, a show with American self-proclaimed psychic medium Char Margolis. Simons's last episode of Dancing with the Stars, a special to promote Plan International, aired days later.It was reported in January 2008 that RTL Nederland had ended Simons's contract. Several new presenters had recently become part of the media network following the disbandment of TV channel Tien. She did continue hosting Char, and she co-hosted the daily RTL 4 program Nederland vertrekt (The Netherlands leaves) with a dozen other presenters in the summer of 2008 about people going on their holiday.


=== Radio 6 and other activities (2009–2015) ===
Simons started working for public broadcasting in 2009. She was given her own two-hour radio show in July called Sylvana's Choice, which aired on jazz station Radio 6 on weekdays, and she returned to television in September with a music-related TV show for NPS with the same name on Sunday afternoons on Nederland 2. Simons also started hosting the Saturday late evening talk show Sylvana in April 2010 on Nederland 1. Besides, she co-presented live television and radio coverage of the North Sea Jazz Festival, and she presented De zwarte lijst (The black list) about black music annually. News broadcaster NOS described her as the face of Radio 6. Sylvana's Choice was canceled in 2010, but she later received a Tuesday evening slot for a show called Soul & Jazz. She permanently left Radio 6 at the start of 2014, while remaining the host of North Sea Jazz Festival coverage and De zwarte lijst on television.Next to her work for Radio 6, Simons started appearing as a recurring sidekick on talk show De wereld draait door in 2012, and she participated in the celebrity dancing contest Strictly Come Dancing, part of the same franchise as Dancing with the Stars. She was coupled with professional dancer Redmond Valk, who was later replaced by Aerjen Mooijweer because of an injury, and they were the season's runners-up. In late 2012, Simons presented the three-episode music series Puro 43 Music Sessions on RTL 8. She later also worked as a public speaking and personal leadership coach as co-owner of The House of Power. Simons participated in the theater tour LULverhalen (Dick stories), in which women talked about an either literal or figurative dick, in 2015. She was uninvited after she had talked about her opposition to Zwarte Piet – Sinterklaas's companion with blackface – during her first performance, causing some audience members to walk out of the performance.


== Political career ==


=== DENK (2016) ===
Simons has told that she decided to publicly speak out against institutional racism following a May 2015 incident and the reactions it had brought about, which included fierce criticism on social media: in an episode of De wereld draait door, presenter Martin Šimek used the word zwartjes (darkies) in a discussion about immigrants, causing Simons to question him on his usage of the word. The Algemeen Dagblad described 2015 as the year in which Simons had become the figurehead of the Dutch black community because of this event and her opposition to Zwarte Piet, whom she had protested at the national arrival of Sinterklaas in Meppel.
She joined the left-wing minority rights party DENK on 18 May 2016, and it was simultaneously announced that she would run for member of the House of Representatives in the 2017 general election. DENK had been founded the year before by Turkish-born Dutch politicians Tunahan Kuzu and Selçuk Öztürk after they had left the Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid, PvdA). Simons had been asked by Kuzu to join the party, and she also started serving as a communications advisor. Simons indicated an interest in anti-racism, decolonizing education, and empowering women.Her announcement caused an avalanche of negative reactions on social media platforms, some of which referred to her Surinamese heritage and have been characterized as sexist or racist. This last category includes a Facebook event, which received tens of thousands of reactions, to wave Simons goodbye on Saint Nicholas Day – a reference to her opposition to Zwarte Piet. Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Minister Lodewijk Asscher condemned the reactions, calling them ""disgusting"", and Simons filed a police report. DENK announced in November 2016 that Simons was receiving protection following a threat video on Dailymotion. It combined the carnival song Oh Sylvana, the lyrics of which ask her to leave the country, by Rob van Daal with a picture of lynched African Americans, whose faces had been replaced by the one of Simons. 22 people were prosecuted in April 2017 for threats and insults including the creator of the video, leading to at least twenty of them receiving fines of up to €450 and community-service orders of up to 80 hours. The Public Prosecution Service stated that it did not have the resources to investigate all 40,000 comments that were identified as possibly illegal.


=== Own party and 2017 general election ===
Simons left DENK on 24 December 2016 to establish a party of her own called Artikel 1 to participate in the 2017 general election. Simons told that she wanted to belong to a party where she felt safe. She criticized DENK for being more concerned with celebrating media attention than with Simons's well-being when she received protection. Besides, she called the party's tactics polarizing, although she praised its goal of putting racism on the political agenda. She also said that there was not enough space at DENK to stand up for women's and LGBT rights because of its conservative supporters. She founded her new party, which was named after the constitution's article addressing equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination, with DENK's campaign manager Ian van der Kooye. Following her departure, DENK demanded €62,000 in damages from Simons for violating her employment contract's confidentiality clause and notice period. A court determined that DENK instead owed €5,000 in wages to Simons, which she later declined.Ahead of the 2017 general election, Artikel 1 released its election program, in which it advocated single-payer healthcare, more female and immigrant cabinet members, a prohibition of Zwarte Piet in public spaces and on public television, an investigation into racial profiling, and a new national holiday to celebrate the abolition of slavery. Besides, the party pledged to strive for a world in which people could live and work wherever they want. Simons also co-wrote a book ahead of the election called Artikel 1: Een nieuwe politiek van gelijkwaardigheid (Article 1: A new politics of equality). Simons was the lead candidate of Artikel 1, and its party list contained more women than men, several people from the LGBT community, and both the youngest (18) and oldest (82) candidate of the election. The party received 0.27% of the vote in the March 2017 election – not enough for a seat in the House of Representatives.Artikel 1 changed its name to BIJ1 (Together) in October after a court had ruled in June that the original name was too similar to that of Art.1, a discrimination expertise center. The party reiterated its commitment to be ""against the current politics, which is full of hatred of Muslims, xenophobia, gender inequality, racism, socioeconomic exclusion, gender discrimination, division, exclusion, and exploitation"".


=== Amsterdam municipal council (2018–2020) ===
In March 2018, Simons participated in the municipal election in Amsterdam as her party's lead candidate. She campaigned on a platform of economic justice, radical equality, and the importance of intersectionality, and she told that she wanted Amsterdam to maintain its inclusivity. She also refused to participate in a debate after learning that she would have to debate Annabel Nanninga (FVD) one-on-one. BIJ1 won one out of 45 seats in the election and Simons was sworn into the municipal council on 29 March. Her party was most popular in Amsterdam-Zuidoost. A documentary by Ingeborg Jansen about her campaign called Sylvana, demon of diva (Sylvana, demon or diva) premiered in November 2018 at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam.
Following the killing of Michael Fudge by police officers in February 2019, Simons requested a debate about the incident, which was described as a suicide by cop by the media. She said there had been excessive and unnecessary police violence and told that teenagers of color lived in an understandable fear of the police. Councilor Nicole Temmink (SP) said it would have been better to await the results of an investigation by the Rijksrecherche and Simons's comments were denounced by the rest of the council as well as by Mayor Femke Halsema. Simons also introduced motions to stop the municipality from fining homeless people for sleeping in the streets and to provide white privilege training for civil servants. Both passed the council. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she opposed plans of the municipal executive to raise local taxes, which would compensate for financial setbacks.Newspaper Het Parool wrote that Simons was able to influence the council's agenda during her time in office despite having only one seat. According to the article, her party's competition with GroenLinks caused that party to focus more on identity politics in Amsterdam. Simons also played a role in getting the city to apologize for its history of slavery, in making the toilets of the Stopera unisex, and in getting the city to proclaim a climate crisis. She was awarded the Ribbius Peletier medal in 2021 by the province of North Holland for ""being an example to the next generation of women"" and for ""publicly speaking out against a combination of sexism and racism"".


=== 2021 general election and House of Representatives ===
In January 2020, BIJ1 signaled its intention to participate in the 2021 general election. Simons gave up her seat in the Amsterdam municipal council in early November to focus on the campaign. She called her party's platform the country's ""most leftist, greenest, and most inclusive"". It included a rise in the minimum wage to €14 per hour, the introduction of a Ministry of Equality, and ""taking control of the economy's most important industries"". She rejected capitalism, saying that it is based on the illusion of endless economic growth and that it leads to poverty, exploitation, and exclusion. According to Simons, an alternative economic system has to be designed and created with the participation of everyone. BIJ1 won one seat in the March 2021 general election causing Simons to be elected to the House of Representatives. She was sworn in on 31 March as the first black parliamentary leader in the House's history. Her election occurred amidst the anti-racism movement Black Lives Matter gaining traction following the murder of George Floyd in the United States by a police officer in May 2020.In the House, Simons focused on education, the interior, economic affairs, climate policy, social affairs, and kingdom relations, while cooperating on many issues with Caroline van der Plas (BBB) and Liane den Haan (independent) because of their positions as fellow one-person caucus leaders. In the House, Simons has criticized the cabinet's strategy to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that stricter measures such as longer and more stringent lockdowns were required to contain the virus. She filed a motion in July 2021 in which she argued that the cabinet's strategy of ""letting [the virus] run wild in a controlled way"" had led to 30,000 deaths. No other parties in the House supported her motion, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the accusation ""brazen and uncivilized"". Another motion by Simons, which called for an investigation into establishing a constitutional court in the Netherlands, was adopted by the House. Simons also described her family history of slavery when potential apologies for the Netherlands' history of slavery were discussed in a House debate in 2021. Mark Rutte cited the moment as one of the reasons that made him decide to issue an apology on behalf of the government the following year. Simons was less active in debates during the last period of her term due to her membership of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Fraud Policy and Public Service, initiated as a result of the Dutch childcare benefits scandal.On several occasions, the media reported on clashes between Simons and fellow politicians. Renske Leijten asked Simons in October 2021 whether she considered her to be a racist as a result of online comments directed at Leijten by BIJ1 members, and Ockje Tellegen rebuked Simons while chairing a legislative meeting a month later, when Simons wanted to address comments that she described as intimidating. House Speaker Vera Bergkamp later defended Tellegen's actions in a letter after Simons had filed a complaint. Following a 2022 riot in Staphorst against anti-Zwarte Piet protestors, Simons denounced the police's handling and asked Minister of Justice and Security Dilan Yeşilgöz why she resisted a broad investigation into racism in the police force. In turn, Yeşilgöz criticized Simons's description of police officers as using unwarranted violence against citizens.When the collapse of the fourth Rutte cabinet triggered a November 2023 snap election, Simons announced on 24 July that she would not run for re-election. Two BIJ1 Amsterdam councilors had left the party weeks earlier because of what they alleged to be a toxic and unsafe climate in the party. They mentioned Simons had not supported them enough – a characterization Simons vehemently denied. The party had seen several other internal struggles in the preceding years. Simons also cited her health and well-being reasons for her decision not to run. She was succeeded as party leader by Edson Olf, BIJ1's vice chair. For her work, Simons had received the Ally Award from queer lifestyle magazine Winq in 2022 and the Black Achievement Award from the organization of the Black Achievement Month in 2023.


== Personal life ==
Simons has two children. Her son, Salvatore, was born in 1992, when she was 21 years old. Simons has described the father and her then boyfriend as abusive and depressed. She has told that he stalked her after the end of their three-year relationship, and he died about a year after the birth of their child. According to Simons, the police reported an unknown cause of death, but she believes that it was a suicide. Her second child, Levi, was born in 1996, shortly before Simons's father died by suicide. From late 1998 to 1999, Simons lived in London with her British boxer boyfriend and two children while still working in the Netherlands. She moved to Duivendrecht, situated close to Amsterdam, in 2001 after having spent the intermittent time in Diemen.She married entrepreneur Frank van Hoorn in early 2003 in Costa Rica. Simons wrote a book about the household, consisting of herself, her husband, her two children, her husband's two teenage daughters, and an au pair, called 1+1=7. Another book by Simons and her half-brother Kenneth Leeuwin, a karate world champion, called In balans about the balance between physical and mental health was published a year later in 2005. Simons and her husband divorced in 2006, and she subsequently had a relationship with entrepreneur Roland Kahn, the founder of clothing retailer CoolCat, in the years 2009–12. She moved from Duivendrecht to Amsterdam, when she became a municipal councilor in 2018 to satisfy a residency requirement, but had moved back to the former village by the time she was installed as member of parliament in 2021.Simons is non-religious. She often reflects on her day and her actions through a conversation with herself in the mirror. Drawing is a hobby of hers. While a member of parliament, Simons disclosed that she had been suffering from chronic pain for ten years, possibly resulting from osteoarthritis, as well as from long COVID since March 2022.
