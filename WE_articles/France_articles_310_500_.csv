Appéré was elected to the National Assembly in the 2012 French legislative elections, representing Ille-et-Vilaine's 2nd constituency. She then became the first female mayor of Rennes in 2014 and was re-elected in 2020, when she also won the presidency of Rennes Métropole.


== Early life and education ==
Nathalie Appéré was born on 8 July 1975 in Ploemeur, Morbihan.Appéré moved to Rennes in 1993 after obtaining her baccalauréat. She enrolled in Sciences Po Rennes and graduated in 1996, writing a senior thesis titled ""Study for a Diagnostic and the Definition of a Research Strategy in the Rennes Agglomeration: Final Report Relating to the Study Contract with the City of Rennes–University of Rennes 1"" with Jacques Hardy as her advisor. Appéré then became a lecturer in public law.Appéré's professional career centred around city politics and urban social development. She first entered the public service as a research analyst for the Regional Institute of Social Work in Rennes from 1996 to 1998, after which she took up the post of director of public infrastructure for Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande from 2000 to 2008.


== Political career ==
After arriving in Rennes, Appéré joined the Young Socialist Movement at the age of 20 during the 1995 French presidential election. She became a member of the Socialist Party (PS) and took up several departmental posts within the party, notably that of spokesperson for the Socialist federation of Ille-et-Vilaine.Appéré joined Edmond Hervé's electoral list for Rennes in the 2001 municipal elections, after which she was appointed deputy mayor for community living. It was in this position that she led major city projects such as the reform of the Rennes Social and Cultural Office.


=== Rise to prominence ===
Appéré was the director of Daniel Delaveau's successful campaign for mayor of Rennes in the 2008 municipal elections, after which she was appointed first deputy mayor, in charge of Solidarity, and vice-president of Rennes Métropole, in charge of Social Cohesion. Among her initiatives were the implementation of the ""Sortir"" tourism card, providing discounts for visitors to cultural and entertainment attractions in Rennes, as well as the rehabilitation of the city's heritage district.Appéré also served as the president of the supervisory board of Guillaume-Régnier hospital from 2010 to 2012. In early 2012, she supported a strike at the hospital protesting the facility's insufficient patient capacity.At the national level, Appéré was named vice-president of the National Council of Cities in 2010. The body is presided over by the Prime Minister of France and discusses issues surrounding municipal politics, neighbourhood public policy and territorial difficulties.Appéré endorsed François Hollande in the PS' 2011 open presidential primary.


=== Member of the National Assembly ===
During the 2002 French legislative elections, Appéré was elected as the designated substitute of Philippe Tourtelier, Socialist deputy for Ille-et-Vilaine's 2nd constituency. After Tourtelier announced that he would not run for a third term in the 2012 legislative elections, Appéré was nominated by the PS in his riding. Speaking after receiving the nomination, she promised party activists that she would resign her executive offices in Rennes but also signalled that she would continue to sit on the city's municipal council. Appéré was elected to the National Assembly on 17 June 2012, winning 63.45% of the vote in the second round against Bertrand Plouvier of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).In December 2012, she declared her candidacy for the Socialist nomination for mayor of Rennes in the 2014 French municipal elections. Although Appéré had previously stated her opposition to the law on the accumulation of electoral mandates several times, she ultimately announced that she would serve out her full term as deputy if she were to be elected to the mayoralty.


=== Mayor of Rennes ===


==== First term ====
Appéré was elected mayor of Rennes on 4 April 2014 with 55.83% of the vote in the second round after forming an alliance with the Europe Ecology – The Greens–Left Front electoral list. She thus became the city's first female mayor.The beginning of Appéré's term was marked by several violent protests against the Grand Ouest Airport project in January 2016 as well as the El Khomri law between March and May of the same year. She responded by demanding a ""clear decision from the French state"" on the airport. Further riots broke out after the announcement of the El Khomri law, with a 20-year-old student notably losing an eye in the violence on 28 April. This led student protesters to interrupt a session of the Rennes municipal council on 2 May, calling for the mayor to put an end to police brutality.In 2016, Appéré endorsed Manuel Valls in the 2017 Socialist presidential primary and joined his campaign's organizational staff. Valls was defeated in the primary by Benoît Hamon, whom Appéré subsequently endorsed in the presidential election.In accordance with the law on the accumulation of electoral mandates, Appéré did not seek re-election in the 2017 French legislative elections. In 2018, she supported Olivier Faure for first secretary of the PS during its Aubervilliers Congress. Appéré was appointed to the party's national bureau on 15 April of that year.On 12 February 2019, the City Mayors Foundation awarded Appéré a World Mayor Commendation, along with Mayor Ros Jones of Doncaster, Mayor Charlotte Britz of Saarbrücken and Mayor Beng Climaco of Zamboanga City. The foundation announced that she had received the distinction for her housing policies, establishment of a participatory budget system and overseeing of demographic and economic development.Appéré's first term also saw the opening of the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire high-speed railway in July 2017, the Convent of the Jacobins Convention Centre in January 2018 and the renovated Rennes station in July 2019. Other infrastructure projects included two new public parks—the Saint-Martin Meadows and Baud Beaches.


==== 2020 Rennes municipal election campaign ====


===== Pre-election manoeuvres =====
On 26 June 2019, Appéré launched a discussion platform named ""200 Days for Rennes"" in the lead-up to the 2020 French municipal elections. The platform had a website with the address ""avecnathalieappere.fr"" (""With Nathalie Appéré""). In an interview with Ouest-France on 13 September, she confirmed that she would be a candidate in the upcoming municipal elections but would begin her campaign later than her competitors, citing her ongoing consideration of whether to run for the presidency of Rennes Métropole following the expected retirement of Socialist incumbent Emmanuel Couet. She received the endorsement of deputy François André, an independent affiliated with the La République En Marche group, four days later. Nevertheless, La République En Marche itself announced that it would be running its own electoral list in the elections.


===== Campaign and policy platform =====
Appéré announced her candidacy for the mayoralty of Rennes and the presidency of Rennes Métropole on 10 December 2019, during an 800-person event at Rennes' Le Liberté performance hall concluding the 200 Days for Rennes campaign. The latter ended after collecting the views of 1 000 Rennais, according to its organizers. Appéré was joined by representatives from the French Communist Party, the Radical Party of the Left, Génération.s and Place Publique who declared their parties' support for her campaign. The event also saw her announce the first planks of her platform, such as the creation of five rapid transit bus lines, which she called ""trambuses,"" the laying out of 100 kilometres of safe bicycle lanes, the adoption of free public transit for riders under 12 years old, the planting of 30 000 trees in six years, the uncovering of the Vilaine river in front of the Palace of Commerce as well as the establishment of a nighttime municipal police department and a police brigade combating anti-social behaviour.The following month, Appéré had the City of Rennes acquire the Jacques Cartier Prison with plans of converting it into a cultural attraction. She also announced the construction of an aquatic centre that would replace a public pool in the neighbourhood of Villejean. Appéré released her full platform on 7 February 2020, which included commitments to create citizens' panels for urban redevelopment projects and the redefinition of certain municipal policies, build a ""Neighbourhood of Creation"" for ""cultural and creative industries"" next to the city's SNCF station and never increase local taxes. On 21 February, she confirmed her candidacy for president of Rennes Métropole and joined 25 other electoral list leaders and 12 incumbent mayors in unveiling a metropolitan platform.On 5 March, Appéré held a rally in advance of the first round of the elections that attracted 800 people. The following day, she received the public endorsement of former mayor Edmond Hervé, under whom she had served as deputy mayor from 2001 to 2008.


===== Re-election victory =====
The first round of the election on 15 March 2020 was marked by the rapidly worsening COVID-19 pandemic. Appéré's list won 32.77% of the vote, putting it in first place ahead of the lists of Matthieu Theurier and Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), Carole Gandon and La République En Marche (LREM) and Charles Compagnon and the Miscellaneous right (DVG). Due to the COVID-19 lockdown in France, the second round was postponed to 28 June. It was during this delay that Appéré announced on 30 May that she had successfully concluded an electoral pact with the EELV to unite their lists in the second round against those of Gandon and Compagnon.Appéré's list won the second round with 65.35% of the vote, though voter turnout fell to a historic low of 68.33% of the electorate. Consequently, her result was ten percentage points higher than in 2014 but consisted of almost 9 000 fewer votes. She also finished far ahead of Gandon and Compagnon's lists, which recorded 17.49% and 17.15% of the vote respectively. Responding to the results, Appéré praised the ""clear, definite and massive choice of Rennais"" and welcomed the ""large victory with pride and emotion,"" while also promising to ""work to reinforce local democracy"" to remedy low voter turnout. She additionally described Rennes as ""the vanguard of a social and environmentalist left.""


==== Second term ====
During the first session of the new municipal council on 3 July, Appéré was re-elected mayor with 51 votes against 10 blank votes and one invalid vote for Hervé cast by an opposition councillor. Speaking after assuming office, Appéré spoke of the great ""emotion [she was feeling] at this moment"" and paid homage to her predecessors. She then appointed 21 deputy mayors, including 12 candidates from her municipal election list and nine from Theurier's EELV list. Several of the latter received important portfolios like Education, Culture and Finance. Also among the nominees was the son of Edmond Hervé, Marc Hervé, whom Appéré promoted from seventh deputy mayor, in charge of Finance, to first deputy mayor, in charge of Urban Planning.


=== President of Rennes Métropole ===
Appéré stood for the presidency of Rennes Métropole during the inaugural session of its communal council on 9 July 2020. She was the sole candidate and was elected with 78 votes out of 111 councillors present. This was followed by the new president's nomination of an executive cabinet consisting of 20 vice-presidents, 12 of which were not from Rennes (one more than in the previous government). A group of 11 mayors then announced that they would form an ""independent"" group, though without leaving the opposition benches.On 24 September, Appéré was named secretary-general of France Urbaine, an association of elected officials from urban municipalities across France. She succeeded the former mayor of Nancy, André Rossinot, in this position. Six months later, she established the ""Idées en Commun"" discussion platform (originally proposed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris), to address housing issues. Appéré then joined Hidalgo on 12 September 2021 for an event launching the Paris mayor's campaign in the 2022 French presidential election.

8,"Manon Aubry (French pronunciation: [manɔn‿obʁi]; born 22 December 1989) is a French politician who represents the left-wing populist party La France Insoumise. A former advocacy officer for Oxfam France, she won a seat in the 2019 European Parliament election and the same year was elected co-chair with Martin Schirdewan of The Left in the European Parliament (GUE/NGL) group.


== Biography ==
Aubry was born in Fréjus in the département of Var. Her parents, Catherine Poggi-Aubry and Bruno Aubry, are journalists of Corsican origin. She first became involved with political activism while studying at the Lycée Saint-Exupéry (sixth form college) in  Saint-Raphaël in 2005, campaigning for the ""no"" vote in the referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty, and against the François Fillon educational reforms. In 2006, she organised a school protest against the First Employment Contract (contrat première embauche), a proposed law which would have made it easier for employers to dimiss young workers.Aubry continued her studies at Sciences Po in Paris, where she was president of the local branch of the National Union of Students of France. After obtaining a degree in international relations and human rights, she spent a year at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, in New York. She then did humanitarian work in Africa for three years, with Médecins du Monde in Liberia and with the Carter Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Returning to Paris, Aubry worked as a senior advocacy officer for Oxfam France from 2014 to 2018. Her particular area of interest was tax justice and inequality. She described how she tracked down multinationals who did not pay their fair share of taxes and rewarded their shareholders rather than the workers who produced the wealth. She also collaborated on a report about banks and tax havens. During this period, she lectured at Sciences Po on human rights.


== Political career ==
Although Aubry had no background in party politics, she was approached by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing party La France Insoumise, to head the party's list of candidates in 2019 European Parliament election. In May 2019 she was elected to the European Parliament and in July 2019 she became the co-chair of The Left in the European Parliament (GUE/NGL) group together with German MEP Martin Schirdewan. She is also co-chair of the Intergroup on the Social Economy.
Within months of election as an MEP, Aubry embarked on the first stage of a bike tour of France with the object of meeting citizens and hearing their views.

The motion was blocked by other groups. Interviewed by Varsity, she said that state repression against pension protests had taken France from a country in ""social crisis to a country in a crisis of democracy"".During the Ninth European Parliament (2019-2024) Aubrey has a seat on the 
following committees: Legal Affairs; Economic and Monetary Affairs; Tax Matters (subcommittee). She was a member of the Conference of Presidents and the Delegation to the Cariform-EU Parliamentary Committee. As rapporteur, she has drafted reports on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers (codification) and on waivers of parliamentary immunity of Marc Tarabella, Andrea Cozzolino, Fulvio Martusciello and Nuno Melo.Since becoming an MEP, Aubry has campaigned for the creation of an independent ethics body to enforce standards across EU institutions.

9,"Martine Louise Marie Aubry (French pronunciation: [maʁtin obʁi]; née Delors; born 8 August 1950) is a French politician. She was the First Secretary of the French Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste, or PS) from November 2008 to April 2012, and has been the Mayor of Lille (Nord) since March 2001; she is also the first woman to hold this position. Her father, Jacques Delors, served as Minister of Finance under President François Mitterrand and was also President of the European Commission.
Aubry joined the PS in 1974, and was appointed Minister of Labour by Prime Minister Édith Cresson in 1991, but lost her position in 1993 after the Right won the legislative elections. However, she became Minister of Social Affairs when Lionel Jospin was appointed Prime Minister in 1997. She is mostly known for having pushed the popular 35-hour workweek law, known as the ""Loi Aubry"", reducing the nominal length of the normal full-time working week from 39 to 35 hours, and the law that created Couverture maladie universelle (Universal health care coverage).
Aubry stepped down from her Cabinet post in 2001 to be elected Mayor of Lille in place of Pierre Mauroy. Aubry subsequently lost her seat in the National Assembly in the general election of 2002. In March 2008, she was re-elected Mayor of Lille, with 66.55% of the votes.
In November 2008, Aubry was elected to lead the Socialist Party, narrowly defeating Ségolène Royal. While Royal disputed the results, the Socialist Party declared on 25 November 2008 that Aubry had won the contested election. On 28 June 2011, Martine Aubry announced she would seek the Socialist nomination to run in the 2012 presidential election, ultimately losing to François Hollande, her predecessor as First Secretary.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Born in Paris, Aubry is the daughter of Jacques Delors, French Minister of Finance (1981–1985) and European Commission President (1985–1995), and his wife Marie. Aubry was educated at the lycée Notre-Dame-des-Oiseaux  and the lycée Paul-Valéry (in Paris). She holds a degree in economic science from Panthéon-Assas University.She did additional studies, gaining a diploma from the Institut des Sciences Sociales du Travail, and one from the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (or Sciences Po) in 1972. Between 1973 and 1975, Aubry studied at the École nationale d'administration (ÉNA, National School of Administration).


=== Professional career ===
In 1975 Aubry became a civil administrator at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Ministère du Travail et des Affaires sociales). During this period, she was active within the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). She became a professor at ÉNA in 1978. In addition, she was seconded to the State Council between 1980 and 1981.
Following the election of François Mitterrand to the French presidency in 1981, Aubry successively held several posts at the Ministry of Social Affairs, in the cabinets of Jean Auroux and Pierre Bérégovoy. In 1984, she investigated French asbestos policy for the Comité Permanent Amiante (Permanent Asbestos Committee, an informal public-private working group formed to manage the health problems of workers affected by asbestos). The group's deputy director, Jean-Luc Pasquier, testified before the courts to account for the group's members' actions.
After the defeat of the socialists in the French legislative election of 1986, Aubry was named Master of Requests at the State Council. From 1989-91 she worked as Assistant Director at Pechiney, working with Jean Gandois. She was involved with the opening of a plant at Dunkerque and the closure of the aluminium works at Noguères.


== Political career ==


=== Minister of Labour, Employment and Vocational Training: 1991–1993 ===
Aubry was named Minister of Labour, Employment and Vocational Training by Édith Cresson, and carried on in this capacity in the Bérégovoy ministry until March 1993. According to Jean-Luc Pasquier, she supported the controlled use of asbestos whilst all other members of the EEC supported an outright ban. She caused the French veto of a European decree against the use of asbestos. France did not ban asbestos until 1997.In January 2010, a public health judge charged with investigating former government measures on asbestos had Aubry interrogated by gendarmes in Lille.When the Right came into power at the French legislative election in 1986, Aubry started the Fondation Agir Contre l'Exclusion (FACE, the Act Against Exclusion Foundation). In 1995, Pierre Mauroy named her as the first deputy to the Mayor of Lille, thus giving her a foothold in the department of Nord.
Lionel Jospin, who became the socialist candidate as French President in 1995, made her his campaign spokesman during the presidential campaign. Upon his defeat, Jospin became first secretary of the Socialist Party, and offered her the number two spot, which Aubry refused.
Aubry had good relations with part of the establishment, especially with her former Pechiney boss, Jean Gandois, and the Parti communiste francais. But she did not get on well with the unions, in particular with Nicole Notat, the former General Secretary of the CFDTAubry has been described as hard and demanding. She counters, ""Je dis les choses en face, je ne suis pas faux-cul. Mais je crois être bien moins dure que beaucoup de gens en politique. Je suis même peut-être trop sensible. (I'm up-front, and I'm not a hypocrite. But I think I'm much less hard than many politicians. I may even be too sensitive.) ""


=== Minister of Employment and Solidarity: 1997–2000 ===

Elected as a member of the National Assembly, Aubry was appointed in 1997 as Minister of Employment and Solidarity, the most important minister after the Prime Minister. The same year, to fight unemployment, she created a new employment contract for young people (Emplois-jeunes) with financial help from the government. In 1998, a law establishing the 35-hour workweek was adopted.
In 1999, the Couverture maladie universelle (CMU), a program that reimburses medical expenses through social security for everyone, was voted through. Furthermore, for people on low incomes, the CMU offers complementary health coverage of 100%, which is added to standard Social Security payments; this avoids the necessity for additional private (top-up) insurance.


=== 2012 Presidential candidacy ===

On 28 June 2011, Aubry said in a televised address from the former train station of Lille-Saint-Sauveur : ""I have decided to propose my candidacy to the presidential election"".Following the first round of the citizens primary, she faced François Hollande in the second round of voting on 16 October in a two-way runoff. In the final round of voting, Hollande won the nomination with 56.6% of the vote.
After Aubry's defeat in the primaries, she became one of the main supporters of the Francois Hollande presidential campaign. Aubry's name had been mentioned as a potential prime minister for François Hollande. But, after Hollande was elected President, he chose Jean-Marc Ayrault as Prime Minister; Aubry refused to join his cabinet.


=== From 2014: statements of divergence ===
On several occasions, Aubry expressed criticism of the Manuel Valls government, including the fact that he was chosen. In October 2014, she asked for a reorientation of the economic policy.During a press conference held on 23 September 2015, where Aubry confirmed the choice of Pierre de Saintignon as the head of list for the next coming Regional Elections, she said that the bad polls of the list are partly caused by some choices of the government. She was criticising Emmanuel Macron, Minister of Economy since 2014, saying: ""Macron? How to tell it... The cup is full.""Ahead of the Socialist Party's 2017 primaries, Aubry publicly endorsed Benoît Hamon as the party's candidate for the presidential election later that year.

12,"Clémentine Autain (French pronunciation: [klemɑ̃tin otɛ̃]; born 26 May 1973) is a French politician and journalist who has represented the 11th constituency of the Seine-Saint-Denis department in the National Assembly since 2017. She is a member of La France Insoumise (LFI).
Autain is the daughter of singer Yvan Dautin and actress Dominique Laffin. A feminist activist, she is co-editor of the monthly publication Regards with Roger Martelli and co-secretary of the Fondation Copernic, a ""circle of reflection"" critical of liberalism.
In 2001, Autain was elected to the Council of Paris for the 17th arrondissement with the support of the French Communist Party, where she served one term. As a councillor, she developed the Conseils de la jeunesse de Paris (Youth Councils of Paris). From 2001 to 2008, she held the title of Deputy Mayor of Paris under Bertrand Delanoë tasked with youth affairs. She was a member of the executive council of the Organisme d'habitations à loyer modéré and Offices publics d'aménagement et de construction, organisations responsible for the management of low-cost housing in Paris. In 2014, she was elected to the municipal council of Sevran, where she served again one term.
Autain has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the 11th constituency of Seine-Saint-Denis since 2017 as a member of La France Insoumise. She currently holds a position in the Bureau of the National Assembly of the 15th legislature of the French Fifth Republic as a secretary. She has also served as a regional councillor of Île-de-France since 2021, previously holding a seat in the regional council from 2015 until her resignation in 2017 to focus on her work as an MP.


== Early life and education ==
Autain was born in Saint-Cloud, the daughter of actress Dominique Laffin and singer Yvan Dautin. Her paternal uncle, François Autain, was a French senator and member of Parti de gauche (Left Party) for Loire-Atlantique, as well as former Deputy Mayor of Bougue and former Secretary of State for Immigration, Defense, and social security during the presidency of François Mitterrand. Her grandfather, André Laffin, a veteran of the Indochina Wars, was briefly elected as a right-wing candidate as a member of UNR in the department of Yonne. Her mother committed suicide in 1985, when Autain was twelve.She has a son and a daughter, born in 2008 and 2010. As of 2022 she has written 15 books, including a novel, Assemblées.Autain studied history at university, earning a master's degree in history (""maîtrise""), with a specialisation in colonial Algeria, and a master's degree (Diplôme d'études approfondies, DEA) examining the Mouvement de libération des femmes (MLF).


== Political career ==
In 2001, the French Communist Party asked her to run at the top of the ballot in the 17th arrondissement of Paris against Françoise de Panafieu, which she described as a ""big bourgeois woman"" with ""appalling class contempt"". Winning with 35% of the vote, the new Mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, named her assistant in charge of youth.
As a representative of the Paris municipality, in 2001 she attended the Universités d'été euroméditerranéennes des homosexualités, where she worried about possible discrimination towards militant bisexuals in the associations within the homosexual world, a ""biphobia"".In 2003, she defended lesbians against the ""phallocratic"" tendencies of some members of gay associations. She denounced the threat that the Centre d'archives gay-lesbiennes de la mairie de Paris could neglect the ""lesbian identity"".In 2005, she signed the Appel des indigènes de la République, before ultimately withdrawing her signature when Tariq Ramadan added his own. During this period, she participated in activities organized by the Conseil représentatif des associations noires de France (CRAN).
In the Group of 29 May, she campaigned against the 2004 Treaty of Rome, the European Constitutional Treaty, during the French referendum on the treaty.
A frequent presence on television screens, in 2006 Clémentine Autain became a possible candidate for Gauche antilibérale. She was declared ready to be a candidate in the 2007 French presidential election on 10 September 2006, at the meeting of the Collectif national d'initiative pour un rassemblement antilibéral de gauche et des candidatures communes where several local groups were in attendance, believing that she answered the needs of some militants for a candidate who did not represent any party, which gave her an advantage over Marie-George Buffet, Olivier Besancenot, Patrick Braouezec, Yves Salesse or José Bové ""to synthesize.""
She participates in the Fondation Copernic, a club for discussions relating to the radical left and to leftist ideas: the RAP with Jacques Kergoat, SELS (Sensibilité écologiste libertaire et radicalement sociale-démocrate) or ""Ramulaud"" (a movement to develop an alternative to the left, named after a restaurant where it was launched). She has also contributed written pieces to L'Humanité. At the end of 2008 – beginning of 2009, she contributed to the creation of the Fédération pour une alternative sociale et écologique (FASE), a political movement whose objective is to ""unite all the forces of transformation and transcendence of capitalism"" and of which she is the spokesperson.


=== Reporting to Paris City Hall ===
As Deputy Youth Mayor of Paris from 2001 to 2007, Clémentine Autain developed the Conseils de la jeunesse de Paris (Youth Councils of Paris), operations charged with providing youth with opportunities for dialogue with elected officials, to contribute their perspectives on important initiatives driving the city (transportation, environment, housing, etc.) and to open projects up to the average Parisian. These operations distribute a budget of approximately  200,000 euros to the councils of the city's arrondissements and another 80,000 euros to the Conseils de la jeunesse de Paris.
Thanks to a 50% increase in the budget directed at youth, Clementine Autain put in place different initiatives: Paris Jeunes Talents, Paris Jeunes Vacances, Paris Jeunes Aventures, Paris Jeunes Solidarité, which provide youth with activities such as job training, professional experience, and educational travel.


=== Reflection ===
After the setback of a planned unitarian antiliberal candidacy, Clémentine Autain decided not to engage in a disunited campaign that was establishing itself: I made the fight for our coming together with the touchstone of my commitment, the key to my identification. It was to make this possible that I was declared a candidate in September. Getting involved in supporting those who will make one segment, necessary but a segment just the same, of anti-liberalism does not conform to what I actually did, said and with what I want to be [...]. It is not easy, when militancy is in the gut, to sit on a shelf instead of being part of a campaign. It's not exciting and you do not do it as friends ... but, in politics, nothing is more important than consistency, over the long haul. I also prefer not to pretend and stay in synch with my deep conviction. I respect the choices of everyone. Mine is to stay true to what I have said and done to date: the convergence of the broader progressive left is my only compass. It does not guide us today, to the presidency. We are going tomorrow.


=== Controversy in Montreuil ===
In May 2007, Clémentine Autain left the 17th arrondissement in Paris for a new home in Montreuil in Seine-Saint-Denis, and sold her former apartment, which she had bought some years previously. Several months later, Clémentine Autain confirmed her intention to not run as a candidate in the 2008 Paris municipal elections. She expressed concerns about a possible alliance of Bertrand Delanoë with MoDem in Paris in the second round of municipal voting.
She stated that she moved to Montreuil to ""learn about the suburb"". Before Clémentine Autain had even moved, there were rumours that she could reinforce the list headed by the outgoing Mayor, Jean-Pierre Brard, who like Autain, was linked with the communists. In reality, there was no substance to the rumours, the move to Montreuil corresponded above all with her personal choice and economic reasons. On her blog, Clémentine Autain confirms ""she had asked nothing of the sort and nothing had been promised"". Brard, who was ultimately defeated by Dominique Voynet, reaffirmed his opposition in principle.
In part motivated by a desire to fight the ""gentrification"" of Montreuil, Clémentine Autain's arrival paradoxically comes in a context of strong social change in the previously more working class community.Living in Montreuil since early 2008, she cohosts a program focusing on political discussion, Paroles de gauche (Words from the Left) and supported the militants without papers during their strike.


=== The Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste ===
During 2008, Autain became involved with the Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste (NPA) (New Anticapitalist Party) under development, launched by the Ligue communiste révolutionnaire.Autain attended the national conference of l'Appel de Politis, a movement to create an alternative to the left. She called for ""an acting out"", making reference to the necessary creation of a new political force. However, this unity did not materialize. Clémentine Autain expressed regret that Olivier Besancenot and the NPA did not seek to build political majorities nor to work and create alliances with others, such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon.Today Autain is active with Fédération pour une alternative sociale et écologique (FASE), for which she is spokesperson. In particular, she has represented FASE at the congress of the Parti de Gauche de Jean-Luc Mélenchon, indicating her desire to work with him despite differences on issues such as secularism, the Republic, the forms of political organisation or the concept of ""revolution through the ballot box"", to which she prefers that of ""democratic revolution"".


== Activism ==
Autain was raped at knifepoint near the Université de Paris VIII when she was 22. She first revealed this publicly in 2006. As the spokesperson for Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the 2012 presidential election, she disclosed this during the presidential pre-campaign as ""a way to bring the issue of violence into the debate"".
 I do not deliver private confidences about what I felt, I do not have a desire to comment on the consequences of the rape in my private life. [...] This part of the experience belongs to me, it will remain to me. [...] But to talk is to be faithful to my commitment. Because silence is playing into the hands of the rapists. [...] My example shows how rape is a taboo subject. My rapist was a repeat offender, he confessed to raping between twenty and thirty women, but only three complaints were filed. Rape is a phenomenon of considerable magnitude and severity, largely left in silence. This rape marked, for her, the start of her engagement in feminism.  She was active in the Union des étudiants communistes. She supported the  Collectif contre le viol and contributed her feminist perspective. She made the Mouvement de libération des femmes (MLF) the thesis topic for her DEA in History. In 1997, she decided to create a new feminist organisation, Mix-Cité, for which she was co-president. The organisation is well known in France for its protests against the use of live models in the display windows of the shopping center Galeries Lafayette.
She next worked as a parliamentary assistant to Georges Mazars, the Senator for the department of Tarn. She worked with Cécile Silhouette, a Paris councilor, who was elected as a representative of Ensemble pour une gauche alternative et écologiste. According to Le Monde, she would also have been close to the leftwing socialist current associated Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

She previously served as France's Minister of Culture under Prime Ministers Manuel Valls and Bernard Cazeneuve from 2016 to 2017.


== Early life and education ==


=== Early life and family ===
Azoulay was born in La Celle-Saint-Cloud to a Moroccan Jewish family from Essaouira. Her father, André Azoulay, is the current senior adviser to King Mohammed VI of Morocco, having previously been the adviser to his predecessor King Hassan II from 1991 to 1999. Her mother, Katia Azoulay, is a Moroccan writer. Her aunt, Éliane, is a journalist for the French magazine Télérama.

=== Education ===
Azoulay gained a master's degree in management sciences from Paris Dauphine University in 1994 and a master's degree in business administration from Lancaster University. She also studied at Sciences Po and the École nationale d'administration (ENA) in 2000 (promotion Averroès, alongside Fleur Pellerin, Alexis Kohler and Nicolas Kazadi among others).


=== Activism and political orientation ===
During her university studies, Azoulay worked at a bank, which she says she ""hated"". During her studies in the École Nationale d'Administration, she says she ""discovered the old French anti-Semitism"".Azoulay recalled having participated in demonstrations against the Devaquet bill in 1986 and against the Juppé plan in 1995, and against the candidature of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round of the 2002 French presidential election. Her role models are Simone Veil and Jean Zay.


== Career ==


=== Career in the public sector ===
In 2000, Azoulay was appointed civil administrator, assigned to the general secretariat of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government. From April 2000 to July 2003, she worked as the head of the public audiovisual sector office, especially for the strategy and the funding of sector organizations in the media development department. At the same time, she manages media expertise missions for the European Commission within the process of pre-accession programs.
In 2003, Azoulay was in charge of the conference on media strategy, audiovisual and cinema financing at Sciences Po. From September 2003 to February 2006, she worked for the Ile-de-France Regional Chamber Accounts and with the committee for inquiry into the cost and performance of public service. In 2004, she appeared in the distribution of the film ""Le Grand Rôle"" by the director Steve Suissa, where she played the director's assistant.
In 2006, Azoulay joined the National Center of Cinematography and the moving image (CNC), successively holding the positions of Deputy Director for Multimedia Affairs, Chief Financial and Legal Officer and Deputy Director-General.From 2014 until 2016, Azoulay served as an advisor on communications and cultural affairs to President François Hollande.


=== Minister of Culture ===
Azoulay succeeded Fleur Pellerin as Minister of Culture on 11 February 2016. During her time in office, she increased her department's budget by 6.6% to a total of €2.9 billion in 2017 – the largest amount of government money promised for the arts in the country's history. Under her leadership, the Ministry lent support to a women's contemporary art prize launched by AWARE (Archives of Women Artists, Research and Exhibitions). Internationally, she played a key role in the joint initiatives of France, the UNESCO and the United Arab Emirates to safeguard cultural heritage in conflict zones, announced in December 2016, and was a signatory to the Florence Declaration condemning the destruction of cultural sites at the first G7 culture summit in March 2017. On 24 March 2017, she presented Draft Resolution 2347 on the protection of cultural heritage in armed conflicts to the UN Security Council. This resolution, put forward by France, Italy and UNESCO, was adopted unanimously.
By the end of 2016, Azoulay eventually decided against becoming a candidate herself in the 2017 French legislative election. In the Socialist Party's presidential primaries, she endorsed Manuel Valls as the party's candidate for the 2017 French presidential election. After the Socialist Party was eliminated in the first round of the election, she publicly declared her support for Emmanuel Macron against Marine Le Pen.


=== Director-General of UNESCO ===
In 2017, Azoulay was one of the nine candidates seeking to succeed Irina Bokova as Director-General of UNESCO. In the final round against Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari, she was elected as Director-General of UNESCO, and her candidacy was presented for approval at UNESCO's general assembly on 10 November 2017. In 2021, Azoulay was elected to a second four-year term.


==== Election ====
Although her chances were considered very slim when she declared her candidacy, she came second in the first round of voting, ahead of Egyptian candidate Moushira Khattab and behind Qatari candidate Hamad Bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari.In the fourth round of balloting, the 58 members of the Executive Board nominated only one of the two finalists, Qatar's Hamad Bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari, who was first with 22 votes. Audrey Azoulay and Moushira Khattab tied for second place with 18 votes. In a new ballot, Audrey Azoulay was chosen as the second candidate, and the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs called on voters to support her.She was elected during a fifth and final round of voting by the 58 members of the Executive Board, with a majority of 30 votes against 28 for the Qatari candidate, who suffered from the division of the Arab world, exacerbated by the Gulf crisis. Audrey Azoulay becomes the second woman to be elected to this position, after Irina Bokova whom she succeeds.The final choice was submitted to the General Conference made up of the 195 member states on November 10, 2017, which endorsed her election to head the Organization. She is officially sworn in on November 13, 2017 at the Organization's headquarters in Paris.


==== Strategic vision ====
Audrey Azoulay takes the head of an institution shaken by economic and diplomatic difficulties. During the election process, the United States, followed by Israel, announced its withdrawal from the Organization, which will take effect at the end of 2018, although the United States will remain an observer.On this matter, Audrey Azoulay stressed in her first speech after her election, ""At a time of crisis, it is more important than ever to get even more involved, to seek to strengthen [UNESCO], not to leave it"", and that her first priority would be to restore the Organization's credibility and the confidence of its Member States.Its candidacy project proposes to focus UNESCO's efforts on ""education as a driving force for development and gender equality"", with particular emphasis on access to education for girls, and to establish the institution as ""a key player in sustainable development"".On April 10, 2018, Audrey Azoulay made her first speech to the UNESCO Executive Board, detailing her vision for the Organization: her top priorities are Africa, gender equality and education; the impact of digital expansion is ""considerable"" and is changing ""the question of heritage, [...] cultural diversity, the dissemination of science""; ""we need to embrace these issues more willingly""; the prevention of violent extremism is an investment"" that she wants to ""strengthen"", particularly by initiating a program to prevent violent extremism ""through youth empowerment in Jordan, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia"" and by publishing a guide for educational communities to combat anti-Semitism.


==== First term (2017-2021) ====
Le Monde points out that, in 2018, she succeeded in ""demining crucial issues that for years had crystallized conflicts within UNESCO"": she succeeded in having a text on the preservation of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem adopted by consensus, including by the Israeli representative, six months before his departure from UNESCO, and the Palestinian representative; she also reached an agreement between Japan and South Korea on the tragedy of the ""comfort women"" rounded up by the Japanese during the Second World War, and obtained a joint submission from North and South Korea for the inclusion of traditional Korean wrestling on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.In February 2018, she launches the Revive the Spirit of Mosul initiative to rebuild the historic center of Iraq's second-largest city destroyed during its occupation by the Islamic State. To implement this project, she raises $50.4 million from the United Arab Emirates, $38.5 million from the European Union and $16.6 million from other countries and funds. With completion planned for 2024, the initiative will have enabled the reconstruction of the Al-Saa'a Convent, the Al-Nouri Mosque and Al-Hadba Minaret, the Al-Tahera Church, as well as the rehabilitation of 124 historic houses. These UNESCO projects have generated more than 6,000 local jobs.In April 2019, following the fire at Notre-Dame de Paris, she proposed UNESCO's assistance for ""a very short-term assessment of the structure and materials"".In November 2019, at the 40th UNESCO General Conference, the 193 Member States unanimously approved an increase in the compulsory contributions of each countries: Le Monde points out that this is ""the first in years"", ""in the midst of a UN meltdown"", and gives credit to Audrey Azoulay, while UNESCO ""was, until two years ago, on the verge of bankruptcy, weakened by the withdrawal, which became effective at the end of 2018, of the United States and Israel"". Le Monde also reports that, in addition to support from Europeans and Africans, she has also found support in the Arab world, notably in Morocco and Jordan, even though she was elected during a period when the Arab countries were divided.
In March 2020, with 87% of the world's school and student population affected by school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Audrey Azoulay launches a ""Global Education Coalition"", calling for ""coordinated and innovative action to build solutions that will not only support students and teachers now, but throughout the recovery process"". More than 200 public, associative and private actors have joined this initiative. Within this initiative, UNESCO is running more than 230 projects in 112 countries, benefiting 400 million pupils and 12 million teachers.Since 2023, Azoulay has been an ex-officio member of the United Nations High-level Panel on the Teaching Profession, co-chaired by Kersti Kaljulaid and Paula-Mae Weekes.Three weeks after the double explosion in the port of Beirut on August 4, 2020, Audrey Azoulay visited the city and pledged that UNESCO would coordinate the rehabilitation of the 280 damaged educational institutions. UNESCO mobilized almost 35 million dollars. Rehabilitation is fully completed eighteen months later.

She studied at the precursor of the University of New Caledonia (UNC), the Université française du Pacifique à Nouméa, also gaining a Masters in Mathematics from the University of Pau in France in 1997, and becoming a qualified computer engineer in 2001 after study at the Université Joseph-Fourier and the Institut polytechnique in Grenoble.Her first job in Nouméa was at the government DTSI (direction des Technologies et Services de l'Information), while also teaching part time at the UNC. In the mid 2000s she worked in trades unions, notably for the CFE-CGC before quitting in 2008 to enter politics. 
She is married to Éric Backès, and has two children.


== Political career ==
She has been associated with several political parties at territorial and provincial levels, holding portfolios ranging from education and schooling to energy, finance, taxation, the digital economy, and higher education. She was with the RPCR Rally for Caledonia in the Republic until 2004, then the Rassemblement-UMP (The Rally–UMP) (2004-2013). By 2012 she was part of a right faction within the UMP calling for a stronger commitment to anti-independence, or 'loyalist' values. She was suspended by Pierre Frogier in 2013, who said ""your political line embodies all the conservatisms and all the archaisms by taking us back 25 years, far from the daring and innovative project that the Rassemblement carries today”. Gaël Yanno and his supporters, including Sonia Backès, created the Caledonian Popular Movement (MPC, Mouvement populaire calédonien) which then won the elections, placing her in a strong position. She moved into the Républicains de Nouvelle-Calédonie (LR-NC) from 2015-2017 and the Républicains calédoniens (RC) from 2017. 
In 2019 she became President of the Provincial Assembly of South Province, a post that gave her considerable political clout.


== Leading figure in New Caledonia's pro-French camp ==
Like the majority of people of European descent living in New Caledonia, Backès remains strongly opposed to an independent New Caledonia, a goal supported by a large segment of the indigenous population. In the runup to a third referendum on independence from France (held in late 2021), she travelled to New York to address the United Nations on 17 June 2021, pleading unsuccessfully before the UN Special Committee on Decolonisation for the removal of New Caledonia from the list of non-self-governing territories arguing that “in New Caledonia, there is no longer an administering power and a colonised people.”In July 2022, Backès, who had become a member of French President Macron’s Renaissance party, was appointed secretary of State for Citizenship in Prime minister Elisabeth Borne’s government. She decided the following year to run for a New Caledonia seat in the September French senatorial elections. Although widely expected to win, she was soundly defeated by Robert Xowie, a pro-independence indigenous Kanak leader. Soon afterward she resigned her ministerial post.

38,"Nicole Belloubet (born 15 June 1955) is a French jurist and politician who has been serving as Minister of National Education in the government of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal since 2024.A former member of the Socialist Party (PS), Belloubet served as Minister of Justice in the government of Prime Minister Édouard Philippe from 21 June 2017 to 6 July 2020; she had been appointed by President Emmanuel Macron following the resignation of François Bayrou. She previously served on the Constitutional Council, to which she was appointed in 2013 by Jean-Pierre Bel, President of the Senate.


== Early life and education ==
Belloubet was born to an engineer from a modest farming family and the manager of a small Parisian hotel.


== Academic career ==
Belloubet began her career in teaching before becoming, at the age of 42, rector of the University of Limoges. She served in that office between 1997 and 2000 before becoming rector of the Academy of Toulouse until 2005. In 2005, she resigned from her post to protest against decisions made by the government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin which wanted to reduce the number of teachers, among other reforms.


== Political career ==
Belloubet joined the Socialist Party (PS) in 1983.From 2000 to 2005, Belloubet chaired the French government's Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for the Promotion of Gender Equality in the Education System. In particular, she drafted reports on ""the future of the lycée"" (2002) and on ""combating gender-based and sexual violence in schools"" (2001). She has also written on secularism and co-education in schools.In parallel to her teaching, Belloubet later pursued a career in local politics, in particular as first deputy to the Socialist Mayor of Toulouse, Pierre Cohen, between 2008 and 2010. In 2010, she became regional councillor for Midi-Pyrénées, of which she was also first vice-president.On 12 February 2013, Belloubet was appointed by Jean-Pierre Bel, President of the Senate, to serve on the Constitutional Council for a nine-year term, succeeding Jacqueline de Guillenchmidt. She became the first woman professor of law appointed to the Constitutional Council, and the seventh female member of the institution.
As Minister of Justice, Belloubet's first major project was to steer through the legislative process two bills on public ethics that were meant to help clean up national politics after hard-fought debates over a clause scrapping lawmakers’ constituency funds, which critics argued encourage clientelism. Internationally, she made headlines in 2019 when she publicly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for European allies to repatriate hundreds of Islamic State fighters from Syria and instead announced that France would be taking back militants on a “case-by-case” basis.In early 2020, the Mila affair erupted over a 16-year-old girl insulting Islam on social media and then receiving violent threats. Belloubet was scrutinised for having erroneously said that insulting religion is against ""freedom of conscience"" in French law. She later corrected herself on the matter.


== Controversy ==
When she joined the government in June 2017, Belloubet omitted to declare part of her shares in several real estate assets, including a house in Aveyron and two apartments in Paris.


== Personal life ==
Belloubet was married Pierre-Laurent Frier, professor of public law at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, until his death in 2005. The couple had three sons.

40,"Esther Benbassa (born 27 March 1950) is a French-Turkish-Israeli historian and politician. She specializes in the history of Jews and other minorities. Since 2011, Benbassa has served as a French senator, representing Paris from 2017 onwards and Val-de-Marne from 2011 to 2017.
Benbassa is an independent. She was previously a member of Europe Ecology – The Greens, but was expelled from its parliamentary group in September 2021 following allegations of psychological workplace bullying by her former parliamentary assistants. This prompted her to leave the party altogether shortly after.


== Early life and education ==
Esther Benbassa was born on 27 March 1950 in Istanbul, Turkey. She is the descendant of a family of Jews expelled from Spain in 1492, emigrating to the Ottoman Empire. After attending primary school at the Isik School and the Sainte-Pulcherie lycée in Istanbul, Benbassa and her family emigrated to Israel when she was 15. There, she studied at the French-language Saint-Joseph school in Jaffa and received a baccalauréat from the French embassy.Benbassa graduated from Tel Aviv University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1972, supporting her education by working in the tourism industry. She moved to France with a scholarship later that year and obtained a master's degree in modern literature from Paris 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis in 1973. In 1974, Benbassa became a French citizen by marriage, making her a triple citizen of France, Israel and Turkey. She received her Certificate of Aptitude for Secondary School Teachers (CAPES) in 1975 and taught in a lycée from 1975 to 1988. This qualification was followed by a diploma in Turkish from the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO) in 1982 and a doctorate in literature and the human and social sciences from Paris 8 in 1987. Benbassa achieved the latter by completing a dissertation titled ""Haim Nahum Efendi, Last Great Rabbi of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1920)"" with Louis Bazin as her doctoral adviser. She had previously drafted a dissertation about the Paris Commune.Benbassa conducted her postdoctoral studies in the department of Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1988 to 1989.


== Academic career ==


=== Jewish history research ===
Benbassa served as director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) from 1989 to 2000, in which year she became the director of studies in religious studies at the Practical School of High Studies (EPHE).Benbassa studied the relationship between Jews and the State of Israel in her books Imaginary Israel (1998) and Do the Jews have a Future (2001), writing that Israel is the realization of the fundamentally secular project known as Zionism and thus, ""forbidding oneself, in the name of an imaginary solidarity, from criticizing the policies of the [Israeli] government is to do a disservice to Israel."" She additionally founded the Alberto Beneviste Centre for Sephardi and Socio-cultural Studies in 2002. Benbassa was also a researcher at the Roland Mousnier Centre, a joint venture of the CNRS, EPHE and Sorbonne University.


=== Promotion of Islamic-Jewish dialogue ===
Along with her husband Jean-Christophe Attias, Benbassa is the co-founder of Le Pari(s) du Vivre-Ensemble, an organization opposing discrimination and promoting diversity. She supports Islamic-Jewish dialogue, writing an essay titled ""The Republic Facing its Minorities. The Jews Yesterday, the Muslims Today"" during widespread political debate surrounding the Law on Religious Symbols in French Public Schools in 2004. Benbassa participated in a conference where she, according to journalist Caroline Fourest, criticized the law by ""explaining to the Muslims that had come see Tariq Ramadan next to her that France was treating it as it had treated the Jews in the past."" She published an anthology titled Jews and Muslims: A Shared History, A Dialogue to Construct in 2006.Following the Charlie Hebdo shooting and Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege in January 2015, Benbassa organized a day of debate on the topic in March of that year. In October, she released a new anthology named Jews and Muslims: Let's Renew Our Links.


== Political career ==


=== Senator from Val-de-Marne and Paris ===
Benbassa was elected to represent Val-de-Marne in the Senate on 25 September 2011 as a member of Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV). As a senator, she was the vice-president of the commission on constitutional law, legislation, universal suffrage, regulations and general administration; member of the strategic committee of the Civil Service Agency; vice-president of the Franco-Turkish friendship group; secretary of the Franco-Israeli friendship group; member of the Franco-Palestinian friendship group; member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and member of the jury of the Senate Thesis Prize.In 2012, Benbassa began to advocate for the right of French expatriates to vote in French elections.Benbassa was the rapporteur for a bill extending the statute of limitations for discriminatory remarks of a homophobic, sexist or ableist character and thereby align it with laws surrounding racial, ethnic or religious discrimination. The bill was unanimously passed into law by the Senate on 30 January 2013. On 28 March 2013, the Senate also passed a law aiming to end public solicitation of sex workers, which Benbassa had introduced in the autumn of 2012.At Benbassa's urging, the Senate laws committee created a fact-finding mission on racial, ethnic and religious discrimination in the autumn of 2012. She served alongside Jean-René Lecerf of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) as the mission's co-rapporteur. Their final report, presented in November 2014, was titled ""The Fight Against Discrimination: From Incantation to Action."" It included twelve proposals, among them the introduction of a census question on the birth country of one's ancestors and respondents' previous nationalities ""in order to obtain measurable findings on the extent of discrimination and its occurrences."" Malika Sorel, former member of the High Council for Integration, criticized the proposals as ""dangerous"" and conducive to the ""exacerbation of tensions in our nation.""In October 2013, in response to the Dibrani case involving the arrest of an illegal immigrant child during a field trip and their immediate deportation, Benbassa commented: ""I, who thought France had not forgotten its sombre history, was far from imagining that in 2013, as an official elected by the people, would be the witness to a police roundup. Because yes, it must be made clear that this was a roundup."" Benbassa's comments were criticized by philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, who argued that ""the constant reference to the Shoah—and I choose my words carefully here—is ignoble."" Journalist Benoît Rayski argued that her statement summarized ""all the most common talking points of supposedly anti-racist indignation.""In February 2014, Benbassa was named vice-president of a Senate special committee examining a bill that would empower efforts to end sex work. It was in this position that she repeatedly expressed her opposition to the proposed punishment of the clients of sex workers.Benbassa authored the first ever French bill for the legalization of cannabis and introduced it in the Senate in January 2014. The legislation was debated until April 2015, when it was rejected. In response, Benbassa organized a Senate conference in October 2016 with the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts's chair of addiction studies, titled ""Legalization of Cannabis: Is Europe Condemned to an Impasse?""Benbassa joined several other senators in introducing a resolution urging other branches of the French government to recognize the State of Palestine, passing in December 2014. She also drafted a resolution for the protection of environmental migrants, which the Senate passed in October 2015.In March 2016, Benbassa led the laws committee in establishing a fact-finding mission on deradicalization, for which she served as co-rapporteur along with Catherine Troendlé of The Republicans (LR). They then published a report on the topic.
In April 2016, Benbassa again sparked controversy after writing an editorial in Libération titled ""The veil is not more alienating than the miniskirt"".During the 2017 French Senate elections, Benbassa headed the EELV list in Paris and was elected for a second term on 24 September 2017. On 3 October, she joined the Communist, Republican, Citizen and Environmentalist group. Since then, Benbasssa has sat on the constitutional law, legislation, universal suffrage, regulations and general administration committee and has served as the vice-president of the senatorial delegation to Overseas France.During her second term, Benbassa has spoken on various issues: she joined the yellow vest protesters; advocated for migrants; denounced living conditions in French prisons, particularly for minors; lobbied against gender-based and sexual violence, especially in the political world and planned to introduce legislation on animal welfare.
In November 2019, Benbassa took part in a protest against Islamophobia organized by several parties and civil society organizations. Controversy arose once more after she published a photograph of herself at the demonstrations accompanied by participants (among them a young girl) wearing a yellow, five-pointed star and a crescent moon of the same colour, all labelled with the English word ""Muslim."" This provoked a wave of allegations of diminishing the Holocaust's importance by comparing it to Islamophobia, noting the star's resemblance to the yellow badge. The magazine Marianne criticized Benbassa for taking advantage of a child for political purposes, arguing that ""in Islamist processions, as in the protest, children are forced into the propaganda of adults and wear slogans that they cannot understand. This is a violation of the charter on the rights of the child."" On 18 November, HuffPost published an editorial supporting Benbassa titled ""Esther Benbassa Honours the Republic"" and signed by over 150 political figures including academics, activists and left-wing political officials.In October 2020, Benbassa became the secretary of the Senate and vice-president of the EELV group. She was expelled from the group on 15 September 2021 following allegations of workplace bullying and consequently became a member of the administrative group of senators not appearing on the list of any group (RASNAG).During the 2022 French presidential election, Benbassa gave her sponsorship to Hélène Thouy.


=== Workplace bullying allegations ===
In July 2021, online newspaper Mediapart published an investigation detailing allegations of coercion and humiliation from Benbassa's parliamentary staff and former students. The accusations included the senator pressuring an assistant to delay a surgical operation by several months, repeatedly threatening her staff and harshly attacking their actions and competence. All accusers described an atmosphere of ""terror"" Benbassa had created among her subordinates. Mediapart also reported high turnover in her office, with over 18 parliamentary assistants having been employed over two terms.Benbassa disputed the version of events published by the newspaper, but nonetheless acknowledged her ""mood swings"" and apologized to ""those that [she had] hurt.""In September 2021, Benbassa was expelled from the Senate EELV group, with the latter explaining that ""Mrs. Benbassa has not disputed some of the witnesses' accounts and has not, to this day, attempted to sue the accusers for defamation."" The senator responded in a press release denouncing the ""sham of internal procedures"" that made a ""farce of due process."" She then left EELV that December.


== Personal life ==
Benbassa is married to Jean-Christophe Attias, who serves as the director of studies at the Practical School of High Studies and won the 2015 Goncourt Prize in Biography. Attias is also her occasional co-author.
Benbassa identifies as an atheist.

== Biography ==
Billard entered politics in May 1968 with the ""comité d'action lycéen"". She studied economics at Panthéon-Assas University, and campaigned against far-right movements, which were especially active there.
In the 1970s, she joined the feminist movement, and was active in the pro-choice movement, and against right-wing dictatorships in Latin America.
After graduating in economics, she had several small jobs, and campaigned with far-left movements, against nuclear energy and in favour of Palestine against Zionism in the 1980s.
She joined Les Verts (""the Greens""), the French ecologist party, in 1993. Between 1995 and 2001, she held the position of representative of the twentieth arrondissement on the City Council of Paris. Between 1996 and 1997, she was spokesperson for Les Verts in Paris.

As a candidate of the Gauche unie (""United Left""), she was elected on 16 June 2002 for the twelfth term (2002–2007) in the first circonscription of Paris, defeating Jean-François Legaret, mayor of the first arrondissement (and candidate of the UMP). Her victory came as a surprise, since she was elected in one of the wealthiest constituencies of Paris, usually a stronghold of the Right. As a matter of fact, she was defeated by a large margin in the first and fourth arrondissements, which have a conservative or liberal majority, but compensated with the left-leaning middle classes of the second and third arrondissements (the so-called ""bourgeois bohemians"").

She served as a member of the French National Assembly representing Yvelines, from 1986 until 2007, when she was appointed Minister of Housing and Urban Development by President Nicolas Sarkozy. She was a candidate in the 2002 French presidential election, in which she scored 1.19% on the first round of balloting.Boutin was the leader of the Christian Democratic Party (Parti Chrétien-démocrate), a socially conservative Christian-democratic party, which is associated with the greater UMP union party. She is best known for her very vocal opposition to civil unions in 1998 and same-sex marriage later on.
In a judgement dated 18 December 2015 the correctional court of Paris condemned Boutin to a fine of €5000 and €2000 for legal damages for having said that homosexuality was an abomination. The verdict is being appealed.She announced on 21 October 2017 that she was leaving politics, resigning as departmental councillor for Yvelines.


== Biography ==
Boutin was born in Levroux, Indre. She married her cousin Louis Boutin in 1967 with whom she had three children (the contradiction between her strong advocacy of Catholic dogmas and marrying one's first cousin remaining strictly forbidden by canon law is often pointed out). She entered politics in 1977 as a city council member of the village of Auffargis. In 1980 she was elected its mayor. Boutin was elected to the National Assembly in 1986.
In 1993, Boutin founded the anti-abortion NGO Alliance pour les droits de la vie (ADV) (English: Alliance for Human Life), considered the largest anti-abortion organization in France. The same year, she became a consultant for the Pontifical Council for the Family headed by Cardinal Lopez-Trujillo.
In 1998, Boutin became somewhat famous because of a five-hour speech in opposition to the PACS domestic partnership plan, arguing that its adoption by the government would encourage homosexuality. She held a Bible during the speech, an image which would later become associated with her.
In 2002, Boutin who had been a member of the UDF party, joined the UMP when it was founded. In a UMP rally that same year, where Boutin spoke, ACT UP Paris protested with a banner calling Boutin homophobic.In 2006, Boutin supported the ""global license"" flat-fee authorization for sharing of copyrighted files over the Internet in a heated parliamentary debate on the DADVSI law. She also has been an advocate for a guaranteed minimum income, as well as expanded housing rights (Droit au logement). She has considered the situation of prisons in France to be a scandal and has argued for a drastic reduction of inmates as well as improving their life-conditions.In December 2006, Boutin announced that she would not be a candidate for the 2007 French Presidential election and pledged her support for the Conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy.On 18 May 2007, after Sarkozy's victory in the presidential election, Boutin was named Minister of Housing and the City in the government of Prime Minister François Fillon. She has taken as advisors the anti-abortion activist Christine de Chefdebien, controversial for a 1992 anti-abortion occupation of a hospital, and the priest Jean-Marie Petitclerc.
Boutin has a liberal view on condom use in Africa to prevent AIDS, saying that contraceptives were necessary, appearing to contradict an earlier view by Pope Benedict XVI. She has however been critical of contraception outside of the AIDS context in Africa. In October 2012, Christine Boutin stated that she remained strongly opposed to same-sex marriage, claiming that it would lead to polygamy. Around the same time, it was also revealed that she received €800,000 from the UMP before deciding not to run for the forthcoming presidential election against its candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy. On a tweet of 14 May 2013 she derided Angelina Jolie's cancer prevention treatment as a sex reassignment procedure; her tweet was widely criticized, but she has not apologized.
In 2014, Christine Boutin launched the ""Force Vie"" list for the 2014 European elections, and failed to secure the 3% of votes required for reimbursement of campaign expenses in any constituency.In the second round of the 2017 French presidential election, she supported Marine Le Pen.In 2022, Boutin announced that she was supporting Éric Zemmour and had joined Reconquête.


=== 9/11 ===
In a November 2006 interview, published in 2007, Boutin stated that George W. Bush might have been behind the September 11 attacks. When asked if she believed that the Bush administration was behind the 9/11 attacks, Boutin replied:

I think that it's possible... I think it is possible. I think it more especially as I know that the sites that speak of this problem are the sites that have the greatest numbers of visits.... And so, I tell myself, I who am extremely sensitive ... to the new techniques of information and communication, that this expression of the mass of the people cannot be without any truth. I'm not telling you that I adhere to that position, but let's say that, nevertheless, I'm questioning myself a bit on this question.

93,"Marie-George Buffet (née Kosellek; born 7 May 1949) is a French politician. She was the head of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 2001 to 2010. She joined the Party in 1969, and she served in the government as Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports from 4 June 1997 to 5 May 2002. Buffet was re-elected on 16 June 2002 to another five-year term in the National Assembly as a representative of Seine-Saint-Denis.
She stood down from Parliament at the 2022 French legislative election.


== Life and career ==
Buffet was born in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine. Her father Paul Kosellek is of Polish descent.
Buffet was elected in 2001 as National Secretary of the Party, succeeding Robert Hue, who assumed the newly created presidency of the party. When Hue resigned after his poor score in the 2002 presidential elections, the post of president was removed, leaving Buffet as sole leader of the Party.
As head of the French Communist Party, Buffet speaks regularly on a variety of topics relating to the plight of the working people. Most of Buffet's speeches tend to focus upon practical implementations of the taxpayer's duty to provide for workers.
Other issues that Buffet is interested in and has spoken on are the Bolkestein Directive (a free trade directive issued by the European Union), energy initiatives, and ideological issues linked with stopping privatization and aiding the lower classes or working people. As a member of the French National Parliament, Buffet has begun to recognize the need to organize with the Communist and Socialist parties of other states within the EU.
This can be seen in the Marie-George Buffet Statement, which came out in June 2005. It constitutes a comment on the aftermath of the referendum on the establishment of further free trade rulings inside the European Union, one which was rejected by the a significant part of the Left. Buffet sees this French Communist victory as a victory for communists across Europe. She remarked:

I invite from the bottom of my heart men and women and organizations of the left, even those who might have voted ""yes"", to take your place, to participate with us in this noble adventure to construct another Europe, a genuine left wing alternative.In 2009, she condemned as ""irresponsible"" and ""criminal"" statements by Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that condoms promote AIDS, although they in fact help prevent it.On 28 February 2013, The Commission des affaires culturelles et de l’éducation, of which Buffet is part, voted in favour of an amendment proposed by Martine Faure, and favoured by Yves Durand, Martine Martinel and Buffet among others, that replaced the biological concepts of ""sex"", with the sociological concepts of ""gender"" in the national elementary curriculum. The elementary curriculum was successfully revised in September 2013 under the name ""l'ABCD de l'egalite"".


=== 2007 presidential bid ===
In 2006, Buffet took part in a ""rally of the anti-liberal left"", in an attempt to reconcile the PCF, the rest of the radical left, and anti-globalization militants, by the nomination of a common candidate for the 2007 French presidential election. As Buffet was voted as candidate by most members of the rally, several other participants fell out, denouncing the Communist Party's influence, effectively crippling the ""anti-liberal left"" and leaving Buffet as candidate for the sole PCF. Buffet had to compete with the radical-left candidacies of Olivier Besancenot, José Bové and Arlette Laguiller. She ended up receiving 1.93% of the popular vote (707,268 votes), the lowest result ever for a Communist presidential candidate in France.

A member of La République En Marche! (LREM), she was its candidate for Mayor of Paris in the 2020 election but failed to reach the second round.
Buzyn, who specialises in hematology, cancer immunology and transplant, spent most of her career as a medical practitioner, professor and researcher at Paris Descartes University (Paris-V) and Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital.
From 2008, Buzyn assumed many responsibilities as part of Health and Nuclear public institutions: president of the administrative counsel of the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IRSN; French: Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire; 2008–2013); member of the committee on nuclear energy of the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA; Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives; 2009–2015); member of the administrative counsel in 2009, then vice-president in 2010, as well as president from 2011 of the National Institute for Cancer (INCa; Institut national du cancer).

She kept the position on 21 June 2017 as part of the Philippe's second government. She resigned on 16 February 2020 to run in the Paris mayoral election, in which she placed third. She was as Health Minister succeeded by Olivier Véran.


== Early life and education ==
Buzyn was born to two Holocaust survivors, her father Elie from Polish Łódź, who survived Buchenwald's death march at age 16, and left for British Palestine after World War II. He became an orthopedic surgeon in Paris and married a French Jewish woman, Etty, whose family hid in France during the war; she became a well-known psychoanalyst and writer.


== Early career ==
Buzyn is a qualified doctor, hematologist and university professor. From 2008 to 2013, she chaired France's Agency for Nuclear Safety and Protection against Radiation (IRSN), a position which involved reassuring the public after Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.She has been head of the French National Cancer Institute and other public health executive boards.

She had never been involved in party politics prior to being nominated similar to other ministers (Culture Minister Françoise Nyssen, Sports Ministers Laura Flessel and Ecology Minister Nicolas Hulot).Early in her tenure, Buzyn signed a charter to promote vaccination with seven national health service guilds, in an effort to counter growing vaccine hesitancy in France. In 2019, she implemented a HAS recommendation according to which the state health insurance system cease all reimbursements for the use of homeopathic cures from 2021. She later steered through parliament a controversial bioethics law extending to homosexual and single women free access to fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) under France's national health insurance; it was one of the campaign promises of President Macron and marked the first major social reform of his five-year term.During France's presidency of the G7 in 2019, Buzyn hosted a G7 Ministers of Health meeting in Paris. She also co-hosted the sixth replenishment meeting of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in Lyon.Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election in France, Buzyn was considered one of the front-runners to top the candidate list of the La République En Marche! party; the role eventually went to Nathalie Loiseau instead.By the end of 2019, addressing concerns that France's free health system was attracting illegal migrants, Buzyn said asylum seekers would have to wait three months before being entitled to healthcare. She assured that restrictions would not apply to children, or emergency care.


=== Candidate for Mayor of Paris, 2020 ===
In February 2020 Buzyn resigned to run as her party's candidate for Mayor of Paris in the 2020 municipal election.

In October 2020, Buzyn was one of several current and former government officials whose home was searched by the authorities following lawsuits about the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In September 2021, she was placed under investigation when Prosecutors at a Paris court decided that there were grounds to prosecute her for ""endangering the lives of others.""

111,"Marine Charrette-Labadie is a French political activist who was one of eight original spokespeople for the ""yellow vests"" (French: gilets jaunes) movement. Her involvement predated the 17 November 2018 protests, when she served as a local organizer in Corrèze, New-Aquitaine in advance for Act I. Charrette-Labadie announced she was retiring from the movement at a national level on 28 November 2018 at a press conference in Brives. She was the sixth of the original eight spokespeople to announce their resignation. Charrette-Labadie continued to participate in the movement at the local level after withdrawing from the national movement.
Charrette-Labadie is from Corrèze, New-Aquitaine. A waitress, she was unemployed at the end of 2018.


== Yellow vest movement ==
Charrette-Labadie, then a 22-year-old, emerged as one of the early spokesperson in the ""yellow vests"" (French: gilets jaunes) movement. She was one of eight official spokespeople. This group was announced on 26 November 2018. During her time as a spokesperson, Charrette-Labadie was contacted constantly by people in the movement asking for updates as to what had been accomplished and by members of the media seeking comment. She was also being contacted by members of many political parties who were seeking to align themselves with the yellow vest leadership.Her involvement predated the 17 November 2018 protests, when she served as a local organizer in advance for Act I. She got involved because she felt like she could not sit idly by and do nothing. Most of Charrette-Labadie's activity took place on Facebook. As a local organizer, she was part of a group of protesters who lifted toll gates in Brives on 17 November 2018. Early on that same week, Charrette-Labadie also participated in protests in front of the tax office in the city.Charrette-Labadie was in Paris around 25 November 2019 for a meeting with the government, where she served as one of the representatives of the movement. After consulting people on Facebook, she and other representatives said they had two things they wanted the government to do: create a citizen's assembly and lower all taxes on people. Her participation was criticized by others in the movement, including local Cana leader Christian Lapauze who said they were not consulted about any demands and the representatives had no legitimacy. On 27 November 2018, she was one of six yellow vests activists to participate in a LCI program called ""The Great Explanation"" (French: La Grande explication).In late November, a photograph of Charrette-Labadie circulated that confused her with a friend of Emmanuel Macron. A conspiracy theory misidentified her, suggesting that Macron, through a female friend, had infiltrated the highest levels of the yellow vest movement.Charrette-Labadie announced she was retiring from the movement at a national level on 28 November 2018 at a press conference in Brives, saying, ""I was tired of it, I was tired and I did not want to fight for people who do not deserve it."" By the time she made the announcement, five of the original eight spokespeople had also resigned. On 29 November 2018, she was invited by France's Prime Minister's office to participate in a meeting with other spokespeople at Matignon. She also participated in a meeting at the Ministry of Ecological Transition with other representatives. The group emerged disappointed.Since the start of the movement and 7 December 2018, Charrette-Labadie appeared on BFMTV, France 2 or TF1 a total of nine times. This tied her for third with Laëtitia Dewalle amongst women acting as media spokespeople, and fourteenth overall.Charrette-Labadie continued to participate in the movement at the local level after withdrawing from the national movement.


== Political beliefs and activism ==
While Charrette-Labadie self-identifies as being a bit to the left, she has stated that she does not belong to any political party. Her involvement with the yellow vest movement was her first instance in political demonstrations.


== Background ==
Charrette-Labadie is from Corrèze, New-Aquitaine. In 2018, she was working as a waitress. Charrette-Labadie was spending almost €200 a month on fuel just to go to work. She would stay at work between shifts on the same day in order to avoid the extra fuel expense of returning home. By the end of 2018, Charrette-Labadie was unemployed.
