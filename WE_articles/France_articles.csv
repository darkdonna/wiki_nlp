Since March 2010, she served as  President of the Directorate ERDF (Électricité Réseau Distribution France). She was the woman at the head of the largest French company in terms of number of employees (35,000), until 2014.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and family ===
She is the daughter of Jeanine Carlier, a nursery school principal, and André Carlier, agricultural equipment trader, Michèle Bellon grew up in the town of Bapaume. She studied at the Gambetta School in Arras in 1961, then completed her final year at the Fénelon School in Lille in 1965.
She has been married since July 29, 1972. She has two children and is a grandmother.


=== Education ===
Bellon trained at École Centrale Paris, now CentraleSupélec. She continued her studies in the United States where she obtained a Master of Science in Nuclear Engineering from Northwestern University.


=== Career at EDF ===
In 1974, Michèle Bellon joined EDF as Principal Engineer and then deputy to the Head of Service in the Equipment Department during the seventeen years she spent there.
In 1991, she became the first woman appointed deputy director, responsible for the Engineering Studies Department of the National Center for Thermal Equipment. She then developed several international power plant projects.In 1995, Michèle Bellon joined the Personnel and Social Relations Department of EDF-GDF (180,000 employees) as Project Director and then Deputy Director. In these functions, she was responsible for social negotiations within EDF (employment, working time, training, salaries, integration of the handicap, etc.) in the context of the 1995 strikes.From 1999 to 2000, she was Deputy Director, in the clientele division of the Presidency and General Management of EDF. She then participated in the international development of the company (EDF Energy, EnBW, and EDF Trading). In mid-2000, Michèle Bellon was appointed Director of the Fuel Division of EDF Pôle Industrie.


=== Managing Dalkia ===
As part of her functions within the clientele division, Michèle Bellon ensured EDF's acquisition of capital of the energy division of Veolia: Dalkia.In 2001, she joined the Veolia Group, at the request of EDF, as Deputy Director-General of Veolia Energy (Dalkia) and Director General of Dalkia International. As the main contact for local authorities, she is also responsible for negotiating with industrial partners.


=== Director of ERDF ===
In March 2010, she was appointed Chairman of the Board of ERDF after the departure of Michel Francony. She sees ERDF as ""a company that rests on two feet: Men and women, skills, with real expertise, real dedication, a real commitment to public service. And the technologies, the technologies of cables and transformers, but also the tomorrow of smart meters.""Another project she is working on is improving relations with the FNCCR, the national federation of authorities granting electricity distribution networks. For this, the regional organization of ERDF was reviewed under her supervision in order to facilitate contacts between ERDF managers and local elected officials. Michèle Bellon has also undertaken dialogue directly with the granting authorities, to sign several charters with representatives of local authorities (FNCCR, AMRF ...). Involved in the field of disability integration, the ERDF manager also signed with Éric Besson, Minister of Industry, a cooperation agreement in September 2011, to reduce the “digital divide” suffered by the most vulnerable people. On the place of women in the business world, Michèle Bellon admits that ""we are not very numerous as business owners"" and that within ERDF its objective is to reach 20% of women in the company by 2015 (18% mid-2012).In order to modernize the electricity distribution network, Michèle Bellon is involved in the development of smart electricity networks, in particular through the smart meter ""Linky,"" to ensure the integration into the network of renewable energy and the development of the electric car. At the onset of the Grid4EU project, the director of ERDF works to coordinate the different European initiatives in the field of smart grids. At the national level, this desire is reflected in the multiplication of experiments with these new types of networks (NiceGrid, GreenLys…). In November 2012, the chairman of the ERDF management board accompanied Delphine Batho, Minister of Ecology, on a visit to the Landis+Gyr plant in Montluçon where the Linky smart meters produced by this company are assembled.Since the arrival of Michèle Bellon, the average power outage time has fallen by 39% between 2010 and 2011. This improvement is explained by much more favorable weather than the previous year. The increase in ERDF investments to nearly 3 billion euros per year could have a stabilizing effect in the long term, while improving the financial situation of the company. During Cyclone Joachim, Michèle Bellon intervened in the management of the crisis unit and the rapid intervention force for electricity mobilized by ERDF in the event of large-scale power cuts.
Her first term ended in December 2012, Michèle Bellon was re-elected on January 11, 2013 as the head of ERDF.On January 24, 2014, she left the position of chairman of the ERDF management board to Philippe Monloubou, as she turned 65 and reached the age limit set in ERDF's statutes.

4,"Liliane Henriette Charlotte Bettencourt (French pronunciation: [lil.jan be.tɑ̃.kuːʁ]; née Schueller; 21 October 1922 – 21 September 2017) was a French heiress, socialite and businesswoman. She was a board member and one of the principal shareholders of L'Oréal. At the time of her death, she was the richest woman, and the 14th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$44.3 billion.


== Biography ==
She was born Liliane Henriette Charlotte Schueller on 21 October 1922 in Paris, the only child of Louise Madeleine Berthe (née Doncieux) and Eugène Schueller, the founder of L'Oréal, one of the world's largest cosmetics and beauty companies. When Liliane was five years old, her mother died, and she formed a close bond with her father, who later married Liliane's British governess. At the age of 15, she joined her father's company as an apprentice, mixing cosmetics and labelling bottles of shampoo.In 1950, she married French politician André Bettencourt, who served as a cabinet minister in French governments of the 1960s and 1970s and rose to become deputy chairman of L'Oréal. Mr. Bettencourt had been a member of La Cagoule, a violent French fascist pro-Nazi group that Liliane's father, a Nazi sympathizer, had funded and supported in the 1930s and whose members were arrested in 1937. After the war, her husband, like other members of La Cagoule, was given refuge at L'Oréal despite his politically inconvenient past. Eventually, the Bettencourts settled in an Art Moderne mansion built in 1951 on rue de Delabordère in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. They had one daughter, Françoise, who was born in 1953.In 1957, Bettencourt inherited the L'Oréal fortune when her father died, becoming the principal shareholder. In 1963, the company went public, although Bettencourt continued to own a majority stake. In 1974, in fear that the company would be nationalised after the French elections, she exchanged almost half of her stake for a three percent (3%) stake in Nestlé
S.A.As of December 2012, Bettencourt owned 185,661,879 (30.5%) of the outstanding shares of L'Oréal, of which 76,441,389 (12.56%) shares were effectively held in trust (for her daughter). The remainder were owned as follows: 178,381,021 (29.78%) shares owned by Nestlé, 229,933,941 (37.76%) shares were publicly held, and the remainder were held as treasury stock or in the company savings plan. The Bettencourt family and Nestlé acted in concert pursuant to a shareholders' agreement. Bettencourt ended her board director tenure on 13 February 2012 and her grandson, Jean-Victor, was appointed as board director. Bettencourt's daughter and her daughter's husband (Jean-Pierre Meyers) are also members of the board of directors.Bettencourt generally shunned media attention and granted few interviews. From 2007, she faced intense media scrutiny and publicity over her relationship with François-Marie Banier, the estrangement with her daughter Françoise and her alleged funding of conservative French politicians, including former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In August 2012, she sold her private island, D'Arros Island, to a Seychelles-registered conservation business linked to the Swiss Save our Seas Foundation, for £60 million.Bettencourt died on 21 September 2017. The funeral service was held at Église Saint-Pierre in Neuilly-sur-Seine.


== Philanthropy ==
In 1987, Bettencourt, together with her husband and daughter, founded the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation (la Fondation Bettencourt Schueller) to support and develop medical, cultural and humanitarian projects. The foundation is based in Neuilly-sur-Seine. The foundation, which benefits from assets of €150 million and an annual budget of approx €15 million devotes approximately 55% of its funds to scientific education and research, 33% to humanitarian and social projects and 12% to culture and arts.In 2008, the foundation helped fund the new Monet wing at the Musée Marmottan Monet. Conversely, in 2007 Bettencourt was jointly ""awarded"" a Black Planet Award, an award given for destroying the planet, along with Peter Brabeck-Letmathe for proliferating contaminated baby food, monopolising water resources, and tolerating child labour.


== Art collection ==
Bettencourt had an art collection that was said to include Matisse, Picasso, Fernand Léger, Derain, Soutine, Mondrian  and Ruhlmann furniture.


== ""L'affaire Bettencourt"" ==
By most accounts Bettencourt met François-Marie Banier, a French writer, artist and celebrity photographer, in 1987 when he was commissioned to photograph her for the French magazine Egoïste. Over the ensuing years, Banier and Bettencourt became friends and she became his benefactor, bestowing gifts upon him estimated to be worth as much as €1.3 billion. These gifts include, amongst other things, a life insurance policy worth €253 million in 2003, another life insurance policy worth €262 million in 2006, 11 works of art in 2001 valued at €20 million, including paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian, Delaunay and Léger, a photograph by surrealist Man Ray, and cash. The life insurance policies were allegedly signed over to Banier after Bettencourt was recovering from two hospital stays in 2003 and 2006. In April 2013, Forbes magazine listed Liliane Bettencourt as the world's richest woman in 1999 at a value of $30 billion.In December 2007, just a month after the death of her father, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers lodged a criminal complaint against Banier, accusing him of abus de faiblesse (or the exploitation of a physical or psychological weakness for personal gain) over Bettencourt. As a result of her complaint, the Brigade Financière, the financial investigative arm of the French national police, opened an investigation and, after interviewing members of Bettencourt's staff, determined to present the case to a court in Nanterre for trial in September 2009. In December 2009, the court delayed ruling on the case until April 2010 (later extended until July 2010) pending the results of a medical examination of Bettencourt's mental state. However, Bettencourt refused to submit to these examinations.In July 2010, the trial was adjourned again until autumn 2010, at the earliest, after details of tape recordings made by Bettencourt's butler, Pascal Bonnefoy, became public. The tapes, which were turned over to police, consisted of over 21 hours of conversation and were made because the butler had feared that Bettencourt was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and was being duped. The tapes allegedly reveal that Bettencourt had made Banier her ""sole heir"", excluding the L'Oréal shares which make up the bulk of Bettencourt's estate and which had already been signed over to her daughter and two grandsons.On 6 December 2010, Bettencourt reconciled with her daughter, ending a series of lawsuits. It is reported that Bettencourt and Banier had separated, and he was eventually written out of Bettencourt's will. The spat reignited over the following summer, however, when Bettencourt said her daughter needed to seek psychological help, which renewed their estrangement.


=== Guardianship ===
On 8 June 2011, it was reported daughter Meyers had filed an application with the court to make Bettencourt a ward of the state for her health and being incapable of the management of her fortune. On 17 October 2011, a French judge ruled that she was to be placed under the guardianship of members of her family on concerns about Bettencourt's declining mental health. Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, along with Bettencourt's two grandsons, gained control of her wealth and property. One of the grandsons was additionally named as her personal guardian. Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer said he would appeal, and told Le Monde newspaper that ""Mrs. Bettencourt was ready for 'nuclear war' with her daughter."" As of 2014, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers is guardian of the fortune, while Francoise's son, L’Oréal Board member and member of the supervisory board of the Bettencourt family holding company, Tethys, Jean-Victor Meyers oversees her health and personal life after a judge determined he was the only person able to ""ward off all conflict between Liliane Bettencourt and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.""


== Madoff victim ==
Bettencourt was reported to be one of the most high-profile victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, losing €22 million. She was the first investor in a fund managed by Access International Advisors, which was co-founded by René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet. De la Villehuchet died by suicide on 22 December 2008, after it became known that his funds had invested a substantial amount of their capital with Madoff.


== Political scandal ==
In June 2010, during the Bettencourt affair, Bettencourt became embroiled in a high-level French political scandal after other details of the tape recordings made by her butler became public. The tapes allegedly picked up conversations between Bettencourt and her financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre, which indicate that Bettencourt may have avoided paying taxes by keeping a substantial amount of cash in undeclared Swiss bank accounts. The tapes also allegedly captured a conversation between Bettencourt and French budget minister Éric Woerth, who was soliciting a job for his wife managing Bettencourt's wealth, while running a high-profile campaign to catch wealthy tax evaders as the budget minister. Moreover, Bettencourt received a €30 million tax rebate while Woerth was budget minister.In July 2010, the scandal widened after Bettencourt's former accountant, Claire Thibout, alleged in an interview with the French investigative website Mediapart, that conservative French politicians were frequently given envelopes stuffed with cash at Bettencourt's mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine. She alleged that Woerth, while acting as treasurer for the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), was given an envelope containing €150,000 in cash in March 2007 towards the presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy. She also made, then retracted, a claim that Sarkozy was a frequent visitor to the Bettencourt's home while he was mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1983 to 2002 and received envelopes containing cash. A few days later, she declared she had been pressured by French police to retract her testimony about Nicolas Sarkozy's illegal cash. Mr Sarkozy and Mr Woerth both deny wrongdoing. Following these allegations, French police raided the home and office of de Maistre, who heads Clymène, the company owned by Bettencourt to manage her wealth. French law limits political donations to €7,500 for political parties and €4,600 for individuals. Contributions above €150 must be paid by cheque with the donor clearly identified.


== Forbes' rankings ==
Forbes ranked Bettencourt in its list of the world's wealthiest persons with an estimated fortune of US$38.8 billion (as of 28 June 2016). As of 2016, she was the top female billionaire in the world, and was also the richest person in France.In 2005, Forbes judged her to be the 39th most powerful woman in the world.

11,"Geneviève Suzanne Marie-Thérèse Mulmann (30 August 1932 – 1 August 2023), known professionally as Geneviève de Fontenay (French pronunciation: [ʒənvjɛv də fɔ̃tnɛ]), was a French businesswoman who served as the president of the Miss France Committee from 1981 until 2007. After leaving her position with Miss France, Fontenay created the beauty pageant Miss Prestige National in 2010, and served as its president until her retirement in 2016.


== Early life and education ==
Geneviève Suzanne Marie-Thérèse Mulmann was born on 30 August 1932 in Longwy, Lorraine, as the daughter of André Mulmann and Marie-Thérèse Martin. The eldest of ten children, her father was a mining engineer at the Hagondange steelworks. Fontenay was educated at a hospitality school in Strasbourg, and later moved to Paris to train as a beautician at age 17. In the 1950s, Fontenay settled in Saint-Cloud with her partner, where she began to work as a fashion designer and model.


== Career ==


=== Miss France (1954–2010) ===
Fontenay began her career with the Miss France Committee in 1954 as its general secretary, often taking on extra roles such as chauffeur, coach and costume designer. After Fontenay's partner Louis Poirot became the general delegate of Miss France, Fontenay became his assistant in 1962.Fontenay became the president of the Miss France Committee in 1981, following the death of Poirot, who had previously held the office. Upon taking control of the organization, Fontenay and her son, Xavier Poirot de Fontenay, transformed the organization into a company. In 2002, they sold portions of the business to Endemol Shine France, to assist with commercial and television aspects of the organization.Fontenay ignited controversy in France in the aftermath of Miss France 2008 in December 2007, with the crowning of winner Valérie Bègue. Two weeks following Bègue's victory, clothed but suggestive photos of Bègue were released by the French tabloid Entrevue. After the release of the photos, Fontenay appeared on French radio demanding that Bègue resign her title due to the photos or she would be forcibly dethroned, adding that if Endemol Shine France disagreed with the decision, Fontenay would resign as president. Four years prior, Fontenay had successfully obtained the ouster of Lætitia Bléger as Miss France 2004, as Bléger was revealed to have posed nude in the French edition of Playboy, for a ban of six months. When Bègue refused to resign, Fontenay was accused of racism for stating that Bègue should have stayed in her home region of Réunion, part of overseas France, which led to uproar within Réunion. Fontenay ultimately came to a compromise with Bègue, allowing her to remain Miss France while losing the right to represent France internationally at Miss Universe and Miss World.In the aftermath of the controversy with Bègue, Fontenay left her position as president of the Miss France Committee, while remaining affiliated with the organization. She was replaced by Sylvie Tellier, who began to serve as national director of Miss France, taking on much of the responsibilities previously held by Fontenay as the public face of the competition.In 2010, Fontenay officially cut ties with Miss France.


=== Miss Prestige Nationale (2010–2016) ===
After severing ties with the Miss France Committee in 2010, Fontenay announced plans to start her own national beauty pageant meant to serve as a competitor to Miss France. Later that year, she launched Miss Nationale, serving as its inaugural president. Following a legal dispute with Michel Le Parmentier, the owner of the Miss Nationale brand, Fontenay confirmed that the pageant would be renamed to Miss Prestige Nationale in 2011. In January 2016, Fontenay stepped down from her role with Miss Prestige Nationale in order to retire from the beauty pageant industry.


== Public image ==
Throughout her time as a public figure, Fontenay cultivated a reputation for her style of dress. From 1957 until her death, Fontenay continuously wore a brimmed hat in all of her public appearances, while her outfits were almost always made from a black and white color palette. According to Fontenay, she had adopted this style at the advice of her long-term partner Louis Poirot, as he claimed that her head was too small for her body, and a hat would disguise that. The hat became Fontenay's trademark, and she became known as la Dame au Chapeau (English: The lady in the hat) by the French media.In 2015, Fontenay revealed that she was reportedly offered the Legion of Honour, the highest French order of merit, but declined to be honoured, stating ""It's really desacralizing the ribbon to distribute it to anyone, like chocolate medals.""


== Personal life ==
Fontenay first met Louis Poirot in 1952, and they became long-term partners when they met again in 1954. Despite claiming to be a former French Resistance fighter and journalist, Poirot was a fraudster who had been convicted of fraud and forgery. As Poirot used the name Louis Poirot de Fontenay professionally, Fontenay also adopted the de Fontenay surname.  The couple had two sons together: Ludovic (1954–1984) and Xavier (born 1961). Poirot died in 1981.


=== Political views ===
Fontenay had been outspoken about her political beliefs throughout her time as a public figure. Fontenay supported Arlette Laguiller of Lutte Ouvrière in the 2002 French presidential election, Ségolène Royal of the Socialist Party (PS) in the 2007 presidential election, and François Hollande of PS in the 2012 presidential election. She supported Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential election, although she later became a critic of his. Fontenay described her voting history by saying ""I have always voted for the left, except when I voted for Jacques Chirac against Le Pen,"" referring to the second round of the 2002 presidential election. She also initially supported the yellow vests protests, despite eventually opposing the movement due to disruptions to traffic.Despite her support for left-wing politics, Fontenay had also been outspoken as a social conservative. In 2016, she publicly came out against LGBT parenting, surrogacy, and assisted reproductive technology for same-sex couples, and joined the La Manif pour tous movement campaigning against same-sex marriage in France. In April 2018, she criticized the ""anti-social policy"" of Macron by joining an initiative led by Florian Philippot of the far-right The Patriots political party, despite later distancing herself from Philippot. In 2019, when Sylvie Tellier stated that she ""would not oppose"" transgender women taking part in Miss France, Fontenay referred to the idea as ""against nature"" and ""dishonorable,"" and that it would ""dirty the title of Miss France.""


=== Death ===
On 2 August 2023, Fontenay's son announced that she had died in her sleep of cardiac arrest on the night of 1 August, at her Saint-Cloud home. She was 90. She had been growing weak in the time prior to her death, and spent her last moments with her brother and granddaughter.

14,"Olivia Giacobetti (born 1966) is a French perfumer. She has an independent line called Iunx and has also created fragrances for Diptyque, L'Artisan Parfumeur, Guerlain, and Hermès, among other lines. She is particularly known for a refined style as well as innovation such as her novel use of fig in perfumery, popularizing the note beginning in the mid-1990s. She is among the perfumers who became prominent in a late-20th and early-21st-century turn toward the ""nose"" behind the scent and independent lines that foreground these creators, a shift away from perfumes sold by fashion labels or celebrities in other fields.


== Early life ==
Olivia Giacobetti was born in 1966. Her father Francis Giacobetti is an artist. Olivia Giacobetti was first drawn to perfumery at nine years old when she saw the Jean-Paul Rappeneau film Lovers Like Us, in which Yves Montand played a perfumer.


== Career ==
Giacobetti began working in perfumery for Annick Goutal when she was 16 years old. She joined French fragrance and flavor firm Robertet the following year and worked there for seven years as an assistant perfumer.Giacobetti started her own company, Iskia, in 1990, then aged 24. Working out of a garden-laboratory in Paris's ninth arrondissement, she began taking commissions from lines like L'Artisan Parfumeur, Diptyque, and Hermès.In March 2003, backed by Japanese cosmetics conglomerate Shiseido, Giacobetti started her own line of perfumes as well as candles and body products, called Iunx. Located in a large boutique at 48–50, rue de l’Université in Paris that Giacobetti developed with her father Francis, the original ambition was to create 60 scents, but the line struggled to find an audience and closed after two years. However, beginning in 2006 Iunx products were made available in a boutique in Hôtel Costes in Paris, where Giacobetti had also created the house signature scent in 1995, one of the first hotels to make such a commission. In 2016, Giacobetti opened a new Iunx boutique at 13, rue de Tournon in Paris.In 2017, Giacobetti developed a line of five candles in collaboration with the Comédie-Française.


== Style and impact on perfumery ==
Giacobetti drew recognition early in her career for developing the use of fig as a note in perfume, particularly in 1994 fragrance Premier Figuier for L'Artisan Parfumeur and the 1996 Philosykos for Diptyque (the line's best-seller), both scents inspired by the fig tree; numerous other lines followed suit with fig fragrances of their own in the latter part of the decade. In Perfumes: The Guide, Luca Turin writes, ""Premier Figuier was the fragrance that put Olivia Giacobetti on the map, and deservedly so: its fig-leaf note...was an overdue natural in perfumery, and pleasantly jarring.""Among Giacobetti's best-known creations is En Passant, a subtle but innovative floral fragrance that combines lilac with notes of wheat and cucumber to evoke spring rain on fresh flowers. In The Guide, Turin's co-author Tania Sanchez calls En Passant ""a perfect example of Olivia Giacobetti's tendency...a fine white-on-white painting."" Launched in 2000 by French niche perfume line Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, the fragrance was part of a turn toward the recognition of the perfumer behind the scent, with Malle including not only the name of the perfume and brand on his bottles' labels, but also the ""nose"" who created the fragrance. In turn, Giacobetti is among the perfumers who have raised the profile and sales of such independent and niche perfume lines, where (with a few exceptions) fashion labels and celebrity licensees previously dominated the perfume market. En Passant was featured in a 2017 exhibit on contemporary perfumery at Somerset House in London.Giacobetti also received acclaim for her 1999 creation L'Artisan Parfumeur Dzing!, a scent inspired by Paris's Cirque d'Hiver. Discussing Dzing! in The New York Times, Chandler Burr called the perfume ""one of the most innovative, authentically strange scents of the past two decades"", managing to combine diverse aromas of sawdust, circus animals, caramel apples and more into ""a comforting, subtly succulent mix."" Burr writes: ""Dzing! plays subtle purity against subtle power; it's fresh without green (a trick that takes serious perfumer talent to pull off), sweet without sugar (ditto), warm and soft like a plank of newly sawed pine still warm from the blade."" Turin gave the perfume five stars in The Guide, saying ""Olivia Giacobetti is at her imaginative, humorous best, and Dzing! is a masterpiece.""Giacobetti's scents are generally mixed-media, employing both natural and lab-developed synthetic ingredients. She describes these elements as ""indissociable"", with potent synthetic ingredients providing the fragrance's ""spine"" and natural ingredients adding ""nuances"". An exception to Giacobetti's mixed-media practice are her fragrances for Honoré des Prés, an all-naturals line.


== Personal life ==
Giacobetti lives in Paris. She has a daughter, born in 1996.

15,"Josephine Goube is a French entrepreneur and refugee advocate currently serving as the founder and CEO of Sistech.


== Education ==
Josephine Goube grew up in France, where her early life experiences laid the groundwork for her future career in social entrepreneurship and humanitarian work [1]. Her academic journey started at renowned French institutions, and her pursuit of higher education led her to Paris Institute of Political Studies in 2006–2010, a prestigious university in Paris known for its focus on political science and international relations. At Sciences Po, Goube delved into topics such as urban planning and social advocacy, which broadened her perspective on societal issues [1].
Her academic path then took her to the London School of Economics and Political Science, a leading institution for studying economics and political science. Here, Goube further explored international affairs, gaining insights into global dynamics and the complexities of migration.


== Career ==
Goube's career began in tech and social startup incubator projects in London while she was still at LSE. She played various roles fostering entrepreneurship in the UK and Europe, including contributions to NACUE, StartupBootcamp European Accelerator, and as a fellow from the New Entrepreneurs Foundation. Her work at the Springboard London Accelerator Programme at Google's first startup campus laid the groundwork for her future endeavors. In 2012, Goube collaborated with Italian entrepreneur Marco Muccini to create Migreat, an online platform offering free visa information to migrants [6]. In 2013, she co-founded Girls In Tech London with the support of Roxanne Varza, further expanding her involvement in the tech community and her commitment to social causes.
In 2016, Goube's career took a pivotal turn when she joined Techfugees, a non-profit organization that uses technology to assist refugees [2]. Under her leadership, Techfugees expanded its reach to 10 countries, including Canada, Kenya, and Lebanon, and involved over 4,000 people in its programs [1]. One of Techfugees' key initiatives, the #TF4Women Fellowship Program, was launched by Goube in 2018. This program, aimed at integrating refugee women into tech and digital jobs, started with a small team but grew into extensive programs in France, Italy, and Greece, providing mentoring, training, and networking opportunities [5].
In addition to Techfugees, Goube also played a crucial role in Sistech, a non-profit founded in 2017 to support displaced women accessing tech and digital jobs. By 2021, the #TF4Women programs under Techfugees expanded to new countries, serving four times more women [5]. In 2022, Goube decided to spin off the initiative under Sistech, marking a new chapter in her journey to support refugee women [4].
Josephine Goube has sat on the board of the Norwegian Refugee Council since 2018, has been a Schmidt Futures Fellow since 2022 and acted as an expert for the European Commission on migration reforms related to the Blue Card from 2015 until early 2020.Three times in a row on the Forbes 30 under 30 list, she became known in the UK as one of Marie Claire UK's ""Women at the Top"" for her work as a Migration Campaigner in 2015.  and named as one of ""35 Women Under 35"" to watch by Management Today.


== Impact ==
Goube's journey and the growth of Techfugees are more than just a story of personal success; they represent a model of how empathy, innovation, and technology can come together to address complex societal challenges. Her efforts have gained recognition in the global community, underscoring the potential of technology-driven solutions in humanitarian contexts.
In summary, Josephine Goube's career is a testament to the power of innovative thinking in tackling global issues. Her work at Techfugees, blending technological tools with humanitarian aid, continues to offer practical, prominent solutions for the challenges faced by displaced people. As the world confronts increasing migration due to various factors, including climate change, Goube's strategies and insights remain more relevant than ever, providing a blueprint for how technology can be harnessed to create a more inclusive and compassionate world.

20,"Anne Lauvergeon (born 2 August 1959) is a French businesswoman who served as CEO of Areva from 2001 until 2011. According to The Wall Street Journal, she is known internationally as one of the most prominent defenders of nuclear power.


== Early life and education ==
Lauvergeon was born into a middle-class family in Dijon, Côte-d'Or; her father taught history and her mother was a social worker. Her grandfather was mayor of a village in Burgundy. She later grew up in Orléans, where her father became a professor of geography.Lauvergeon attended the École normale de jeunes filles to pass the Agrégation in physics. Then she entered the Corps des Mines. In 1983 she enrolled in her first vocational course with the Corps de Mines, in the iron and steel industry, at Usinor. A second vocational course, in 1984, took place with the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique, where she studied chemical safety in Europe.


== Career ==


=== Early beginnings ===
From 1985 to 1988, Lauvergeon was with the l'Inspection générale des carrières (IGC). In 1990, she was placed in charge of the mission for the international economy and foreign trade by French President François Mitterrand. The following year, she became assistant secretary-general. She was then named ""sherpa"", i.e. personal representative to the president, and responsible for preparing international meetings such as the G7 summit.
In 1995, Lauvergeon joined the banking sector, and became a managing partner of Lazard; she was the only woman partner at the firm. While at Lazard, she spent several months at the investment bank's New York office. In late 1996, she left the firm after difficulties with Édouard Stern; according to media reports at the time, Stern had particularly taken exception to an invitation that Lauvergeon received to join the board of French aluminium company Pechiney.In March 1997, Lauvergeon was appointed general director of Alcatel, before becoming part of the group's executive committee. In that capacity, she was responsible for international activities and the company's industrial shareholdings in the energy and nuclear fields.


=== Career at Areva ===
In June 1999 Lauvergeon was appointed CEO of the group Cogema, succeeding Jean Syrota, who resigned under pressure from The Greens. In July 2001, she merged Cogema, Framatome and other companies to create Areva. At the head of the new company, she became a member of the small circle of women directing international corporations; in September 2002, daily economic newspaper Les Échos uncovered a report from the French Court of Auditors, citing Lauvergeon's compensation (salary of €305,000 with a bonus of €122,000) and ""golden parachute"" of two years' wages.In 2004, Lauvergeon resisted a request from Nicolas Sarkozy, then finance minister, to help bail out French transport and energy company Alstom. When Alstom's leadership announced plans in 2008 to create a heavy-engineering conglomerate by combining Alstom and Areva in a single entity, Lauvergeon reiterated her opposition.Under Lauvergeon, Areva instead developed into a one-stop shop for nuclear energy. The company became one of the world's top uranium producers and mining accounted for 12 per cent of its 2010 revenue. On 10 July 2008 in the French economic paper Challenges, she stated: ""Uranium is a main part of our success. Our model is... Nespresso: we sell coffee machines and the coffee that fits them. And coffee is very profitable. So in China, we sold two nuclear islands, plus 35% of our uranium production. This is our integrated business model"".Towards the end of 2006, Areva encountered difficulties with its new European Pressurized Reactor and announced an expected delay of eighteen months to three years for its delivery, according to the French daily newspaper La Tribune. The reactor is to be the first of its kind in Finland. The delay may cost €700 million. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, she traveled frequently to Japan and spoke out in regular television appearances in support of nuclear power.In addition to her role at Areva, Lauvergeon was part of other political and business initiatives. In 2001, France's Minister of Science Roger-Gérard Schwartzenberg chose her to chair the ""national contest of assistance the creation of companies of innovating technologies"". In June 2010 Lauvergeon attended the Bilderberg conference in Sitges, Spain.By 2011, Lauvergeon came under fire due to cost overruns at the Areva-built Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant and the loss of a $40 billion contract in Abu Dhabi to a South Korean consortium. On 16 June 2011 Prime Minister François Fillon announced that her mandate as head of Areva, terminating end of June 2011, would not be renewed. She was replaced by Luc Oursel, member of the Areva board of management since 2007.Since leaving Areva, Lauvergeon has been a partner and managing director of Efficiency Capital, an investment firm that focuses on energy, technologies, and natural resources. She is also chairman and CEO of A.L.P. SAS, an advisory company. By 2016, media reported that President François Hollande had proposed Lauvergeon to take over as chair of the board at EADS and had won the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for her candidature.


=== Controversies ===
On 16 October 2009 Lauvergeon addressed journalists outside the ""Women’s Forum"" organised in Deauville. She declared: ""To be clear, with same competences, sorry, we will choose the woman or something else rather than the white male."" She said these words during the France 2 evening news. This statement generated reaction and was chosen as an example by Éric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen to explain that positive discrimination was a kind of racism.
In 2011, Lauvergeon filed a legal complaint after she discovered a confidential report by private investigators on her husband Olivier Fric's business activities. By 2012, she asked a French court to appoint an expert to examine the circumstances under which Areva ordered a probe in 2010 into the 2007 purchase of Canadian uranium mining firm UraMin; the request was subsequently denied. An internal audit into the deal did not reveal fraud, but said that presentations made to state holding company APE and to Areva's board about the planned UraMin acquisition had not given enough prominence to the doubts that the internal technical teams had expressed.Areva initially withheld Lauvergeon's 1.5 million euro ($2 million) severance pay due to the UraMin dispute. Also in 2012, a court ordered the company to sign a contract allowing Lauvergeon to receive her severance pay.Only 11 days before the first round of the 2012 French presidential election, Lauvergeon accused Sarkozy in an interview with French weekly L'Express of having tried to sell an atomic reactor to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi until mid-2010. In the interview, Lauvergeon also said Sarkozy had offered her a cabinet seat when he was elected in 2007 but she had refused. Sarkozy's spokeswoman Valérie Pécresse responded by accusing Lauvergeon of trying to ""settle scores"", calling her statements as ""fictitious"". At the time, Lauvergeon was tipped as a possible minister in a Socialist government under François Hollande.In 2016, Lauvergeon was put under formal investigation for her role in the UraMin acquisition, over questions on whether she deliberately submitted misleading annual accounts that concealed huge writedowns on its €1.8 billion investment in UraMin. Also, French judicial authorities investigated Fric for insider trading and money laundering over the UraMin purchase.

In 2014, Meyer sued the University of Oklahoma and the Fred Jones Jr. Museum for the return of a Camille Pissarro painting that had been looted by Nazis from her father, Raoul Meyer, in 1941 during the German occupation of France. The refusal of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum caused Oklahoma's Republican state representative Mike Reynolds to call on the American Association of Museums to review the museum's accredidation status for violating ethical bylaws.In 2016, after a long legal battle, during which the museum refused to restitute Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep (Bergère rentrant des moutons) by Camille Pissarro, Meyer arrived at a settlement with Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, and was able to bring the painting back to France.However the settlement specified that the painting not remain in France but, after five years, return to the United States and that the process of transferring the painting be repeated every three years in a kind of shared custody agreement. The painting, which had been displayed at Paris’ Musée d’Orsay since its return to France, was due to return to Oklahoma in 2021. In 2020 Meyers contested the agreement as unworkable, initiating a legal action in a French court. The Fred Jones Jr Museum sued Meyers, demanding that she be fined ""$3.5m in the US and face penalties of up to $100,000 a day for contempt of court if she does not halt proceedings in France in which she is seeking full ownership of the impressionist work"".On 1 June 2021, Meyer, who was 81 years old, abandoned the fight, relinquishing ownership of the Pissarro painting to the University of Oklahoma, stating, ""I have no other choice.

She enrolled in a DUT program in computer science to become a programmer analyst and in 1989, Newland passed her DUT in computer science at the IUT de Villetaneuse at the University of Paris-XIII.She was hired by a company that created analog and digital measurement systems. There she was introduced to the science of how physical phenomena could be transformed into electrical signals, including the collection, processing, restitution and analysis of data. To further explore the subject, she started on a work-study program to become an optronics engineer, which is a combination of optics, computer science and electronics. She enrolled at the Polytechnic School of Paris-Sud University in 1994 and finished her engineering degree in 1996 in optronics.After her employer's company was dissolved, Newland created her own firm in 2002 called NEW VISION Technologies, to specialize in optical measurement and control for both industrial and scientific projects. As the company's CEO, she guides applications that have ranged from optimizing the industrial cutting of salmon slices to monitoring the position of French RER rail lines.In an effort to encourage more women to pursue careers in science, Newland appears at schools to discuss her tasks as both an engineer and a company founder. In 2011, her advocacy work was featured in the SAN du Val Maubuée newspaper on the theme of women in business, which was the same subject for which she received an Irène-Joliot-Curie Prize in 2013.

38,"Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon (born September 17, 1962) is a French businesswoman and feminist. She was  CEO of the auFeminin.com group, from 2010 until April 2018. Aufeminin Group is the Europe's leading Internet portal dedicated to women's content. Le Figaro called her company number one in that category. She is considered by Dun and Bradstreet to be a major executive in Europe.She can be considered a proponent of third-wave feminism, due to her refusal to be ""locked in a binary world,"" her ""dynamic and combative"" personality, her publicly stated admiration of writer Fatou Diome, her work in marketing and selling by women and to women, her advocacy of human rights, especially against domestic violence, and her embrace of contradictions and conflict. She is frequently asked to comment publicly on issues of feminism and diversity.


== Education and early career ==
Sauty de Chalon had worked (as of 2004) for Le Monde, part of Publications de La Vie Catholique, a large media group.  Publishers Jean-Marie Colombani and Claude Perdriel selected her to lead their commercial division. Her selection was considered unusual, in part because of her master's degree in law at the French school Sciences-Po. Constance Benqué, president of Lagardere Active Publicité, called her dynamic and combative, in French, ""dynamique et combative"".Sauty de Chalon was appointed in December 2004 to lead the Carat France division of Aegis Media Europe, a large marketing and advertising firm. The parent company, Aegis Group plc, is a global marketing communications company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, is capitalized at c. £1.5 billion, and employs almost 16,800 staff in over 80 countries. She was quoted as saying that 2005 was both ""best year of my professional life"", and ""the worst year of my life"". In January 2006, she was appointed CEO of Aegis Media France.  In April 2009, Aegis Media replaced her, limiting her role to ""southern Europe and Belgium"".


== Current work ==
Sauty de Chalon hopes to gain revenue for auFeminin.com beyond advertising, to selling products online to women. She is expanding its already ""a rare example of a European Internet company that is a world leader in its field"". However, there are no plans to enter the American market yet, and will keep her ""French worldview"". For example, she is against ""absolute freedom of speech"", instead favoring ""human rights"".In an open letter to the Association européenne contre les Violences faites aux Femmes au Travail (AVTF), a feminist European organization against violence towards working women, she declared her hatred of domestic violence.  She wrote to them that:

my mission is to hunt down injustices against women in the exercise of my functions, as in the past in the media groups that I ran I always paid the greater attention to gender sensitivity and violence against women.... It is easy to cause a dismissal for failure to sexist remarks or behavior when you are an employer. We must indeed speak to the best companies on the subject. Aufeminin can be a forum on this topic.
In December 2010, she was a speaker at the ""Diversity management in Europe"" conference.

A member of the Socialist Party (PS), she was elected in a 6 June 2021 by-election following the resignation of George Pau-Langevin. On 28 January 2022, the Constitutional Council nullified her election, ruling it was held irregularly. The seat remained vacant until the June 2022 legislative election, in which El Aaraje competed again, but was defeated by Danielle Simonnet of La France Insoumise (FI).


== Education and professional life ==
Born in Rabat, El Aaraje arrived in Limoges, France in 2004 to study pharmacy. She holds a doctorate in pharmacy; in October 2013 she defended a thèse d'exercice on the ""Evolution of the concepts of public health and health education and the role of the School in their promotion"".At the same time, she completed her training by becoming a lawyer in health and drug law. Lamia El Aaraje began her professional career at the Haute Autorité de santé as an intern, before joining the parliamentary team of Haute-Garonne Socialist MP Catherine Lemorton, who presided over the Committee on Social Affairs in the 14th National Assembly. She subsequently worked as an executive in mutual health organisations (Mutuelle des Étudiants and Intériale Mutuelle).


== Political career ==
Joining the Socialist Party in the 2010s, Lamia El Aaraje became involved in various left-wing youth organisations during her university studies.

Her victory, in a constituency historically anchored on the left, marked the end of a campaign lasting several months due to the health crisis and the postponement of the election due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In January 2022 however, the Constitutional Council nullified her election and declared the seat vacant. One of the candidates in the 2021 by-election had ""fraudulently"" shown the support of La République En Marche! for his candidacy on the ballot.In the 2022 legislative election, El Aaraje declared she would run for a full term as the Socialist nominee in the 15th constituency, despite the New Ecological and Social People's Union (NUPES) coalition (of which the Socialist Party is part) deciding that La France Insoumise candidate Danielle Simonnet would be their joint candidate. While the NUPES described El Aaraje's candidacy as a ""dissident"" run, she was supported by former Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. She also benefited from the support of Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, whose policies she defends in the Council of Paris and whom she called to run for President of France in the 2022 presidential election. El Aaraje came a distant second place in the first round, before she faced Simonnet in the second round. She decisively lost the seat she had previously held.

58,"Fadela Amara (born Fatiha Amara on 25 April 1964) is a French feminist and politician, who began her political life as an advocate for women in the impoverished banlieues. She was the Secretary of State for Urban Policies in the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) government of French Prime Minister François Fillon. She is a former president of the organisation Ni Putes Ni Soumises.


== Biography ==
Amara was born to Algerian Berber Kabyle parents in an emergency housing district of Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dôme, which she later described as a shanty-town. The neighbourhood was mostly populated by immigrants from the Maghreb.  She was born into a family of eleven children, having four sisters and six brothers. Her father worked as a labourer during the week and in the markets on the weekend, while her mother was a housewife. Despite not being well off, Amara's father sent money back to his home village in Algeria and kept some more aside for the poor of the district. 
Regarding the situation there for women she said, ""daughters, sisters, cousins, female neighbours must either act like submissive but virtuous vassals, or be treated like cheap whores. Any sign of independence or femininity is viewed as a challenge and provocation."" Although she wished to study literature, she ended up taking a qualification as an office employee.
In 1978, when Amara was 14, her brother Malik was run down by a drunk driver. He died of his injuries after a few hours. Amara was appalled to see the police side with the driver at the scene of the incident.Amara participated in the first demonstration aimed at encouraging electoral registration among the young people of Clermont-Ferrand.  When she was 16 years old, the municipal authorities decided to demolish the district she lived in. She went from door to door canvassing support for its retention. At the age of 18, she established the Association des femmes pour l'échange intercommunautaire (Women's Association for Intercommunal Exchange), a fledgling example of Islamic feminism, with the aim of developing women's autonomy and individual thought through meetings between neighbouring communities.
In 1983 she took part in a mass demonstration of the Beurs (French of North African origin), and from 1986 on she was an activist within the civil rights organisation SOS Racisme. In 2000 she was elected president of the Fédération nationale des maisons des potes (FNMP). In 1989 she established the Women's Commission, whose principal objective was to investigate the position of women in urban and suburban areas and register the demands of those communities.
In March 2001 she was elected on the Socialist Party list at the municipal council of Clermont-Ferrand.
After the 2002 murder of 17-year-old Sohanne Benziane, she organised a march from the murder site beneath a banner declaring the women Ni Putes, Ni Soumises (neither whores, nor submissives). The motto stuck and became the name of the resulting organisation, of which she became the president.
In 2002 she organised a ""women's parliament"" in the Sorbonne with over 250 participants, drew up a petition which gained almost 20,000 signatures, and organised a nationwide tour of Ni Putes Ni Soumises, which finished in Paris on 8 March 2003.
On 19 June 2007, although still a member and a municipal councillor of the Socialist Party, she was appointed Secretary of State for Urban Policies in the 2nd UMP government of French Prime Minister François Fillon. She reported to Housing Minister Christine Boutin. She left the government in 2010, and was named France's inspector general for social affairs in January 2011.


== Secularism ==
André Gerin, who headed the commission to study the burqa, stated in an interview with The Economist, ""We will not accept that a particular religion: Islam or anything else, occupying the public space and dictating its rules over civil society. Thats what's happening with the fundamentalists...It goes against the entire history of Western Civilization."" President Nicolas Sarkozy, proposing the burqa legislation, was the first president to address the assembly since Napoleon Bonaparte. Bonaparte is considered to be one of the 'fathers' of french secularism but also allied the state with the Catholic Church and signed the Concordat of 1801. Kaminski, a member of the WSJ editorial board, stated, ""A state—a majority Christian state, to boot—is mandating how members of a minority religion should go about practising theirs.""The Guardian stated, ""This battle came to a head during the furore surrounding France's controversial 2004 law banning headscarves in schools. Amara's position was clear:,"" quoting Amara as stating, ""The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women,"" the article goes on to conclude, ""and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France's public school system."" The article and its conclusions were widely plagiarised by major news agencies but never verified for accuracy. The Atlantic claimed that Brian Grim had made exactly the same statements in a Pew Research Center report but he did not. It was plagiarized in a conference paper by a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Chenut's Forward to Fadela Amara's book cites Françoise Gaspard's work on the subject, ""Women's rights, she argues, are better served by not banning the headscarf. Expelling girls from French public schools deprives them of their right to education and of a path to modernity."" On page 94, Amara explains her reasoning for her opposition to the headscarf in public schools, that emancipated educated French Muslim women: 22–24  had apparently made the wrong choice, blaming the public school system for not teaching them to make the right choice, ""In the late 1980s...I was among those who said that these young women should not be excluded. Our reasoning was simple: these young women were under pressure from their families; to help them resolve it, it was preferable to keep them at school. We were counting on the republican school system, where they would learn to make their own choice and then to refuse the headscarf."" She goes on to argue that any attempt to ban the headscarf will be met with violent: 99  opposition, ""The effect will be the reverse of what we hoped for, the peaceful coexistence of different religions within a common secular framework."": 99  The Guardian's misinterpretation of her following statement is evident from the preceding quotations,  ""it is first of all a means of oppression, of alienation, of discrimination, an instrument of power over women used by men...We must tell young women that they can be Muslims today without wearing the headscarf."": 100   Amara's position was discussed in an English law school doctoral thesis with far greater attention to detail, confirming that Amara was against the ban.In 2013 she gave a speech at the University of Chicago in which she stated that she was in favour of a complete ban on the burqa before 2004. The English translator did not possess dual proficiency and misinterpreted most technical concepts. Amara claimed that Islamic fundamentalists paid women to wear veils to make it seem like it was more normal. She claims a vast conspiracy of ""Islamic fundamentalists"", ""trying to install islam everywhere, just like you've seen on the TV.""  She states that she respects women who choose to wear veils and that they should be allowed to wear them. She states that women should be free to choose to wear a veil.  She states that she would prefer legislation that protects women who wear the veil and for them to choose not to wear it, describing her opponents as fascists. This position was criticised on a french lawyers blog where he cited already enacted laws which provide this desired protection: Articles 222-18 and  Article 222-13, the author of the blog argues that the current laws are already effective but that the burqa ban would be inadequate to protect women from domestic violence. Amara, in the Chicago speech, criticised the Levy sisters, who wore hijab not burqa, for ""flaunting"" the french principle of secularism and blamed all instances of girls wearing veils to school on the sisters. Amara's position was very unclear as she both advocated for an act that strictly prohibited the practice under penalty of law and for women to maintain the freedom to choose.
In 2009, the day after the commission into the burqa was tabled in the National Assembly, Amara showed her support for the parliamentary commission to investigate the burqa

""I am in favour of a complete prohibition of the burqa throughout the country. I want it to be banned, this coffin of fundamental freedoms. I want a debate that leads to a law that protects women.""

The commissioners bragged about interviewing 200 people but didn't interview any women who wear full veils regularly so it has been suggested that it was a waste of six months. Only two sociologists turned up in niqabs and later went on to fight an international human rights case on the subject. The laws passed by the National Assembly were what Amara had warned about in her 2004 book. Instead of a complete ban, it was only banned in public further serving to marginalise women and it was probably illegal to make up those laws anyway. Some people said the whole thing was pretty dumb to argue about.
