4,"Regine Hildebrandt (née Radischewski; 26 April 1941 – 26 November 2001) was a German biologist and politician (Social Democratic Party of Germany).


== Life ==


=== Early years ===


==== Wartime in Germany ====
Regine Radischewski was born in Berlin during the war, the second of her parents' two recorded children. Her father was a pianist who worked as an accompanist at the National Ballet Academy.Her mother would later own a small tobacconist shop. When she was two the family were evacuated from central Berlin to countryside far to the east of Germany, and shortly after that they were bombed out, losing most of their material possessions.


==== Growing up ====
The war ended in May 1945 and the family ended up back in Berlin.   For the first five or six years of her schooling she attended a school in a western occupation zone of the city (""West Berlin""), but as the political division between the Soviet occupation zone and the western occupation zones became more stark and, it seemed, more permanent, her parents opted on her behalf for a school in the Soviet zone in what had by now become known as East Berlin.   The family home was in the city centre along Bernauer Straße (""Bernau Street"") which formed the (initially hard to spot) political border between East Berlin and West Berlin, and afforded Regine a ring-side seat in the cold wall drama until September 1961 when the family were forcibly relocated in connection with the building of the Berlin Wall.  In October 1961 she co-founded and joined the interdenominational choir at Berlin's (Protestant) Cathedral, which now flourished under the musical direction of a man called Herbert Hildebrand.


=== Middle years ===


==== The student ====
From 1959 to 1964, she studied  biology at the Humboldt University in East Berlin.She had never joined the Free German Youth (FDJ/Freie Deutsche Jugend), which was in effect the youth wing of the young country's ruling SED party. Her failure to join seems to have been a result of timetable clashes involving her commitment to singing in the church choir. Failure to enroll in the FDJ had nevertheless led to her application for the university course to be initially rejected; and subsequent failure as an adult to become a Party Member would constrain her career opportunities right up until 1989.


==== A career in research ====
Between 1964 and 1978 Regine Radischewski worked in a management position involving Quality Control in the pharmacology department of VEB Berlin-Chemie, a major conglomerate in East Berlin. Hildebrandt combined her responsibilities in the pharmaceuticals department with a medicines research project at the Humboldt University which led to her receiving her doctorate in 1978.  In 1978 she took a senior research position at Berlin's Centre for the Study of Metabolism Illnesses and Diabetes, heading up the Diabetes department until 1990. During this period she had numerous research papers published.


==== Family matters ====
During these years she also found time, in 1966 to marry Jörg Hildebrandt, brother of the musical director of the choir in which they sang.   The two had known each other through the church since 1950:  they had also been near neighbours, with a shared childhood experience of living along the East–West front-line before 1961.  The marriage produced three children, born in 1969, 1971 and 1974.   Her research career left her with enough space to devote time to the family, which was very important to her.   Her husband later recalled that they ate together each evening six days per week, and on Sundays had a family lunch in the middle of the day after getting back from church.   When she died, aged 60, she would still be living with younger family members in a large ""multi-generational family house"" they had been able to have built after 1990.


==== Interaction with the state ====
The family participated the political life of the  one-party dictatorship only when they felt they had to. They did not vote in the country's sham elections because §22 of the constitution did not oblige them to vote (although the 1986 General election resulted, typically, in a reported turnout of 99.74%).   Regine Hildebrand did join the national Trade Union Federation (FDGB/Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund) because not to have done so would have deprived her research colleagues of vital funding.   When fraternal tanks appeared on the streets of Prague to crush political reform, the Hildebrandts joined in a protest demonstration outside the Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin.
They would write letters of protest to the Party Central Committee and to Neues Deutschland, the party's mass-circulation official daily newspaper. Hildebrand assiduously read Neues Deutschland and followed other official media, if only to keep herself up to date with The Party's politically correct linguistic contrivances of the moment.  The family never owned a television set, but news came from radio programmes broadcast from West Berlin or London, and from friends who visited from the west and were permitted (unlike East German citizens) to return to the west afterwards.


=== Politics ===
The summer of 1989 brought a dramatic change in her life when she, together with her husband, Jörg, was among the co-founders of Democracy Now, which sought an alliance of Christians and critical Marxists ""to think about our future, to think about a society based on solidarity"".


==== The Social Democrats ====
On 12 October 1989 she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which (in East Germany) had been re-founded five days earlier.   The Hildebrandts valued the embracing compassionate socialism of the moderate left which had been nurtured and demonstrated by iconic (western) SPD figures from the recent past such as Kurt Schumacher and Willy Brandt.   A year later, following reunification, in October 1990 the party would merge formally with the West German Social Democratic Party (SDP).


==== National ministerial office ====
1990 was the year in which, for rather less than a year, she became an important Social Democratic participant in the national politics of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).   National elections in the GDR had traditionally operated according to a single list system which offered the voters only one list of (carefully preselected) candidates.  Anyone wishing to vote against the list could do so by placing the ballot paper in a separate ballot box while the officials looked on:  few did.   But on 18 March 1990 the German Democratic Republic conducted its first (and as matters turned out, last) democratically configured general election.  The Social Democrats took 21.9% of the vote which entitled them to 88 seats in the country's first freely elected National legislative assembly (Volkskammer). One of the seats went to Hildebrand, representing the Berlin electoral district. She also joined the coalition government of Lothar de Maizière, serving between April and August 1990 as the East German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs.A political decision had been taken to convert East German currency into western Marks at a one-for one rate (except in respect of very large amounts), and Hildebrandt's priority as a government minister was tackling growing unemployment in east Germany, following economic disruption associated with the ongoing reunification process.The governing coalition started to splinter in August 1990 leading to the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from it, as a result of which Regine Hildebrandt terminated her career as a government minister at the national level. The next month, however, in 1990 she was elected to the national committee of the SPD (for the whole of Germany, even though national reunification would not be formally enacted until October).


==== Minister in Brandenburg ====
Hildebrandt now became a key SPD figure in the state politics of Brandenburg. In October 1990, the state tier of government was reintroduced to what had been the German Democratic Republic, and as part of the process elections took place for a new state parliament in Brandenburg on 26 October. Hildebrandt was elected as an SPD member and then appointed to ministerial office under minister-president Manfred Stolpe: from 1 November 1990 onwards she served as Brandenburg's Minister for Labour, Social affairs, Health and Women, in effect an expanded version of the ministerial portfolio she had been handling nationally earlier in the year.She was a popular and effective minister, often hitting the headlines with less than diplomatic outbursts, always charmingly reasonable but also forcefully persuasive with key colleagues when, as often happened, issues within her ministerial ambit came down to arguments about funding. In the popular media she frequently attracted the soubriquet ""Mother Courage"".In the 1999 Brandenburg state election the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority and minister-president Manfred Stolpe prepared to form a ""grand coalition"" with the centre-right CDU party. Hildebrand was already seriously ill and had strongly campaigned for an alternative alliance, with the left-wing PDS. She resigned from the state government.The Hildebrandts and the state prime minister Manfred Stolpe had known one another since the 1960s through their church connections, though they had not been aware at every level of Stolpe's complicated and possibly at times collaborative relationship with the Ministry for State Security during the years of the dictatorship. After her resignation from the government Hildebrand and Stolpe would continue to treasure one another's friendship, and remain political allies, until Hildebrandt's death in 2001.Nationally in December 1999 and again in November 2001, a few weeks before she died, Hildebrand topped the polls in the elections to the national executive of the Social Democratic Party.


== Death ==
In July 1996 it became known that Regine Hildebrandt had breast cancer. She died at age 60 on 26 November 2001 in Woltersdorf, Brandenburg.


== Honours and awards ==
1993: Gustav Heinemann Citizenship Prize
1993: Hamm Brücher Medal
1997: ""Golden Hen""
2000: Fritz Bauer Prize
2001: Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany

At a party conference on 12 December, Jarasch was formally elected as the top candidate, receiving 142 votes in favour, none against, and five abstentions.Jarasch declared that she sought to make the Greens the biggest party in the Abgeordnetenhaus, and to become the first Green Governing Mayor of Berlin.

She was co-lead candidate in the 2016 Berlin state election alongside Ramona Pop, Bettina Jarasch, and Daniel Wesener.


== Early life and education ==

She is the daughter of Frank Kapek, a former Green politician who served as member of the Abgeordnetenhaus from 1987 to 1989. After graduating from the Robert Blum Gymnasium in Schöneberg, she studied geography with minors in law, transportation planning, and environmental management at the Free University of Berlin, the Technical University of Berlin, and the Humboldt University of Berlin.

Kapek was also a scholarship holder of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation. From 2007 to 2011, she was a research assistant to Michael Cramer, Member of the European Parliament. Kapek is married and mother to two children, and lives with her family in Kreuzberg.


== Political career ==


=== Career in state politics ===
Kapek has been a member of the Alliance 90/The Greens since 2005. She was compelled to enter politics after living and studying in the Netherlands in the early 2000s, during which time she witnessed the conservative shift in society which followed the assassination of Pim Fortuyn. From 2006 to 2011, she was a member of the municipal council of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. From 2008, she was co-chair of the Greens faction there alongside Daniel Wesener. She was also spokeswoman for urban development, environment, and transport policy.
Kapek was elected to the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin in the 2011 Berlin state election via the state list, on which she was placed third. She became spokeswoman for urban development policy and, from November, deputy chair of the Greens faction. On 30 October 2012, she became co-leader of the parliamentary group, alongside Ramona Pop.In October 2015, Kapek was nominated as part of a four-member team of lead candidates for the 2016 Berlin state election alongside Bettina Jarasch, Ramona Pop, and Daniel Wesener. Kapek was placed second on the state-wide party list, and was elected to the Abgeordnetenhaus. She also ran in the constituency Lichtenberg 4, winning 10.0% of votes. Post-election, she was a member of the main negotiating group which led the formation of the red–red–green government. In December, she was re-elected as parliamentary group leader; Silke Gebel succeeded Ramona Pop as her counterpart.In April 2021, she was again elected to second place on the Greens state list for the 2021 Berlin state election. She was re-elected as both member of the Abgeordnetenhaus and subsequently as co-leader of the Greens faction.On 22 February 2022, Kapek unexpectedly announced that she would resign as leader, citing mental and physical exhaustion from political work. She was succeeded by Werner Graf on 15 March.


=== Role in national politics ===
Kapek was nominated by her party as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017 and 2022.


== Political positions ==
Kapek is considered a representative of the left-wing of the Greens. She advocates political transparency, citizen participation, the preservation of public spaces, and social and cultural diversity. She supports  citizens' petitions and advocates the integration of social housing in new construction projects.


=== Transportation ===
Kapek believes that a major turnaround is needed in transportation in Berlin. She described the mobility law of the second Müller senate as a ""law for the most vulnerable road users"", such as children and the elderly. She advocates a ""fairer distribution"" of road space in Berlin, making it more accessible to the public, and improving traffic safety through stricter speed limits, increased traffic control, more speed cameras, and higher fines.In 2017, Kapek proposed the introduction of a fare-free student ticket for public transit, stating this would ease the burden for ""very, very many Berlin families"". This was passed by the state government on 2018 and introduced in 2019. She also called for a new funding model to expand public transport and close gaps in the existing network, suggesting the introduction of a general ""citizen ticket"" paid by all Berliners, and potentially a congestion charge.


=== Urban development ===
Kapek advocates socially responsible urban development that makes the preservation of ""Berlin's lively blend of people, architecture, art, and culture"" the basis of future policy. She views public participation as a key tool to involve people in the process of change, and for avoiding conflicts over the development of neighbourhoods.She also calls for the purchase of ""citywide areas for green development"" and for more resources to be spent on the maintenance and preservation of urban green spaces. In her view, green spaces are ""systemically relevant,"" which became even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.In response to the state of the Berlin housing market, Kapek has called for tightening of tenancy laws and expansion of tenant protection. She described housing policy as ""the social issue of the next decade"", and that it was essential to ensure that Berlin remained affordable for all.


=== Tempelhofer Feld ===
Kapek has repeatedly spoken out against building on the edges of Tempelhofer Feld, and defended the results of the referendum on the area, which saw 64% of voters support restricting development in the park. She states that thought should be given to preserving green spaces as places of recreation rather than construction. Kapek advocates further developing Tempelhofer Feld as a ""Central Park"", and has repeatedly suggested that a swimming lake be created in its centre.

In July 2003, she became co-deputy leader of the PDS, focusing on the party's social agenda and contact with social movements.Kipping was a chief representative of the young progressive generation who sought to renew the party and place emphasis on environmentalism, social justice, and social movements. She was a principal proponent of a united left party, comprising the east-oriented PDS and the west-oriented Labour and Social Justice (WASG). The two parties formed a joint list for the 2005 federal election, and Kipping was elected to the Bundestag as a representative for Saxony. The PDS and WASG merged to form The Left in June 2007, and Kipping was elected deputy chairperson of the new party. She was re-elected to the Bundestag in 2009 and became chairwoman of the Committee for Labour and Social Affairs.In May 2009, she co-founded the Emancipatory Left, a libertarian socialist faction within The Left, alongside Caren Lay and Julia Bonk. The previous year, Kipping had become editor of the left-wing magazine Prague Spring, which became the faction's primary publication.
In January 2012, Der Spiegel reported that Kipping was one of 27 members of The Left's parliamentary group who were under surveillance by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz).


=== Federal co-leader ===
On 2 June 2012, Kipping was elected as one of The Left's two chairpersons, winning 67% of votes at the federal party congress. Her counterpart was Bernd Riexinger.
In the Bundestag, Kipping was The Left's spokesperson for social affairs and a strong opponent of the Hartz IV program. She has long advocated its repeal and the implementation of universal basic income; she was spokeswoman for the Basic Income Network from 2004 to 2008. She also calls for the reduction of the work week from five days to four. From November 2009 to September 2012, she chaired the Bundestag's Committee on Labour and Social Affairs.
During the European refugee crisis, Kipping supported the federal government's decision to keep the borders open for refugees. She advocated for reform of immigration law to permit quicker and easier naturalisation, and for a ""new social contract"" to facilitate easier movement, guarantees of individual rights and social security for all.
In her book New Left Majorities: An Invitation, Kipping calls for an economic realignment towards what she terms the ""economy of commons"", which would prioritise the interests of the citizens over profits. She advocates for reintroducing the concept of the commons, particularly in digital technology, enabling people to work cooperatively for the common good, and allowing increased productivity to ease the burden on workers. The second pillar is ""infrastructure socialism"", whereby fulfilling the needs of the population would be a key focus of both national and local decision-making. Access to healthcare, housing, and transportation would be guaranteed, among other things.
Kipping has repeatedly spoken in favour of The Left's involvement in government with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Greens. In a March 2019 article published in Die Welt, she called for the centre-left parties to join The Left in a coalition committed to socio-economic reform away from what she described as a neoliberal consensus exemplified by the Agenda 2010. She pointed to the Berlin government's attitude toward the city's housing crisis as an example to follow, and praised the initiative for a referendum to expropriate large real estate companies. Noting the popularity of right-wing protest parties alongside broad support for progressive social and ecological policies, Kipping suggested that voters are dissatisfied with an insufficiently ambitious left. In her view, a left-wing majority could be achieved through a bold platform committed to social and economic transformation.In Bundestag elections, Kipping served as The Left's candidate in Dresden I in elections from 2005 to 2021, placing either second or third each time. Her best performance was 25.0% in the 2013 election. In the 2017 election, Kipping placed third with 21.0% behind AfD candidate Jens Maier (22.4%) and CDU incumbent Andreas Lämmel (24.6%). In 2021, in light of Lämmel's retirement and the declining popularity of the CDU, Kipping campaigned for SPD and Greens supporters to tactically support her candidacy to prevent Maier from winning. She was backed by the Campact movement. The CDU ultimately held the seat with their candidate Markus Reichel, who won 21.1% of votes. Kipping placed second on 18.9%, 92 votes ahead of Maier (18.8%). Despite the loss, Kipping was optimistic about her performance compared to The Left's overall popularity; the party list received only 10.5% in the constituency. The close result also made the seat a potential target for The Left in future elections given their narrow margin of entry into the Bundestag.In August 2020, Kipping and Riexinger announced they would step down as co-chairs in accordance with party regulations stating that no position should be held by the same person for more than eight years. The party congress due to elect their successors was scheduled for October/November 2020, but was delayed due to the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. It ultimately took place digitally in February 2021. Kipping, as the designated female co-chair, was succeeded by Janine Wissler; Riexinger was succeeded by Susanne Hennig-Wellsow.


=== Senator of Berlin ===
On 2 December 2021, during the government formation following the 2021 Berlin state election, the Berlin association of The Left announced that Katja Kipping would replace fellow Left politician Elke Breitenbach as Senator for Integration, Labour, and Social Affairs in the Giffey senate. She was sworn in on 21 December 2021 and served until the Giffey senate left office on 27 April 2023 after the 2023 Berlin repeat state election.


== Social affiliations ==
In December 2007, Kipping joined members of the Bundestag and Saxon Landtag for a demonstration in support of Rote Hilfe e. V. (Red Aid), a far-left prisoner support group. Kipping left Rote Hilfe in March 2009.
Kipping is a founding member and board member of the Institute of Solidary Modernity, a left-wing oriented think tank founded in 2010.

39,"Birgit Klaubert (born 28 September 1954) is a German politician (Die Linke) and former vice president of the Thuringian regional parliament (""Landtag""). From 2014 to 2017 Klaubert served as Thuringia's Minister for Education, Youth and Sport.


== Life ==


=== Provenance and early years ===
Birgit Klaubert was born in Schöneck, a small town in the mountains to the east of Plauen in East Germany, and close to the country's frontier with the westernmost extent of Czechoslovakia. She attended school locally in Klingenthal, where passing her school final exams (""Abitur"") opened the way to university level education. Between 1973 and 1977 she studied and qualified for a degree as a teacher of History and German at the Karl Marx University of Leipzig (as it was known at that time).   Between 1977 and 1980 she worked as a teacher at the secondary school (""Polytechnische Oberschule"") in Altenburg. After that, till 1983, she worked at Altenburg's teacher training institute.Between 1983 and 1986 she undertook a further period of study as an ""Aspirantur"" in the history department at the ""Clara Zetkin"" teacher training college in Leipzig. This led to a doctorate. Her dissertation was entitled ""The struggle of Germany's free trades unions to organise women workers between 1896 and the outbreak of the Forst World War"" (""Das Ringen der freien Gewerkschaften Deutschlands um die Organisierung der Arbeiterinnen von 1896 bis zum Ausbruch des 1. Weltkrieges"").   After this she returned to teaching work at the teacher training institute in Altenburg, where she remained till 1994 when her political involvement translated into a full-time job and a seat in the Thuringian regional parliament (""Landtag"").


=== Politics ===
While growing she was, like almost all her contemporaries a member of the country's youth organisations, the Free German Youth (""Freie Deutsche Jugend"" / FDJ) and the Pioneers.  Birgit Klaubert was a candidate for membership of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (""Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"" / SED) and the next year, which was the year of her twentieth birthday, she was accepted as a party member. Most sources are silent on her political involvement before 1989:  a biographical note provided by the party of which she is now a member indicates that her political involvement included conducting classes and seminars for groups of children and trades unionists. The same source spells out that she never collaborated with the infamous Ministry for State Security (""Stasi"").Following reunification she became more politically involved. The old SED which had ruled in East Germany relaunched itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), and set about adapting itself for a democratic future. Following further political realignments the party merged into a new party, called simply The Left (""Die Linke"") in 2007. Throughout this period, initially at a municipal level and later on the regional stage, Birgit Klaubert remained active as a member of the party through its ups and downs.   She was elected to the Altenburg town council in 1990.In 1994 she was elected to the Thuringian regional parliament (""Landtag""). Between 13 December 1995 and 12 September 1999, in succession to Ursula Fischer, she led the PDS group in the chamber.   The focus of her own interests in the chamber was on ""culture"", as broadly defined. She was deeply interested in education and training matters.   In 1999 she was elected one of the two vice-presidents of the Thuringian Landtag, regularly re-elected to the post till 2014.In 2013 the regional party executive proposed Klaubert as the party's lead candidate for Thuringia in the forthcoming general election. The nomination was supported by the local party committees, and on 2 March 2013 at meeting held at Friedrichroda party delegates voted on the matter. However, when the votes were counted Klaubert was found to have received only 59 of the 120 delegates' votes. Faced with this underwhelming endorsement she withdrew her candidacy. Commentators speculated that the unexpected outcome of the vote reflected general disenchantment with the local party executive rather than hitherto unidentified issues over Klaubert's own candidacy.   After being appointed regional Minister for Education, Youth and Sport in the Ramelow Cabinet she took the opportunity - like Bodo Ramelow himself - to resign her seat in the Landtag.Klaubert announced her resignation due to illness on July 4, 2017. She was succeeded by Helmut Holter in August 2017.


== Beyond politics ==
Birgit Klaubert is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Regional Centre for Political Education and a member of the REgional Memorials Council. She is also an honorary (unpaid) member of the Supervisory Board of the Altenburg-Gera theatre company.

In 2002, Klöckner became a member of the Regional Committee on Security Policy and the Armed Forces and the JU Regional Executive of Rhineland-Palatinate, where she stayed until 2007.


=== Member of the Bundestag, 2002–2011 ===
First term, 2002–2005
In October 2002, following the German federal election that year, Klöckner entered the German parliament, the Bundestag, via the Rhineland-Palatinate list of state candidates, having scored 7% less than her SPD rival Fritz-Rudolf Körper in the first round of voting.
On 14 November 2002 Klöckner was elected as one of the secretaries of the Bundestag's plenary sessions. In addition she joined the board of trustees of the Federal Agency for Civic Education.

On 23 October 2007 Klöckner was unanimously voted as deputy chairwoman and thus as chairwoman of the working group for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. She was part of this working group until 2009.In July 2008 Klöckner began a two-year stint as chairwoman of the newly constituted consumer advisory body of Schufa established to represent the interests of consumer protection.
In the 2009 federal elections Klöckner was confirmed as the directly elected member of parliament for the constituency of Kreuznach/Birkenfeld with 47.0% of first votes and an 18% lead over her SPD rival. In the negotiations to form a coalition government of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), she was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on environment, agriculture and consumer protection policies, led by Ilse Aigner and Michael Kauch.
After the constitution of the Rhineland-Palatinate parliament on 18 May 2011, Klöckner resigned her seat in the Bundestag on 27 May 2011.


=== Parliamentary State Secretary ===
On 29 October 2009, Klöckner was appointed as a Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture under Minister Ilse Aigner. In February 2011 she resigned from this office in order to run the CDU in Rhineland-Palatinate. Her successor in this office is Peter Bleser (CDU).


=== State politics in Rhineland-Palatinate ===
Within the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU, Klöckner moved up to the party's state executive committee in 2003. On 13 June 2004 Julia Klöckner was elected to the county council (Kreistag) of Bad Kreuznach with 42,888 votes, the highest number of votes of the 50 CDU candidates. In the next council elections on 7 June 2009 she was again elected with the most votes (this time 46,759 votes).On 8 July 2006 Klöckner was elected as Deputy State Chairwoman of the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU with 91.5% of the vote on the CDU Party's 59th Regional Day.On 17 November 2009, Klöckner was proposed by the CDU chairman for Rhineland-Palatinate, Christian Baldauf, as the lead candidate for the 2011 state elections. On 17 April 2010 she was duly elected as the CDU's front runner at the CDU state party conference in Bingen am Rhein with 400 out of 402 votes cast (99.5%). On 25 September 2010 at the state party conference in Mainz, she was elected as leader of the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU with 96.9% of the vote. On 4 December 2010 she achieved first place in the state list for the 2011 elections at the party conference of the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU Association in Ramstein-Miesenbach, gaining 99.6% of the votes.In the state elections on 27 March 2011, voters gave Klöckner the direct mandate for the constituency of Bad Kreuznach with 44.4% of the votes. After scoring their lowest result in the 2006 elections with only 32.8% of the vote, the CDU's performance state level was 2.5% higher than the national trend and just 0.5% behind the SDP, who suffered a historic loss of 9.9% of the vote.
Following the state elections, Klöckner was unanimously elected as the CDU's party leader in the Rhineland-Palatinate parliament on 30 March 2011.In the 2016 state elections, Klöckner again ran for the office of Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate. With the European migrant crisis emerging as the dominating campaign issue, Klöckner responded by trying to harden her line on migrants while carefully avoiding any whiff of disloyalty to Chancellor Angela Merkel. In a joint statement with CDU Baden-Württemberg leading candidate Guido Wolf Klöckner proposed in February 2016 flexible daily quotas for refugee inflows into Germany, which was a step beyond Merkel's “open-doors” policy but not so far as the CSU, the CDU's Bavaria-based sister party, which backed fixed annual limits. No one should be allowed to enter Germany without a reason for asylum or a protection status. She eventually lost against incumbent Malu Dreyer.


=== Role in national politics ===
In 2003, Klöckner was elected to the federal board of the Frauen Union, a national organization for CDU women. In addition she became a deputy member in the board of the European People's Party. On 14 May 2007 she became the deputy chairwoman of the CDU Commission on the ""Preservation of the Creation: Climatic, Environmental and Consumer Protection"", where she led the Sub-Commission on Consumer Protection.
At the 23rd national CDU party conference on 15 November 2010, Klöckner became a member of the CDU Präsidium or steering committee with 94.43% of the votes, the highest number of votes out of all 40 candidates. On 4 December 2012 she was elected as one of five deputy chairpersons of the national CDU party with 92.92% of the votes (once again the best result), serving alongside Volker Bouffier, Armin Laschet, Thomas Strobl and Ursula von der Leyen.
Following the 2013 federal elections, Klöckner was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement for the third government of Chancellor Angela Merkel. By 2016, she was widely seen by commentators as having quietly positioned herself as a leading candidate to replace Merkel.

== Political positions ==


=== Social policy ===
Klöckner is a declared opponent of abortion and also favours a ban on stem cell research.Klöckner herself has benefited from a CDU gender quorum introduced in 1996,  as it provided her a good position on the party's candidate list in for the 2002 federal elections. Without the quota, Klöckner has acknowledged in the past, she would not have made it as far within her party. In 2013, she demanded a legally enforced quota calling on publicly traded companies to have women hold a minimum of 30 percent of the seats on their supervisory boards, starting in 2020.


=== Human rights ===
In May 2014, Klöckner urged Turks living in Germany to boycott a speech by Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan, as a protest against his government's crackdown on protests that followed the Soma mine disaster, which had killed 301 people.When news media in 2014 revealed images purporting to show security guards abusing asylum seekers at a shelter in western Germany, Klöckner said the incident should prompt a review of the country's refugee policy and infrastructure. She also called for Germany to support Italy, Greece, and Turkey in processing asylum applications at registration centres there.In late 2014, Klöckner spoke out in favour of banning the burka, arguing that the German constitution emphasized that women and men were of equal value and that ""looking at people's faces"" also belonged to the culture of an open society. In 2019, Klöckner repeated her calls for banning the burka.


=== Foreign policy ===
Speaking on the bilateral relations between Germany and Israel in 2013, Klöckner held that while ""Germany has a historical responsibility,"" this should not be understood as ""a blank check to be uncritical in foreign policy.""


== Controversies ==


=== 2009 presidential election tweet ===
During the German presidential election, Klöckner prematurely reported on Twitter the results of the vote by the Federal Assembly from the official electoral polling commission (Zählkommission). About 15 minutes before the official announcement of the election result, she tweeted a reference to the last day of the German football premier league season:  #Bundesversammlung Leute, Ihr könnt in Ruhe Fußball gucke. Wahlgang hat geklappt! (""Federal assembly, people, you can watch football in peace. Election a success!""). Other members of parliament also announced the result via SMS and Twitter prematurely, but justified themselves later, by arguing that they had not participated in the vote counting.
Following criticism of her premature announcement of the result, Klöckner resigned from her post as secretary to the Bundestag.


=== 2019 lobbying accusations ===
In June 2019, Klöckner received criticism over a video that could be interpreted as an ""advertisement for Swiss food conglomerate Nestlé"". In the clip, Klöckner congratulates Nestle Germany leader Marc-Aurel Boersch for Nestlé's contributions in the wider context of a nation-wide initiative for voluntarily commitments of the food industry to reduce fat, sugar and salt in their products.

46,"Heidi Knake-Werner is a German politician (Die Linke).   She served as a member of the German parliament (""Bundestag"") between 1994 and 2002.   Between 2002 and 2009 she was one of Berlin's more high-profile senators.


== Life ==


=== Provenance and early years ===
Heidi Knake was born in Tomaschow (as it was known at that time), a midsized industrial town to the south-west of Warsaw which had been in Congress Poland before the First World War, in Poland subsequently, and since 1939 part of Nazi Germany.   However, by the time she was 2 extensive ethnic cleansing in what had again become Poland in 1945 had already removed most of the German-speaking population, and she grew up in Wilhelmshaven on Germany's north-western coast.   Knake passed her Abitur (school final exams) in 1964 which opened the way to university-level education.   She then progressed to the University of Göttingen, emerging in 1969 with a degree in Social Economics.   There followed a period of post-graduate research and study at Oldenburg.   It was from the university at Oldenburg that in 1978 she received her doctorate in Social Sciences, and where till 1987 she stayed on as a researcher into topics such as family, education and industrial sociology.   That year she switched to the University of Bremen.


=== Communist ===
Heike Knake became a DGB (trades union) member in 1969, and has been a member of a succession of unions subsequently.   She joined the Social Democratic Party (""Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / SPD) in 1970, and became increasingly engaged politically, both within the party and in local politics more generally, serving for four years as a municipal councillor in Oldenburg.   For some of this time she was the deputy leader of the SPD group on the council.   However, at the height of the ructions over professional blocks for members of extremist political parties, in 1981 she resigned from the SPD and joined the German Communist Party.   This came directly after the increasingly ""moderate"" SPD party executive had launched its own ""party operation"" (""Parteiordnungsverfahren"") against the ""renitente Linke"" (loosely ""reluctant left"").   She remained a Communist Party member till 1989.

The German Communist Party never gained electoral traction with West German voters, partly because of a widespread belief that across the ""inner border"" in East Germany the supposedly pro-communist ruling party was principally a tool of Soviet imperial expansionist ambitions.   Sources are almost entirely silent about Heidi Knake-Werner's nine years as a member of the German Communist Party.   In 1990 she changed her political allegiance again, joining the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), recently relaunched as a successor to the old East German Socialist Unity Party, as younger members of what had till recently been East Germany's ruling political establishment struggled to prepare for a democratic future, following the changes of 1989/90.  Reunification took place suddenly, formally, in October 1990, and during the rest of that year it was still unusual for a western politician to join the PDS:  most of the relatively small number who did so came not from the West German Communist Party but from the SPD.   Her own transition gave Knake-Werner a reputation as a political maverick which she has subsequently seemed to relish.


=== Party of Democratic Socialism ===
At the second party conference of the PDS, held in Berlin on 26/27 January 1991, she was elected a member of the party executive, and was also one of just four PDS members from former West Germany to be voted onto the party presidium.   Later that year she accepted an offer from the youthful PDS Bundestag member, Petra Bläss to work as a parliamentary researcher for the PDS group in the Bundestag.   For Heidi Knake-Werner it was the start of a Bundestag career that would last for more than a decade.    In 1994 Knake-Werner herself was elected to the Bundestag.  She stood as a list-candidate from the ""Aschersleben–Bernburg–Quedlinburg"" electoral district where the party failed to clear the 5% hurdle necessary to send members to the Bundestag.   However, in the recently re-established state of Saxony-Anhalt, the PDS received 18% of the total vote and was thereby entitled to nominate 4 additional members:  Heidi Knake-Werner was one of those nominated.


=== Bundestag ===
During the 1994-1998 parliamentary session Knake-Werner was a deputy chairperson of the PDS parliamentary group, under the leadership of Gregor Gysi.   In the Bundestag she took on responsibility for her party's ""Labour market and social policy"" portfolio.   She also represented the PDS position to the parliamentary committee for ""Labour and Social Affairs"" and on the parliamentary ""Health committee"".   That reflected several of the areas on which she had already focused while working before 1994 as a parliamentary researcher for Petra Bläss.   Other themes in which she took a particular interest included pensions policy, family matters and gender equality, both in the workplace and more widely.   She also engaged with more overtly feminist agenda issues such as the ongoing debates about abortion legislation, an issue on respect of which the country had inherited more conventionally ""liberal"" laws from communist East Germany than from capitalist West Germany.   The carefully detailed nature of her numerous annotation included in party archives make it clear that she contributed extensively to the content and coherence of the party's position papers on many of these topics.   During the 1994-1998 Bundestag session Heidi Knake-Werner was the author or co-author of 3 draft laws, 18 parliamentary motions, 3 motions for resolution, and 30 amendments as well as of 4 major question applications and 67 minor question applications.   She delivered 56 speeches in plenary parliamentary sessions and issued 135 press statements.   She was also a member of the PDS parliamentary delegation that took part in the Fourth International United Nations Women's Forum held in Beijing during the first part of September 1995.In the 1998 General election Knake-Werner was re-elected.   The PDS increased its share of the national vote from 4.4% to 5.1%.   Breaking through to 5% hurdle significantly increased the party's strength in the Bundestag, notably in respect of appointments to parliamentary committees.  In addition, for the first time the PDS was able to nominate a member to the Bundestag presidium.   During the parliamentary session, till 2002, Knake-Werner served as a member of the executive of the PDS parliamentary group, and till October 2000 she was also deputy leader of the PDS Bundstag group.  Then, as part of a general shake-up at the top of the parliamentary party that accompanied the unexpected resignation from the leadership of Gregor Gysi, in October 2000 she was, some felt, demoted when she became the parliamentary group's ""First Parliamentary Business Leader"" (""Erste Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin""), remaining in post till January 2002.   The PDS group were now able to send her as a full member to the Bundestag committee for ""Labour and Social Affairs"", of which till October 2000 she served as a deputy chairwoman.   In respect of the deputy chairmanship role she was replaced when she became ""First Parliamentary Business Leader"" of the PDS, but she continued to play her part as the PDS member of the committee.Separately, by 2002 she was serving as honorary chairwomen of the German-Portuguese parliamentary group.   On 17 February 2002 Heidi Knake-Werner resigned from the Bundestag in order to take up new duties as a Berlin senator.   Her successor in the Bundestag was Wolfgang Bierstedt.


=== Berlin senate ===
Between 17 January 2002 and November 2006 Heid Knake-Werner served as the Berlin senator for Health, Social affairs and Consumer protection.   She switched portfolios on 23 November 2006, becoming the senator for Integration, Labour and Social affairs.   In the Berlin election of September 2006 she was elected a member of the City Parliament (""Abgeordnetenhaus""), but half a year later she withdrew from the chamber in order to be able to focus on her ministerial duties.   Then, on 15 October 2009, she resigned her office on grounds of age.


=== Later years ===
In October 2010 she was elected to chair the Berlin region Volkssolidarität (""People's Solidarity""), a welfare organisation for the over 65s which traces its origins back to East Berlin and the old German Democratic Republic, but which survived the traumas of reunification better than most of the state mandated East German institutions.   In 2014 a further election confirmed her in office.  By that time it was reported that the Berlin Volkssolidarität was operating around 70 day centers, retirement homes and other facilities in Berlin.

47,"Charlotte Knobloch (born 29 October 1932, as Charlotte Neuland) is the former President of Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland) from 2006 to 2010. She is also Vice President of the European Jewish Congress and the World Jewish Congress. She has for many years been one of the primary leaders of the Jewish community in Munich, as President of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde München und Oberbayern since 1985.


== Biography ==
Charlotte Knobloch was born in Munich, in 1932, into a well-to-do Jewish family of lawyers. She is the daughter of Munich lawyer and Bavarian senator Fritz Neuland. Her mother Margarethe was a born Christian, but converted to Judaism upon marrying Neuland. However, her parents divorced in 1936. She was subsequently raised by her grandmother Albertine Neuland. Upon the arrest of her father, Knobloch was saved by the former housekeeper of the Neuland family, who took her in her hand and brought her to her Christian family in Franconia, pretending she was her own illegitimate daughter.
Charlotte Neuland married the late Samuel Knobloch in 1951, and has three children.
One of her achievements is the Jewish Centre (Jüdisches Zentrum) in Munich, with a new principal Ohel Jakob synagogue and a Jewish museum. She was made an honorary citizen of Munich in 2005.
Knobloch is especially concerned with the problem of antisemitism in Eastern Europe. In the World Jewish Congress, she works to promote the German-speaking Jewish communities and to build bridges to Jewish communities in other countries. She took a controversial stand against the Stolpersteine in Munich, stumbling blocks on pavement inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution, effectively blocking their collocation on public grounds until today.In January 2009, she claimed that the Central Council was temporarily breaking off contact with the Roman Catholic Church because of the lifting of the excommunication of controversial bishop Richard Williamson.

Bundestag biography (in German)"
60,"Hannelore Kraft (née Külzhammer; born 12 June 1961) is a German politician. She served as the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2010 until 2017. Kraft was the first woman to serve as head of government of this state and was the third woman to become head of a state government in Germany. Between 1 November 2010 and 31 October 2011, she was the President of the Bundesrat, again the first woman to hold the office. She is the former leader of the SPD North Rhine-Westphalia and served on the SPD's federal executive from November 2009 until May 2017, and was one of the four federal deputy chairs.


== Early life and education ==
The daughter of a streetcar driver and a ticket collector, Kraft graduated in 1980, and first trained as a bank clerk with Dresdner Bank. She commenced her studies in economics at Comprehensive University of Duisburg in 1982, and studied at King's College London in 1986 and 1987. She completed her studies in Duisburg in 1989.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
From 1989 until 2001, Kraft was a consultant and project manager at ZENIT GmbH ('Centre for Innovation and Technology') in Mülheim an der Ruhr, and was head of the local European Info Centre.


=== Political career ===
Kraft joined the SPD in 1994. She was drawn to politics after becoming head of a works council and struggling to find a place for her son in a nursery. At the 2000 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, she was elected to the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia. Initially representing electoral district 74 (Mülheim II-Essen VII), she switched to electoral district 64 (Mülheim I) for the election in 2005.
On 24 April 2001, she replaced Detlev Samland as Minister for Federal and European Affairs, and then under Minister-President Peer Steinbrück, served from 12 November 2002 until 31 May 2005 as Minister for Science and Research.
Kraft was a SPD delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2012.


==== Chairwoman of the SPD Parliamentary Group in North Rhine-Wesphalia, 2005-2010 ====
After the SPD lost the 2005 state election in North Rhine-Westphalia, Kraft was elected leader of the SPD's parliamentary group with 95.7% of the votes, hence becoming the Opposition Leader in the state. In 2007, she was elected chairperson of the SPD in North Rhine-Westphalia.
On 13 November 2009, Kraft was elected as one of the four vice chairs of the federal SPD under chairman Sigmar Gabriel, receiving the highest overall vote. A party congress in February 2010 affirmed that she was the SPD's candidate for Minister-President at the May 2010 state election.


==== First term as Minister President, 2010-12 ====
The state election on 9 May 2010 resulted in a near-tie with the governing CDU at 67 seats, and with Kraft's preferred red-green coalition one seat short of an overall majority; at the time, the federal government under Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the result on voter anger at the first aid package for Greece.After many parallel negotiations and various coalitions, Kraft was elected Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia on 14 July 2010 on the second ballot with a sufficient majority of votes, coming from the SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens, while the Left Party abstained. Kraft formed a minority government with ministers of Social Democrats and Greens. It was the first time in Germany that a coalition has attempted to rule one of the 16 federal states without a proper majority, with the only exception being a red–green alliance governing Berlin for some months in 2001–2002 without a majority. For nearly two years, Kraft ruled the state without a regular majority, pulling votes for each initiative from opposition parties on the right or the left. Together with the deputy governor, Sylvia Löhrmann from the Green Party, Kraft dubbed her government the ""invitation coalition"".After decades of ideological rivalry in the state over the structure of secondary schools, both Kraft and Löhrmann later succeeded in negotiating a cross-party agreement with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union that is to ensure peace until 2023.Kraft got attention for a eulogy she gave after a stampede killed 21 people at the Love Parade music festival in July 2010, less than two weeks after she became state premier. When she gave her speech at a memorial ceremony, she spoke of the hours she spent waiting to hear from her son, who was at the event, unsure if he was injured or unharmed, alive or dead.In October 2010, Kraft was elected President of the Bundesrat, according to the customary rotation of the presidency between the Bundesländer. She assumed office on 1 November 2010, becoming the first female office holder, remaining in office until 31 October 2011.
At an SPD convention in Berlin in December 2011, Kraft was confirmed in her vice-chairmanship by 97 percent of party members, the best result for a board member.Krafts failure to get her 2012 budget plans passed after a court ruled a supplementary budget for 2010 unconstitutional forced her to call an early election and left her exposed to charges of fiscal incompetence. Kraft had hoped to win backing from the opposition FDP for the budget but their long-standing objections were not overcome in time for the vote.


==== Second term as Minister President, 2012-2017 ====
The resulting election saw the SPD-Green coalition win a nine-seat majority and allowed Kraft to remain in office. Cabinet Kraft II is quite similar to Cabinet Kraft I.
Soon after the May 2012 elections, Kraft placed third in a Der Spiegel poll among German politicians right after Chancellor Angela Merkel and the new federal president, Joachim Gauck, and ahead of any other politician in the SPD including Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who lost to Merkel in 2009, and party chairman Sigmar Gabriel. This vaulted Kraft into the top rank of German politicians, prompting speculation that she might be the strongest contender to lead the party against Merkel and potentially succeed her as chancellor. However, she soon announced that she did not want to become the SPD's candidate for chancellor, preferring instead to stay in her home state for the five-year term she had just won.In 2013, Kraft initially opposed national SPD leaders who opted to join Merkel as junior partner for the second time. However, she subsequently was part of the SPD team led by Sigmar Gabriel, which led the negotiations towards forming a new German government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc. She headed the SPD's delegation in the energy working group and vocally defended the coal industry, which has a sizeable presence in her state; her co-chair from the CDU/CSU was Peter Altmaier.In 2014, Kraft's government plans record spending of 62 billion euros ($85 billion) while trimming the deficit by a quarter to 2.4 billion euros. At the same time, she has repeatedly criticized Merkel's austerity policies during the debt crisis.In March 2014, Kraft hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in Duisburg as he visited the last stop on the Yuxinou Railway between Europe and Asia.Following her party's loss in the 2017 state elections, Kraft remained a member of the State Parliament where she currently serves on the Committee on Sports. She also joined the supervisory board of RAG AG. In 2019, her official portrait – a photograph made by Jim Rakete – was unveiled to the public. In 2020, she announced her intention not to run again in the 2022 state elections.


== Political positions ==


=== Energy ===
In 2012, Kraft placed investment in renewable energy at the center of her second term's agenda, stating that more than 30 per cent of electricity in NRW should be coming from renewable sources by 2025. In 2013, Kraft called on Angela Merkel to use tax revenue to cut electricity costs for consumers by 25 percent. On energy companies extracting oil and natural gas by the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Kraft stated in 2014 that ""[a]s long as I am governor in North Rhine-Westphalia, there will be no fracking for unconventional natural gas."" She also helped get a resolution through the Bundesrat on tighter rules for fracking, after visiting Canada to get a first-hand look at shale oil extraction there.


=== Tax evasion ===
Early in her time in office, Kraft focused on tax evasion, which is a policy that is not exclusively the reserve of the federal government and thus allowed to her to both exercise her power in her state as well as in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the federal parliament, where the states are presented and the opposition had a majority at the time. In 2013, Kraft led the Bundesrat opposition to a tax agreement with Switzerland, eventually blocking it as too easy on tax dodgers. Under the proposed law, Germans with untaxed wealth in Switzerland would have been able to legitimize their holdings and retain their anonymity in exchange for paying a one-off penalty charge and submitting to a future withholding tax.


=== Art ===
In 2013, the heir of a prominent Jewish art dealer Alfred Flechtheim, who fled Nazi Germany, urged the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to relinquish paintings by Paul Klee and Juan Gris that he says were lost due to Nazi persecution; Kraft declined to comment. In 2014, Kraft rejected demands made by museum directors in North Rhine-Westphalia who sought to prevent the sale of two Andy Warhol paintings, Triple Elvis (1963) and Four Marlons (1966), by the former West LB at Christie's New York; in a letter in response to the museum directors, she held that she could not stop the sale because the paintings were not considered items of national cultural importance.


=== Immigration ===
In summer 2015, when Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed tens of thousands of asylum seekers camped out in Hungary to travel to Germany, Kraft asserted that this had sent a signal to thousands of migrants to head straight for Germany; at the time, North Rhine-Westphalia was taking in around a fifth of the new arrivals.


=== Relations with France ===
Alongside Senator Catherine Troendle, Kraft served as co-chairwoman of the German-French Friendship Group set up by the German Bundesrat and the French Senate.
With 2014 marking the centenary of the start of World War I, Kraft inaugurated a memorial for the Armistice Day in Ablain-Saint-Nazaire alongside French President François Hollande and German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, as well as British and Belgian officials.On 26 March 2015, Kraft joined Merkel, Hollande and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain at the crash site of Germanwings Flight 9525 in the Massif des Trois-Évêchés for a memorial; North Rhine-Westphalia was the state where the plane was headed and many of the 144 passengers lived. One day later, she and Germany's President Joachim Gauck attended a memorial service in the western town of Haltern for 16 students and two teachers from the local high school who were killed in the crash.

63,"Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (German pronunciation: [ˈanəɡʁeːt ˈkʁamp ˈkaʁənˌbaʊɐ]; née Kramp; born 9 August 1962), sometimes referred to by her initials of AKK, is a retired German politician who served as Minister of Defence from 2019 to 2021 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2018 to 2021.
In February 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced that she would resign her position as CDU leader later in the year and would not put herself forward as a candidate for chancellor for the 2021 federal election. She was succeeded by Armin Laschet at the January 2021 CDU leadership election.Kramp-Karrenbauer previously served as secretary general of the party and as Minister President of Saarland from 2011 to 2018, the first woman to lead the Government of Saarland and fourth woman to head a German state government. Kramp-Karrenbauer is regarded as socially conservative, but on the CDU's left wing in economic policy and has been described as a centrist. She is an active Catholic and has served on the Central Committee of German Catholics. She is the second woman to hold the office of German defence minister. She was succeeded by Christine Lambrecht.
In October 2021 she proposed for the use of nuclear weapons against Russia via a First-Strike capability as a deterrence against any ""provocation"" or aggression.She renounced her Bundestag mandate and retired from politics after the 2021 federal election.


== Life and education ==
Annegret Kramp was born on 9 August 1962 in Völklingen, located on the Saar River midway between Saarlouis and Saarbrücken, around 40 kilometres from Luxembourg and close to the border with France. She grew up in the neighbouring town of Püttlingen. Her father was a special education teacher and a headmaster. She graduated from high school in 1982 and considered becoming a school teacher, but decided to study politics and law at the University of Trier and at Saarland University, where she earned a master's degree in 1990.


== Early political career ==
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer joined the CDU while still in high school in 1981. In 1984 she was elected to the district council of Püttlingen, and in 1985 became chairwoman of the city's CDU association. From 1985 to 1988 she was also a member of the regional board of the Young Union in Saarland. From 1991 to 1998 she served as a policy and planning officer for the CDU in Saarland under environment minister Klaus Töpfer. In 1998, Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced Töpfer in the federal Bundestag, serving seven months before losing re-election in the SPD landslide the same year. In 1999, she was an advisor to Peter Müller, then chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in the Landtag of Saarland and later Minister-President. That same year she became a chairwoman of the Women's Union.


=== State Minister 1999–2011 ===
Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected to the Landtag of Saarland in 1999. She served as Minister of the Interior in the government of Peter Müller; the first woman to hold that office in Germany. She took on more responsibilities in 2004, and changed roles in 2007 following a cabinet reshuffle, becoming Minister of Education and again in 2009, becoming Minister of Labor in the so-called Jamaica coalition government. In 2008, she was elected chairwoman of the Kultusministerkonferenz. Throughout her time in state government, she also served at various times as minister responsible for women, sports, family, and culture. In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2009 federal election, Kramp-Karrenbauer was part of the CDU–CSU delegation in the working group on education and research policy, led by Annette Schavan and Andreas Pinkwart.


=== Minister-President of Saarland 2011–2018 ===
In 2011, after months of difficult negotiations with the coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party and The Greens, Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected Minister-President of the Saarland in a special session of parliament, replacing Müller, who resigned to become a judge at the Federal Constitutional Court. Shortly afterwards, she ended the coalition and triggered an election, blaming the party for ""dismantling itself"" and arguing that the three-party coalition had lost the necessary ""trust, stability, and capacity to act"". Kramp-Karrenbauer and the CDU won the state election soon afterwards, in what was widely regarded as the first electoral test of Chancellor Angela Merkel's crisis-fighting policy since the beginning of the European debt crisis; meanwhile, the FDP was ejected from the state parliament after taking just 1.2% of the vote.
Under Kramp-Karrenbauer's leadership, the CDU won 40.7% of the vote in the 2017 state elections, up from 35.2% in 2012.While serving as Minister-President, Kramp-Karrenbauer, who speaks French, was also Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation between 2011 and 2014. She continued to be a member of the German-French Friendship Group that was set up by the upper chambers of the German and French national parliaments, respectively the Bundesrat and the Senate. Furthermore, as one of the state's representatives at the federal Bundesrat, she served on the Committee on Cultural Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Defence. Kramp-Karrenbauer was a CDU delegate to the Federal Convention to elect the president of Germany in 2012 and in 2017. She was also for a short time part of the CDU–CSU delegation's leadership team in the negotiations to form a ""grand coalition"" following the 2013 federal elections. She again played a role in the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2018, leading a working group on education policy alongside Stefan Müller, Manuela Schwesig and Hubertus Heil.
As Minister-President of Saarland, Kramp-Karrenbauer promoted the French language, aiming to make the state fully bilingual in German and French and thus promote Saarland as a bicultural European region similar to neighbouring Luxembourg. While Saarland had rejoined Germany five years before Kramp-Karrenbauer's birth when a majority voted against becoming an independent state, it has a long history of association with France dating back to the late 18th century.


=== Secretary General of the CDU, 2018 ===
In February 2018, Merkel nominated Kramp-Karrenbauer as the new secretary general of the CDU. She was confirmed at the CDU party conference on 26 February, securing 98.87% of the vote. As secretary general, she managed the party and oversaw its election campaigns. She also embarked on a major listening tour of the country, holding more than 40 meetings with local CDU associations and working on a new political manifesto for the party.


=== 2018 CDU leadership election ===
In October 2018, following bad results for the CDU/CSU in state elections in Bavaria and Hesse, Chancellor Merkel announced she would not stand for re-election as party leader in the CDU convention at the end of the year, triggering a leadership election. Former Bundestag leader of the CDU and businessman Friedrich Merz jumped into the race immediately while Health Minister Jens Spahn and Kramp-Karrenbauer announced their bids shortly after. Kramp-Karrenbauer was perceived to be Merkel's chosen heir and a continuation of her style and centrist ideology while Merz was an old rival from Merkel's early days as party leader and was very open about his intention to move the party in a more conservative direction. Nevertheless, the Chancellor did not state her preferences.As the vote approached, opinion polls showed that Kramp-Karrenbauer was favoured by CDU voters and the general public alike. The contest was held on 7 December and after coming out on top in the first round, Kramp-Karrenbauer narrowly defeated Merz in a run-off, becoming the new leader of the CDU.


=== Leader of the CDU, 2018–2020 ===
In the immediate aftermath of her election, surveys showed an increase in the CDU's vote share; however, it was short-lived. In the first months of her tenure, there were a series of gaffes and according to the press a failure to connect with voters. In the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament election, which was seen as her first major electoral test, the CDU's campaign was embroiled by a row between the party and YouTube personality Rezo. It was caused by a viral YouTube video posted by Rezo in which he called out the parties of the governing Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) and urged viewers not to vote for them. Kramp-Karrenbauer reacted, stating that the electoral law should be changed to prevent social media personalities like Rezo from influencing the voters' choice in the midst of a campaign. The statement was harshly criticized as an attack on freedom of expression and damaged the image of Kramp-Karrenbauer among young people. Shortly afterwards, a Bloomberg report stated that Chancellor Merkel thought that her successor was not up to the job, further hindering her popularity.The European Elections resulted in the CDU's worst national showing ever, below 30%. After the underwhelming result, rumors emerged that some CDU politicians planned to shun Kramp-Karrenbauer and put up another Chancellor candidate for the next Bundestag election. Tilman Meyer, a political scientist at University of Bonn, told Focus that the mounting pressure on Kramp-Karrenbauer could lead to the CDU going into the next election with a more conservative candidate such as Friedrich Merz, a former CDU parliamentary leader, in response to the rise of the far-right.
Kramp-Karrenbauer announced her resignation as leader of the CDU on 10 February 2020 as a result of the 2020 Thuringian government crisis. The former plan was that she would resign in the summer and her successor would be elected, but this was postponed to December due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


=== Minister of Defence, 2019–2021 ===
When Ursula von der Leyen was elected President of the European Commission in July 2019, Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded her as Federal Minister of Defence in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel. This was the first time that she held a position in the federal government.For the 2021 elections, Kramp-Karrenbauer was later elected to lead the CDU campaign in Saarland. Shortly after having been elected, she announced her decision to step down from the parliament and instead make room for Markus Uhl who had failed to secure a seat.International crises
In November 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that in the disputed territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh, ""the first real drone war in human history has just been conducted between Azerbaijan and Armenia, with devastating consequences for the losing side.""In April 2021, Kramp-Karrenbauer accused Russia of taking provocative actions with its troop buildup in Crimea and along its western border, while rejecting Russia's claim that it was responding to a massive NATO-led military exercise called Defender-Europe 21, one of the largest NATO-led military exercises in Europe in decades, which began in March 2021.In mid-2021, Kramp-Karrenbauer oversaw the German miliary's withdrawal from Afghanistan after almost two decades. In July 2021, she sent the frigate Bayern off on a seven-month voyage that will take it to Australia, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, making it the first German warship to pass through the South China Sea since 2002.Armed forces
During her time in office, Kramp-Karrenbauer publicly apologized to soldiers who for decades faced discrimination, discharge or convictions on the basis of their sexual orientation. In 2021, she successfully introduced legislation to rehabilitate those soldiers.In 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer disbanded a company of the Special Forces Command (KSK) after police seized weapons and ammunition during a raid on the property of a KSK soldier. She later resisted calls for KSK to be disbanded altogether and instead pushed through the unit's reform.In June 2021, Kramp-Karrenbauer recalled 30 German soldiers from service at the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence in Lithuania, with ringleaders facing immediate dismissal, after an article in Der Spiegel accused them of making racist and anti-Semitic remarks and of sexual violence.Also in 2021, Kramp-Karrenbauer opened the Bundeswehr's first-ever Air and Space Operations Centre (ASOC) in Uedem, expanding Germany's existing space situation center into the new structure.


=== Popularity ===
During Kramp-Karrenbauer's tenure as Minister-President of Saarland, she had constantly high approval ratings in the low  to mid-70's among her constituents. She was the most popular politician in Saarland according to Infratest dimap from November 2010 until her departure as Minister-President. Kramp-Karrenbauer was considered one of the most popular state government leaders nationwide.When entering federal politics, Kramp-Karrenbauer had a positive net approval rating from her election as CDU General Secretary in February 2018 until March 2019, just shortly after having been elected as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union. Her nationwide popularity peaked in January 2019, when she had a net approval of +17% and was seen as second-most popular politician overall. There was then a sharp decline in her popularity following gaffes and electoral defeats for the Christian Democrats in several elections. As of February 2020, she is one of the least popular German politicians.


== Political positions ==


=== Domestic policies ===
Kramp-Karrenbauer is perceived as a moderate or centrist Christian Democrat. She has been described as socially conservative, but on the CDU's left wing in economic policy. She is regarded as more conservative than Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, in the German press, her often used nickname during her party leadership was ""Mini-Merkel"", reflecting both her size and her political views.
Kramp-Karrenbauer opposes same sex marriage, having compared it to incest and polygamy. However, when the Mayor of Hamburg Olaf Scholz submitted a motion for a mandatory gender quota for supervisory boards to the Bundesrat in 2012, Kramp-Karrenbauer joined the state governments controlled by the Social Democrats (the SPD), voting in favour of the draft legislation; in doing so, she supported an initiative opposed by Merkel and state governments controlled by the CDU.Amid her party's campaign for the 2013 federal elections, Kramp-Karrenbauer suggested Germany return to a top income tax rate of more than 53%, setting off a fierce debate in her party. In her view, Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schröder had gone too far in reducing the top rate from 53% to 42% in the 1990s. In May 2014, she was among leading members of Merkel's CDU who called for reductions to offset fiscal drag—the automatic increases in the tax-take that occur as inflation and income growth push wage-earners further into their marginal higher tax-bracket.When the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in favour of tax equality for same-sex couples in 2013, Kramp-Karrenbauer voiced her concerns about also granting full adoption rights for same-sex couples, stating: ""The traditional family unit is the core of not only Germany but all nations"". In 2015, she caused a public controversy by arguing that ""if we open up [the definition of marriage] to become a long-term responsible partnership between two adults, then other demands can't be ruled out, such as a marriage between close relatives or between more than two people"".
For the 2021 national elections, Kramp-Karrenbauer endorsed Armin Laschet as the Christian Democrats' joint candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.


=== Foreign policy ===
Kramp-Karrenbauer criticised the German-supported Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that would allow Germany to effectively double the amount of gas it imports from Russia, saying that Nord Stream 2 ""is not just an economic project but a political one"". In January 2019, U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell sent letters to German companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2, threatening CAATSA sanctions. In response, Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that ""the American ambassador operates in a, shall I say, somewhat unusual diplomatic manner.""Kramp-Karrenbauer has supported arms exports to Saudi Arabia, which has been waging war in Yemen and was condemned for massive human rights violations. Kramp-Karrenbauer accused the Social Democrats (SPD) of jeopardising German industry and jobs, saying that, with Germany's ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia, ""Germany is not very credible at the moment"" in European security and defence policy and was ""making common European projects practically impossible"".In late 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer proposed that the European Union should try again to reach a trade agreement with the United States after the elections.In October 2021, Kramp-Karrenbauer had talked about the possibility of deploying nuclear arms against Russia.


==== Migrants and refugees ====
Kramp-Karrenbauer supports stricter immigration policies. Kramp-Karrenbauer supported Angela Merkel's refugee policies and her decision to let migrants into Germany in 2015–2016, many fleeing wars in the Middle East, but demanded more toughness in some cases. At the beginning of 2016, she declared herself against a unilateral closure of German borders, since she feared a break-up of the European Union. In December 2017, Kramp-Karrenbauer remarked: ""Bei unbegleiteten Minderjährigen sollte eine verbindliche Altersprüfung eingeführt werden."" (A mandatory age investigation should be initiated for all unaccompanied minors.) She said refugees may often provide a false age in order to be treated as youths rather than adult asylum-seekers. She added, ""Jemand, der seine Identität verschleiert oder Papiere vernichtet hat, muss mit harten Konsequenzen rechnen."" (Anyone who conceals their identity or has destroyed papers must face harsh consequences.)  According to her, data sources like mobile phones should be checked, in order to establish a person's identity. Furthermore, instead of carrying out deportations with commercial airplanes, she said it may be necessary to use their separate aircraft. She demanded in November 2018 that after expulsion offenders must be refused re-entry for life, not only to Germany but also throughout the Schengen area, and cited the 2018 gang rape in Freiburg as an example.

However, she fell short of the required two-thirds majority approval. The left-wing coalition government accused the Christian Democratic Union of abstaining from the vote despite pledging to confirm Kreck, though this could not be proven due to the secret ballot and lack of comment from the CDU.After in the 2021 Berlin state election, Kreck was appointed Senator for Justice, Diversity and Anti-Discrimination in the Giffey senate. Kreck is considered close to the libertarian socialist Emancipatory Left current within the party, and served alongside Katja Kipping on the editorial board of the group's former journal Prague Spring.

71,"Renate Elly Künast (born 15 December 1955) is a German politician of Alliance 90/The Greens party. She was the Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture from 2001 to 2005 and subsequently served as chairwoman of her party's parliamentary group in the Bundestag.


== Early life and career ==
Künast was born in Recklinghausen, North Rhine-Westphalia. She studied social work in Düsseldorf and worked from 1977 to 1979 in this profession in a jailhouse in Berlin. After that she studied law at the Free University of Berlin until 1985. During her student years, she often protested against the Gorleben nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant.  She later worked as lawyer specializing on aliens law and criminal law.


== Political career ==


=== Career in state politics ===
Since 1979, Künast has been a member of the German Green Party (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen), first in the Alternative List in West Berlin. In the 1990s she was member of parliament and chairwoman of the Green Party's group in the state parliament of Berlin. During that time, she won cross-party respect for her leading role in drafting a new democratic constitution for the reunified city-state. Künast eventually became the party's spokeswoman for legal issues. In 1998, she re-assumed the floor leadership post alongside Michaele Schreyer.In national politics, Künast came to be known as a tough negotiator for her work in drafting the national red-green coalition agreement after the 1998 federal parliamentary elections. In October 1999, she was the Green' front-runner in Berlin's state elections.
From June 2000 to March 2001, Künast served as co-chair of Bündnis 90/Die Grünen on the national level, together with Fritz Kuhn. 


=== Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, 2001–2005 ===
Künast became Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in the second government of Germany Gerhard Schröder in 2001. Since her party at the time did not allow the combination of functions in the party and the government in one person, she had to resign from her role as the party's co-chair.
By naming someone with no experience in farming to head a ministry with such sweeping powers, Schröder was widely considered gambling that any loss of support among farmers would be more than compensated by support from ecologically conscious Germans alarmed by the discovery of mad cow disease.Künast held the office of Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection until 2005, over time becoming known for increasing consumer protection, supporting organic farming, and expanding animal welfare. During her time in office, she ranked behind only Schröder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in public opinion polls.


=== Member of the German Parliament, 2002–present ===
Following the 2002 elections, Künast was part of the Green Party's team in the negotiations with the Social Democrats on a coalition agreement for the second government under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. 
After the 2005 federal election, Künast became co-chair of the Green Party's parliamentary group, initially together with Fritz Kuhn and later with Jürgen Trittin. In the 2005 vote, she won against Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt. Also since 2005, she has been serving on the Committee on the Election of Judges (Wahlausschuss), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.
Künast announced on 5 November 2010 that she we would be the candidate for Governing Mayor of Berlin for Alliance 90/The Greens in the 2011 Berlin state election. At the time of the announcement, her party was eight percentage points ahead of the Social Democrats in the opinion polls. Under her leadership, the Green Party came third with 17.6 percent of the vote, ten percentage points behind the Social Democrates but still up from the 13.1 percent they won in the previous election. However, incumbent Klaus Wowereit from the Social Democrats chose to enter a coalition with the conservative CDU, leaving Künast without any role in Berlin state politics.
Ahead of the 2013 elections, Künast announced her candidacy to lead the Green Party’s campaign. In an internal vote, she ultimately lost against Katrin Göring-Eckardt and Jürgen Trittin.After the 2013 elections, the resignation of Künast and Trittin as co-leaders of the Green Party's group in parliament cleared the way for the election of Göring-Eckardt and Anton Hofreiter. Instead, Künast unsuccessfully ran against Claudia Roth for the office of Vice President of the German Bundestag. She eventually served as chairwoman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Consumer Protection from 2014 until 2017. Since 2018, she has been a member of the Committee on Food and Agriculture. 
In the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), the Green Party and the FDP following the 2021 federal elections, Künast led her party's delegation in the working group on agriculture and nutrition; her co-chairs from the other parties are Till Backhaus and Carina Konrad.

== Political positions ==


=== Human rights ===
In 2010, Künast criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel for speaking at an award ceremony for Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard in Potsdam, arguing that while it was true that the right to freedom of expression also applies to Westergaard's controversial Muhammad cartoons ""if a chancellor also makes a speech on top of that, it serves to heat up the debate.""In August 2012, Künast was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy Riot. ""Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are draconian and disproportionate"", the lawmakers said in the letter. ""In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts -- even if they can be seen as provocative -- must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.""In 2015, Künast was the initiator of a bill in favor of legalizing assisted suicide, arguing that ""a punishment of commercial euthanasia would expose doctors to the severe risk of legal investigations."" However, the Bundestag later voted to criminalize organizations that assist patients seeking to terminate their lives in return for payment and makes assisting a suicide punishable by up to three years in prison.


=== Regulation of digital platforms ===
In 2021, Künast requested the personal data of several Facebook users to pursue the authors of 22 insulting comments against her, many of which were of a sexist or violent nature. In 2022, the Federal Constitutional Court sided with Künast personal data.


=== Economic policy ===
Amid the financial crisis of 2007–08, Künast proposed to solve the state-owned banks' financial woes and to merge the Germany's then eight regional banks into one institution, which would concentrate on regional economic development. In a 2008 interview with newspaper Welt am Sonntag: ""The regional banks should be merged into one and their functions need to be clearly laid out."" Ahead of the 2009 federal elections, in an attempt to come up with an antidote to the other political parties' hijacking of green ideas, Künast and her fellow lead candidate Jürgen Trittin backed up their critique of incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel's government with a ""Green New Deal"", calling for €20 billion ($27.4 billion) a year to be invested in climate protection, environmental technology and education.


=== Consumer protection ===
In 2010, Künast called for a ban on advertising for sweets aimed at children.


=== Relations with the CDU ===
Over the course of her career, Künast has regularly dismissed prospects for an alternative coalition between the Greens and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union on a national level.


== Recognition ==
In 2010, Künast – along with Cécile Duflot, Monica Frassoni, and Marina Silva – was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers, for taking Green mainstream.


== Personal life ==
Künast has been married to lawyer Rüdiger Portius since 2011. From 2001, she shared an apartment with Katrin Göring-Eckardt in Berlin’s Friedenau district.


== Controversy ==


=== Hate speech ===
Künast was personally extremely insulted  by hate speech on the net; mostly on Facebook she got sexually insulted. Künast fights more consistently than almost any other German politician against these form of violent by anonymous persons. 
The Berlin Regional Court initially found that these were all permissible expressions of opinion, Künast had provoked these comments because of a misleading statement in 1986 about sex with children. Künast lodged an appeal. As a result, the district court obliged Facebook to provide information about the authors of some comments, so that the politician could take legal action against these people. 
All this has been annulled by the Federal Constitutional Court (BVG) in February 2022. The Berlin courts had not weighed properly. The Berlin court had always evaluated all comments in the context of the discussion, BVG said. But even with a reference to a public debate, not everything is allowed.


=== Antisemitism ===
In July 2009 Künast was accused of antisemitism by the Jerusalem Post, after she had allegedly been overheard calling the pro-Israel ""Stop The Bomb"" organisation a ""Mossad front"", which she denied.


=== Domestic security ===
In October 2015 Künast advised the police officer Tania Kambouri during a talk show that the police should take their shoes off before raids in mosques. Kambouri had published a book about her experience with the rising violence by Muslim men against law enforcement and especially against women.In July 2016 Künast posted a Tweet in which she questioned the shooting of an Afghan refugee and ISIS sympathiser who severely injured five people with an axe. She was criticized for publicly accusing the police of wrongdoing without knowing the details and before the official investigation was started. Members from her party distanced themselves from the statement and said that they trusted the German police. Police union chief Rainier Wendt called her a ""parliamentary smart aleck"".

74,"Christine Lambrecht (born 19 June 1965) is a German senior politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who served as the German Federal Minister of Defence in the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, from 2021 to 2023. In Chancellor Angela Merkel's administration, Lambrecht previously served as Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection (2019–2021), Minister for Family Affairs (2021) and as one of two Parliamentary State Secretaries at the Federal Ministry of Finance (2018– 2019). She previously held various roles within the SPD Parliamentary Group, including as a Deputy Leader (from 2011 to 2013) and from December 2013 to September 2017 as first parliamentary secretary of the SPD parliamentary group.


== Education and early career ==
Lambrecht attended the Albertus-Magnus-Gymnasium in Viernheim, in the German state of Hesse, and in 1984 she passed her Abitur. After this she studied law at the Universities of Mannheim and Mainz, where she graduated in 1992 and completed an internship at State Court in Darmstadt.


== Political career ==


=== Career in local politics ===
Lambrecht joined the SPD in 1982 and was a member of the Viernheim City Council from 1985 till 2001, of which she was the chair in the years 1997 till 2001. Additionally she was a member of the Bergstraße County Council from 1989 until 1997.


=== Member of the German Parliament, 1998–2021 ===
Lambrecht first became a Member of the Bundestag in the 1998 elections. From 1998 until 2002 she was the member for Bergstraße, however, she lost against her CDU challenger in the 2002 federal election and has subsequently always been elected via the SPD Hessian state list. In parliament, she has served on the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Sports and on the Council of Elders, which sets the agenda for the parliamentary sessions. Lambrecht was seen as being on the left wing of the SPD parliamentary group.From 2002 until 2005 and from 2013 until 2017, Lambrecht served on the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG).
Following the 2009 elections, Lambrecht became her parliamentary group's spokesperson on legal affairs. In 2011, she was elected as a deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group, under the leadership of chairman Frank-Walter Steinmeier. She was a deputy leader of the group till her election as first parliamentary secretary of the SPD parliamentary group after the 2013 federal election. In the ensuing negotiations to form a third coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel, she was part of the SPD delegation in the working group on internal and legal affairs, led by Hans-Peter Friedrich and Thomas Oppermann.
In the negotiations to form Merkel’s fourth coalition government following the 2017 federal elections, Lambrecht was part of the working group on financial policies and taxes, led by Peter Altmaier, Andreas Scheuer and Olaf Scholz. In Merkel's fourth cabinet, she joined the federal government as one of two Parliamentary State Secretaries serving under Finance Minister Olaf Scholz.


=== Federal Minister of Justice, 2019–2021 ===
On 19 June 2019 it was announced that Lambrecht would succeed justice minister Katarina Barley on the 1 July 2019, after the latter moved to Brussels to serve in the European Parliament. During Lambrecht's time in office, German authorities fined Facebook 2 million euros for under-reporting complaints about illegal content on its social media platform in breach of the country’s law on internet transparency. In December 2019, she proposed a law requiring internet service providers like Gmail or WhatsApp to handover personal data including passwords upon request.In response to the burning of an Israeli flag at a demonstration in 2017, Lambrecht led efforts in 2020 to make the destruction of foreign state flags, including that of the European Union, and the denigration of national anthems punishable by a fine and up to three years in prison.In September 2020, Lambrecht announced that she would not stand in the 2021 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.


=== Federal Minister for Family Affairs, 2021 ===
In May 2021, Lambrecht additionally took on the portfolio of the Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Women, and Youth, after Franziska Giffey resigned in reaction to her plagiarism affair.


=== Federal Minister of Defence, 2021–2023 ===
Lambrecht was named Federal Minister of Defence in the cabinet of Olaf Scholz, taking office on 8 December 2021. At the time, German defence forces were in a very bad condition. In one of her first speeches, Lambrecht asked for more money for the German army. Referring to many deficiencies in the materiel, she said that the army was too often ridiculed for helicopters that did not fly and guns that did not hit. Indeed, Lambrecht was not exaggerating as it had been known for years that the army was lacking 20-30 billion euros worth of ammunition.Early in her tenure, Lambrecht and Germany as a whole were severely criticized for their very sluggish response to requests by Kyiv for military aid in face of the threatening Russian invasion. In January 2022 Lambrecht and much of the German public opinion eschewed weapons in favor of non-lethal items. In the end, Lambrecht offered 5,000 helmets and a field hospital and said that it was ""a clear signal that Germany was behind Ukraine"". Lambrecht probably intended it as such, but the offer was received very differently. Ukraine's capital's mayor, Vitaly Klitschko dismissed it as ""a joke"". In Germany itself reactions were no less critical. Many media thought that Germany was the laughing stock of international politics and was proving itself to be unreliable. Criticism centered on Lambrecht's actions, and the incidents that she had caused while barely two months in office.In early February Lambrecht oversaw efforts to send up to 350 more German troops to Lithuania, reinforcing a German-led NATO Enhanced Forward Presence combat unit deployed there to deter a Russian attack on the Baltic states. After the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Scholz held his Zeitenwende speech on 27 February. Immediately after this speech, the ministry of defense requested 250 firms to mobilize every resource in order to make the Bundeswehr combat ready as soon as possible.With regard to the air force, the ministry quickly announced plans to purchase 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter jets to replace its Panavia Tornado. and to buy 60 Boeing CH-47 Chinook heavy transport helicopters worth around 5 billion euros ($5.40 billion).In March 2022, Lambrecht was openly criticized by Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian president, for saying that ""NATO won't intervene in the Russo-Ukrainian War"". Podolyak stated that each such statement encourages the Russian massacre in Ukraine.In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Germany delivered aid and weapons to Ukraine. Taken from the German Bundeswehr this included 3,000 Panzerfaust 3 anti-tank weapons, 500 Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, over 2,000 9K32 Strela-2  anti-aircraft missile systems, 100 MG 3 machine guns, 16 million rounds of ammunitions, 23,000 combat helmets, 1,300 bullet-proof vests, night vision devices, 500,000 military food rations, 14 armored cars and other systems.By April 2022, Lambrecht announced that the German army's stocks are depleted and additional deliveries have to come from the arms manufacturers directly.In May 2022, Lambrecht led negotiations with fellow cabinet members Christian Lindner and Annalena Baerbock as well as Mathias Middelberg on securing a two-thirds majority in parliament needed to change Germany’s constitution to allow for a credit-based special defense fund of 100 billion euros ($107.35 billion).In August 2022, Lambrecht sent 13 military aircraft to join the Exercise Pitch Black in Australia, the German Air Force’s largest peacetime deployment, underlining Germany’s increased focus on the Indo-Pacific amid rising tensions with China in the region.In October 2022, Lambrecht visited Odesa to meet with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, in her first visit to the country since the invasion.In a widely criticized New Year's Eve address she stated that the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to ""a lot of special experiences"" and a chance for ""many encounters with great and interesting people"".On 16 January 2023, Lambrecht announced her decision to step down as Defence Minister. This came after she had repeatedly been criticized for her work in the role and after multiple politically embarrassing incidents. Lambrecht blamed the media for focusing on her, instead of conducting fact based reporting. A few weeks after her resignation it became clear that the already very weak German army had supplied goods to Ukraine for about 1 billion euros, but that the ministry had only ordered replacements for 50 million euros. Replacement of the other goods had not even been requested, even while funding was available.
