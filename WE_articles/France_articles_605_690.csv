Biography at the French Parliament"
6,"Audrey Pulvar (French pronunciation: [odʁe pylvaʁ]; born 21 February 1972) is a French journalist, television and radio host and politician. Newsreader of the 19/20 on France 3 from 2005 to 2009, Pulvar has been commentator within Laurent Ruquier's show On n'est pas couché on France 2, during the year 2011/2012 and joined the Television Group Canal+ and its channel D8 in 2013.


== Early life ==
Audrey Pulvar's childhood was spent in Fort-de-France, Martinique, experiencing a rich cultural environment and becoming immersed in politics. Her father, Marc Pulvar, mathematics teacher, was National Secretary of the Martinican Separatist Movement (that he also founded) and Secretary of Martinican Central Workers' Trade Union Confederation. Her mother is a social worker.
From the age of 14 years, Audrey Pulvar lived between her island and mainland France. Although most of her education took place in mainland France, she received her secondary school diploma in the Caribbean before moving back to mainland France (Rouen), and getting a graduate degree in Economics (University of Rouen). She continued her studies at the École supérieure de journalisme de Paris (ESJ) which she left in 1994. She then joined Édouard Balladur's presidential election team.


== Career ==
She then joined the Antilles Television staff as an intern during her training at ESJ. She was hired afterwards as a photojournalist and from 1995 was the evening news' anchorwoman. Finally, in 1999, she became deputy editor-in-chief of the channel while continuing as anchor. She stayed there until April 2002, when Jean-Claude Dassier hired her on the satellite continuous news channel LCI as freelance journalist. Starting from December she simultaneously worked on TV5.
In November 2003, she became regional television news presenter at France 3 Marseille. After some replacements on national television, she hosted Soir 3 at Louis Lafarge's side from September 2004. As the first black woman to present a television news on a terrestrial French channel, she refused to see it as a symbol and to take the lead.

From September 2005, still on France 3, she hosted the evening television news, 19/20. As well, she presented special programmes such as the third edition of Les Victoires du jazz along with Pierre Lescure, and Français, à coeur et à cris in May 2006. In late 2008, she was among the few ""well-known"" people working in France 3 to join the protest against the prohibition of advertising on France Télévisions.
Since 2006, she has also been the presenter of a monthly magazine named Parlez-moi d'ailleurs, broadcast on the parliamentary channel.
In July 2009, when she left France 3, she joined the news channel i>Télé in order to present a programme from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. daily, as well as a political interview programme on Sundays. Laurent Bignolas became her successor on 19/20.
After the departure of Nicolas Demorand, who left the early morning radio show of France Inter, Pulvar took over the time slot from 6 to 7 A.M. and gave her program a ""prominent place for international news"", according to the radio Deputy Director, Philippe Val. At the same time, she continued to collaborate with i>Télé but chose to reduce her program length to only one hour, from 7:00 to 8:00 P.M.
Later on in November 2010, the i>Télé managers decided to suspend her from the show, in reaction to her partner Arnaud Montebourg officially claiming to be a Socialist Party candidate for the presidential election in 2012. Several weeks later, she finally put an end to the controversy around that dismissal by coming back on air. She was in charge of a 10 minutes-long non-political interview at 7:40 P.M. which was cancelled at the end of the year.
In January 2011, France Inter decided to remove her 7:50 A.M. interview, but she continued to lead the 6/7 A.M. slot and has an all new column at 8:37. In late January 2011, Pulvar returned to i>Télé to present a debate upon social issues without any political guest, known as Arrêt sur l'info. She left the channel in July 2011.
In September 2011, Pulvar appeared on the Saturday night talk show On n'est pas couché on France 2 with Natacha Polony, which is hosted by the popular TV personality Laurent Ruquier.
After being fired from the Ruquier's talk show, Pulvar now appears in the daily talk show Le Grand 8 on D8.Involved in Parisian local politics for a number of years, on 3 July 2020 Pulvar became Deputy Mayor of Paris in charge of sustainable food, agriculture and supply chains.


== Personal life ==
Pulvar has a daughter born in 1997. She lived with the chef Alain Passard from 2008 to 2009.
Then until November 2012, her partner was the French politician Arnaud Montebourg, former deputy chief secretary of the French Socialist Party, and after May 2012, Minister of Industrial Renewal in the Ayrault government.

38,"Marie-Ségolène Royal (French: [seɡɔlɛn ʁwajal] ; born 22 September 1953) is a French politician who was the Socialist Party candidate for the Presidency of France in the 2007 election.
Royal was president of the Poitou-Charentes Regional Council from 2004 to 2014. She won the 2006 Socialist Party primary, becoming the first woman in France to be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major party. In the subsequent 2007 presidential election, she earned further distinction as the first woman to qualify for the second round of a presidential election, but ultimately lost to Nicolas Sarkozy.
In 2008, Royal narrowly lost to Martine Aubry in the Socialist Party's election for First Secretary at the Party's twenty-second national congress. She lost the Socialist Party presidential primary in 2011, and failed in an attempt to win a seat in the National Assembly in the June 2012 parliamentary elections.
She has four children with François Hollande, the former president, and was appointed by him to the vice-chair directorship of the Banque Publique d'Investissement (BPI) in 2013. She served as Minister for Ecology from 2014 to 2017, in the Valls, then Cazeneuve cabinets.


== Early life ==
Marie-Ségolène Royal was born on 22 September 1953 in the military base of Ouakam, Dakar, French West Africa (now Senegal), the daughter of Hélène Dehaye and Jacques Royal, a former artillery officer and aide to the mayor of Chamagne (Vosges). Her parents had eight children in nine years: Marie-Odette, Marie-Nicole, Gérard, Marie-Ségolène, Antoine, Paul, Henri and Sigisbert.
After secondary school in the small town of Melle, Deux-Sèvres, Marie-Ségolène attended a local university where she graduated 2nd in her class with a degree in economics. Her eldest sister then suggested she prepare the entrance exam to the elite Institut d'études politiques de Paris popularly called Sciences Po, which she attended on scholarship. There she discovered politics of class and feminism (""Sciences Po"" at the time was 85% upper-class Parisian, mostly male).In 1972, at the age of 19, Royal sued her father because he refused to divorce her mother and pay alimony and child support to finance the children's education. She won the case after many years in court, shortly before Jacques Royal died of lung cancer in 1981. Six of the eight children had refused to see him again, Ségolène included.Royal, like the majority of France's political elite, is a graduate of the École nationale d'administration. She was in the same class as her former partner of 30 years, François Hollande, as well as Dominique de Villepin (prime minister under Jacques Chirac). Each class year at the ENA receives a nickname to distinguish it: Royal tried to get her peers to name their class after Louise Michel, a revolutionary from the 1870s, but they chose the name ""Voltaire"" instead. During her time at the ENA, Royal also dropped ""Marie"" from her hyphenated first name.


== Political career ==


=== Beginnings ===
After graduating in 1980, she elected to serve as a judge (conseiller) of an administrative court before she was noticed by President François Mitterrand's special adviser Jacques Attali and recruited to his staff in 1982. She held the junior rank of chargée de mission from 1982 to 1988.


=== Member of the French National Assembly ===
She decided to become a candidate for the 1988 legislative election; she registered in the rural, Western Deux-Sèvres Département. Her candidacy was an example of the French political tradition of parachutage (parachuting), appointing promising ""Parisian"" political staffers as candidates in provincial districts to test their mettle. She was up against an entrenched UDF incumbent, and Mitterrand is said to have told her: ""You will not win, but you will next time."" Straddling strongly Catholic and Protestant areas, that district had been held by conservatives since World War II.
She did win against the odds, and remarked: ""Pour un parachutage, l'atterrissage est réussi."" (""As far as parachuting goes, the landing was a success"").After this election, she served as representative in the National Assembly for the Deux-Sèvres' 2nd constituency (1988–1992, 1993–1997, 2002–2007).


=== Minister ===
Minister of Environment : 1992–1993.
Minister of School Education : 1997–2000.
Minister of Family and Children : 2000–2001.
Minister of Family, Children and Disabled persons : 2001–2002.


=== President of the region Poitou-Charentes ===
On 28 March 2004, she obtained 55% in the second round in the regional election in Poitou-Charentes, notably defeating Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's protégée, Élisabeth Morin, in his home region. She was elected president of the region the next week. She kept her National Assembly seat until June 2007, when she chose not to run in the legislative election, in agreement with one of her presidential campaign's promises. She organised a run-off between two contenders; the winner, Delphine Batho, went on to win the district for her and Royal's party.


=== 2007 presidential candidacy ===

On 22 September 2005, Paris Match published an interview in which she declared that she was considering running for the presidency in 2007. In 2006 the CPE (first employment contract) laws were proposed with large protests as a result. Rather than going to the organised protest, she voted a law in her ""région"" whereby no company using that type of contract would receive the Région's subsidies. The government backed down and stated that the law would be put on the statute book, but that it would not be applied. After this event Royal was tipped as the lead contender in what is dubbed the ""Sarko-Ségo"" race against Nicolas Sarkozy.By the beginning of September 2006, her intentions had become quite clear. She has said that only widespread sexism in the Socialist Party had prevented it from rallying around her candidacy as it would have had she been a man. She announced an official team to promote her campaign on 30 August. At this point, polls showed her to be much more popular than her closest competitor, former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and other Socialist heavyweights Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, another former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and François Hollande.
Her status as a presidential candidate became more likely on 28 September 2006, when Lionel Jospin, the Socialist former Prime Minister and a fixture in French politics for nearly three decades, announced that he would not run after all. Jack Lang followed suit. On 16 November, Royal defeated Laurent Fabius and Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the French Socialist Party primary, becoming the party's candidate for the 2007 presidential election. The Socialist party's members voted 60.69% for her and gave a bit under 20% each to the more traditional contenders. She also won in 101 of 104 of the Socialist Party's fédérations, losing only Haute-Corse, Mayotte and Seine-Maritime (the latter being the home region of Laurent Fabius).
One of her top advisors, Éric Besson, resigned soon afterwards over a disagreement about the costs of this programme, which he believes could reach €35 billion, while others in the campaign team wanted to delay bringing out that figure.[The figure was equivalent to that of Mr. Sarkozy's but higher than Mr. Bayrou's, who was becoming a key figure in the race.] This led to an unusually bitter fall-out, and Mr Besson writing a book titled Qui connaît Madame Royal ? (Who knows Mrs Royal?), published on 20 March. In it, Besson accuses Royal of being a populist, an authoritarian and a luddite and says that he will not vote for her and hopes that she is not elected. He then went on to join the Sarkozy campaign and was rewarded with a junior position in the next government on 18 May 2007.
Following the first round of the presidential election, she faced Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round of voting on 6 May in a two-way runoff.
In the final round of voting on Sunday, 6 May, Sarkozy won the presidency with 53% of the vote. Royal conceded defeat and wished Sarkozy the best, requesting he keep her supporters in mind.
Royal later revealed she had offered defeated centrist candidate, François Bayrou, the premiership should she be elected.


=== 2008 Socialist Party leadership election ===

Royal entered the leadership election of the Socialist Party to replace her former common law husband François Hollande as head of the party. She garnered the largest plurality of votes in the first round of voting, but not enough to win outright; she was eventually narrowly defeated in the second round by rival Martine Aubry by the margin of 42 votes. After a vote recount, Aubry was declared the winner 25 November 2008, with the margin widening to 102 votes. Royal has announced her intentions to contest the result. Royal has blamed party leaders and her former partner for her loss in the 2007 election.


=== 2011 Socialist Party presidential primary ===

Royal ran in the French Socialist Party presidential primary election of 2011, the party's first ever open primary.  She arrived 4th in the first round on 9 October 2011 with a mere 6.95% of votes, considerably below the figures suggested by opinion polls.


=== Defeat in the 2012 legislative election ===
In 2012, Royal ran for office representing Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency.  She lost the election to a dissident Socialist, Olivier Falorni.After her separation with Hollande, political relations between them were tense, though they have both stated that they remained friends. In the 2008 Socialist Party leadership election, Hollande backed another candidate, and Royal has blamed him and the party establishment for her 2007 Presidential defeat.


=== 2014 return to government ===
On 2 April 2014 Royal was appointed Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the second cabinet of Prime Minister Manuel Valls, In January 2015 she was third in line in governmental rank, after the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
Increasingly, commentators have seen Royal as President François Hollande’s stand-in for some important state occasions. When Pope Francis touched down on French soil for the first time in his papacy with a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2014, Royal was the senior French official there to greet him. After the deadly attacks against a satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket in January 2015, she travelled to Israel to represent France at the memorial services.
In 2016 Royal promised to install 1,000 km of 'solar roadways' in the next five years. One kilometre was installed in Normandie, and after producing about a quarter of the power predicted, was mostly torn up inside three years.


=== 2017–2020: Ambassador for the Arctic and Antarctic ===
When Emmanuel Macron was elected French President in May 2017, Royal hoped to be offered a position in his government but instead was offered the position of Ambassador for the Poles, which she accepted in June 2017.  In late 2018 the publication of Royal's book ""Ce que je peux enfin vous dire"" (What I can finally tell you) detailing the sexism she had suffered throughout her political career, coincided with a decline in Macron's popularity at the time of the Gilets jaunes protests and resulted in speculation that Royal was contemplating a political comeback. After repeatedly and publicly criticising Macron's handling of pension reform, it was announced by the Council of Ministers that the Mission to the Poles would be ended, effectively removing Royal from her position, in tandem with an official investigation being launched inquiring about alleged misuse of public funds during Royal's time in office.


== Policies ==
Royal has tended to campaign on family and other socially-oriented issues, rather than on economic or foreign policy issues. For instance, she has mounted campaigns against the exposure of children to violent television shows, including cartoons (see her 1989 book, listed below, Le Ras-le-bol des bébés zappeurs, roughly translated as ""The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed Up""), and more generally has taken a stand on several issues regarding family values and the protection of children.
Royal stated as part of her 100-point platform that if elected, she would raise the lowest state pensions by five per cent, increase the monthly minimum wage to €1,500, raise benefits of handicapped citizens, implement state-paid rental deposits for the poorest citizens, and guarantee a job or job training to every student within six months of graduation. She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She pledged free contraception for all young women and a €10,000 interest-free loan for all young people.


=== Economy ===
The capitalists and the socialists have to be frightened. There is no alternative. They can't just dispose of people as they wish. They have to be held accountable.
Royal opposes movements of jobs between EU countries and outsourcing to developing countries.  She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She did not directly address whether additional taxes would need to be raised to fund these programs, stating that they can be paid for by cutting waste in government.
She was appointed to the vice-chair directorship of the Banque Publique d'Investissement, from which position she stated that the ""BPI's purpose is not to do business nor to make profits"".


=== Environment ===
The Socialist Party website states that during her tenure as Minister for the Environment, 1992–1993, Royal campaigned actively and successfully for the ""Law on the treatment and recycling of Waste"" (La loi sur le traitement et le recyclage des déchets), the ""Law to preserve the countryside"" (La loi sur la reconquête des paysages), a ""Save our countrysides, savour their products"" campaign to provide proper labelling for the products of 100 local areas (opération ""Sauvons nos paysages, savourons leurs produits""), and the ""Law against noise pollution"" (La loi de lutte contre le bruit). She provided compensation for people adversely affected by airport noise.


=== Education ===
During her tenure as Minister-delegate for the Family, Children, and the Handicapped, 2000–2002, Royal was active in the re-launch of the Priority Education Zones program (ZEP / zone d'éducation prioritaire), the creation of a government student lunch program, the implementation of language instruction as a priority in primary schools, the creation of a national home-tutoring program, Heures de Soutien Scolaire, and the creation of programs for parental involvement in schools, ""la Semaine des parents à l'école"", and national campaigns for the elections of parent-representatives. She also campaigned for the creation of local education and citizenship education contracts, the ""Initiatives citoyennes"" program for teaching children how to live together, the law on ""Defense of children's rights and campaign against violence in the schools"" (Loi de juin 1998 relative à la prévention et à la répression des infractions sexuelles ainsi qu'à la protection des mineurs), the ""Campaign against hazing rituals in higher education"" (Loi de juin 1998 contre le bizutage), the ""Campaign against violence and racketeering"" which included implementation of the ""SOS Violence"" telephone number, and the implementation of mandatory civics instruction in secondary schools.In January 2006, she criticised secondary school teachers (workers of state public service) who give private lessons outside school hours, saying that they should spend more time in school. When a bootleg video of the speech surfaced on the Internet in November 2006, the teachers' union SNES rebuffed her, requesting that she renounce her proposal.


=== Family and social affairs ===
In 1989, Royal wrote The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed-Up, a book in which she criticised Japanese animation (then dominant in certain TV programs) as poor quality production detrimental for children.
Royal favours, and has worked for, the ""Parental rights and obligations act"" (Loi sur l'autorité parentale), the ""Women's rights reform and anonymous childbirth act"" (l'accouchement sous X), the creation of paternity leave, the creation of 40,000 new spaces in French nursery schools, and Social housing reform. She has been active in campaigns providing for ""Parental time-off provisions and financial support for child illness care"", Special education support (parents d'enfants handicapés), ""Benefit allocations for students starting the new school year"" (Allocation de rentrée scolaire), and the ""Prostitution of Minors Act"" (Loi contre la prostitution des mineurs) which provides penal measures for clients. Royal has supported the ""Law against child pornography"", the creation of the association ""Childhood and the Media"" (Enfance et média) against violence in the media, the creation of the Plan Handiscole for the education of handicapped children and adolescents and their integration into life at school, programs for mass and individual transportation, and the creation of the program ""Tourism and the Handicapped"" (Tourisme et handicap).
In 2009, she declared herself to be ""profoundly shocked"" by statements of Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that the distribution of condoms will not stop the spread of AIDS. Royal added that ""the responsibility of any religious leader"" is to ""defend the principle of life, and certainly not to urge human beings towards their deaths.""When she accepted her nomination as the Socialist presidential candidate, Royal said: ""There is a strong correlation between the status of a woman and the state of justice or injustice in a country."" According to an article in Ms. magazine, French women currently earn 80% of a male counterpart's salary.Royal has been a long-standing critic of violence on television. She has voiced opinions in the past linking youth crime to exposure to pornography and television violence.
She also described the M6 programme Loft Story, imitating the internationally popular Big Brother TV series, as contrary to principles of human dignity and risking transforming viewers into voyeurs instead of providing quality programming.A law passed in February 2002, introduced by Royal on behalf of the Jospin government, allows some parental authority to be granted to same-sex partners. The law amended Article 377 of the Civil Code in allowing a parent to ask a judge to share his/her parental authority with a partner. Article 377–1, added by the law, ensures that ""delegation may provide, for the needs of education of a child, that the father and mother, or one of them, shall share all or part of the exercise of parental authority with the third person delegatee"".In a June 2006 interview with LGBT publication Têtu, Royal said ""opening up marriage to same-sex couples is needed in the name of equality, visibility and respect"" and said that if her party formed the next government she would introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption.According to her 2007 campaign website, Royal has advocated a policy of more humane prisons and supports creating better conditions inside penal institutions. The website states that she supports a system of rehabilitating offenders and reintegrating them into society.


== Foreign policy ==
Royal initially appeared to have few opinions on key subjects, such as the accession of Turkey to the European Union, merely responding, ""my opinion is that of the French people."" On the subject of the Iranian nuclear program, Royal also took conflicting positions. She initially took a very hard line in a televised debate, contending that any nuclear power programme in Iran must be prevented since it would inevitably lead to weapons production. When she was criticised by French politicians for not understanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – which gives signatories the right to nuclear power for non-military purposes – Royal softened her position and, through a spokesman, said that a civil nuclear program should be allowed as long as UN inspectors were permitted to conduct spot checks.


=== International tours ===


==== Middle East ====
In early December 2006, controversy followed a brief tour of the Middle East. Meeting Hezbollah politician Ali Ammar, she took exception to his use of the euphemism ""Zionist entity"", but did not take issue with his comparison of the Palestinian territories to France under German occupation during World War II. This attracted criticism in France and in Israel which Royal visited next. However, the French ambassador to Lebanon, Bernard Emié, backed her explanation that she did not hear ""the offending remarks"" – the discussion took place via an interpreter supplied by the Lebanese parliament. In the same visit, Royal thanked the minister for being so ""frank"" when he described US foreign policy in the Middle East as ""unlimited American insanity"".


==== China ====
Royal visited China in January 2007; after speaking with a lawyer in that country she noted to the press that he had pointed out to her that the Chinese legal system was ""faster"" than the French one. She was immediately reminded by her opponents at home that the Chinese system orders 10,000 executions each year, and that defence lawyers there must be authorised by the Communist Party. She however brought up with her hosts the fate of three Chinese journalists recently imprisoned, and criticised the ""meekness"" of French entrepreneurs in tackling new markets such as China. Royal was criticised by French and international media by what was called ""mangling the French language"" in a soundbite delivered on the Great Wall of China. She used the word bravitude instead of the word bravoure, which means bravery.


==== Canada: Support for the Quebec independence movement ====
In January 2007, during a meeting with Quebec opposition leader and Parti Québécois head André Boisclair, she declared her support for the Quebec sovereignty movement in its aim to secede from Canada. Royal said Quebec and France share common values, including ""sovereignty and Quebec's freedom"". Soon after, Royal took a phone call from comedian Gérald Dahan pretending to be Quebec Premier Jean Charest, and was tricked into making a quip about Corsica's independence: ""Not all French people would be opposed."" She then added, ""But don't repeat that or we'll have another scandal on our hands.""


==== On Afghanistan ====
On 5 April 2007, when commenting on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen by the Taliban in Afghanistan, Royal called for sanctions to be imposed by the United Nations against regimes like the Taliban. This comment was widely interpreted as indicating that Royal did not understand that the Taliban no longer formed the Afghan government and that she was clueless on international matters.


==== Ukraine: Russian support ====
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Royal repeatedly supported the Russian view that NATO was to blame for the war, and falsely claimed that the Mariupol hospital airstrike and the Bucha massacre never happened. According to her, the events were ""war propaganda"" promoted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to interrupt the peace process. Royal's claims were condemned by Olivier Faure, the leader of Royal's Socialist Party, and Raphaël Glucksmann, its leader in the European Parliament.


==== Hijacking 'Africa-led' clean energy scheme ====
On 30 April 2017, Youba Sokona resigned from the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, citing “European interference [to impose EU-preferred projects] in African governance that belongs to another era.”  Reports surfaced directly accusing Ségolène Royal of undermining African leadership. The initiative was scrapped in 2017.


== Personal life ==
From the late 1970s, Royal was the partner of François Hollande, former President of France, whom she met at ENA. The couple had four children: Thomas (born 1984), Clémence (born 1985), Julien (born 1987) and Flora (born 1992). They were neither married (considering it too ""bourgeois"") nor bound by a PACS (pacte civil de solidarité, which provides for a civil union between two adults, regardless of gender), contrary to rumours. A news agency leaked news of their separation in June 2007, on the evening of the legislative election. According to the Guardian, she had asked Hollande ""to move out of the house"" and pursue his new love interest ""which has been detailed in books and newspapers"" – a reference to a much-discussed chapter by journalists explaining how Hollande was having a long-term affair with a journalist.Royal's eldest son, Thomas Hollande, served as an adviser to her during her presidential candidacy, working on a website designed to appeal to young voters.Her brother Antoine named their brother Gérard Royal as the agent who placed the bomb that sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior. But other sources claim that this statement is exaggerated and that Gérard was part of the logistics team.Royal's cousin Anne-Christine Royal followed the paternal side of the family and has been a candidate of the far-right Front National party at a local election in Bordeaux.Royal was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50 by The Guardian in March 2013.

A member of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) until 2008 when she joined the Democratic Movement (MoDem), de Sarnez was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until her appointment as Minister for European Affairs in the Phillipe government in 2017. De Sarnez resigned after a month due to a scandal involving alleged payment for work she did not perform, but was elected a few days later to represent the 11th constituency of Paris in the National Assembly. She was a committed Europeanist and centrist, pushing the MoDem to resist currents on each end of the political spectrum. De Sarnez was a longtime collaborator to party president and three-time candidate for the presidency of France, François Bayrou.

She was involved in the Presidential campaign the next year, creating popular ""Giscard à la barre"" (""Giscard at the helm”) t-shirts. Giscard d'Estaing was elected and de Sarnez rose quickly through the ranks. Later de Sarnez grew disappointed by the rightward turn, especially the anti-abortion politics, that the new administration adopted, and wished Giscard d'Estaing had taken the opportunity to break from the right-wing UDR (predecessor to the Rally for the Republic, RPR) and form a majority government without them. Failure to do so, she later said, left the Giscardians ""hostages"" to the right. Simone Veil offered de Sarnez a slot on her list for the European elections in 1979 (when Veil became president of the European Parliament). De Sarnez, who had a ten-month-old daughter and a son on the way, declined at that time, later saying she was glad to have waited for a more compatible political partner.Giscard d'Estaing was defeated in the 1981 French presidential election. De Sarnez later said that despite personal disappointment, she did not entirely regret the political changes brought by President François Mitterrand, of the Socialist Party (PS).


=== Work with François Bayrou ===
In 1978, de Sarnez co-founded the Union for French Democracy (UDF), aimed at developing a center-right coalition to back Giscard d'Estaing and provide a counterweight to the Gaullist right. From 1986 to 1989, she served as special advisor to the chair of the UDF group in the National Assembly, Jean-Claude Gaudin.In this milieu she met François Bayrou, with whom she worked closely for the next 40 years. The two became close working on Raymond Barre's campaign for President in 1988 and were soon inseparable. ""Elle, c'est moi, et moi, c'est elle"" (""I'm her and she is me"") he told those who occasionally tried to drive a wedge between them. When Bayrou became Secretary General of the UDF in 1989, she joined him as his deputy, then likewise at the Ministry of National Education (1993 to 1997) in the government of Alain Juppé. Initially she was an adviser, but then became Director of his Private Office, the first French woman to hold such a senior role without a degree from the École nationale d'administration. From 1997 to 1998, she was the secretary-general of the UDF group in the National Assembly. After the Plural Left won the 1997 legislative elections, in 1989 through 1993 de Sarnez became Secretary-General of the opposition general assembly, while Bayrou was President of UDF. She went on to become national secretary of the UDF, from 2003 to 2007.De Sarnez, who earned a reputation as an outstanding organizer—Raffarin described her as a ""gifted politician""—also served as campaign manager for Bayrou's 2007 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Each time, Bayrou, a center-right candidate running under the UDF banner, failed to advance to the second (final) round. In 2002, they earned 6.84% of the first-round vote, a fourth-place finish while the neo-Gaullist right-wing (RPR) and extreme-right (National Front, FN) candidates Jacques Chirac and Jean-Marie Le Pen, respectively, advanced. Along with much of the political establishment, Bayrou threw his support behind Chirac. In 2007, it was 18.57% (Nicolas Sarkozy, a right-wing candidate then running with the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Ségolène Royal advanced) and 9.13% in 2012 (Sarkozy and PS candidate François Hollande advanced). The 2007 election loss nevertheless marked a significant turning point, as Bayrou announced publicly he would not vote for Sarkozy, breaking from the dominant right-wing UMP to form the centrist Democratic Movement (MoDem). De Sarnez became its First Vice-President. The UMP's successor the Republicans (LR) blamed Bayrou (and retaliated) for Sarkozy's loss and a number of UDF members split to create the New Centre party to support Sarkozy, leaving only three MoDem deputies in the National Assembly, including Bayrou, not enough to form their own group in the legislature. Ex-comrades accused de Sarnez of having creating a vacuum around Bayrou. A 2007 profile in Le Monde describes de Sarnez's role with Bayrou: ""Nothing is done without her consent.""In the 2016 presidential primary held by LR, de Sarnez endorsed Alain Juppé over Sarkozy, but both lost in a surprise upset by François Fillon. Bayrou, in consultation with de Sarnez, decided not to run in the 2017 French presidential election and they both instead supported Emmanuel Macron of La République En Marche! as an alternative centrist candidate, ultimately successful.


=== Role in Europe ===
While de Sarnez made her name as ""the woman who made Bayrou"", he also encouraged her to strike out as a candidate herself, insisting, ""She's not a number two. She's a number one."" Devoted to the cause of a unified Europe, she began her elected career in 1999 as a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Île-de-France, heading the UDF list in 2004 and serving until 2017. A member of the UDF before 2008 and MoDem after 2008, de Sarnez served as vice-chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and sat on the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education. She was in the forefront for Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and it inspired the choice to make orange the signature color of MoDem. She also took a particular interest in the EU's Erasmus Mundus, expanding on the popular Erasmus program to create opportunities for students outside Europe to study in its universities as well. In the contentious 2005 French referendum on ratifying the European Constitution, de Sarnez supported ratification. Although the measure failed, de Sarnez praised the ""democratic moment"" of the entire nation reading and debating the text. In 2009, she published a short book called Petit dictionnaire pour faire aimer l'Europe (A Brief Dictionary for Loving Europe). The book covers 80-odd subjects in 250 pages, appealing to a vision of Europe that centers equity in its relationship with the rest of the world.De Sarnez was a substitute for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a member of the delegation for relations with South Africa, and a substitute for the delegation to the EU–Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee. In 2016, she served as the parliament's rapporteur on a plan to lend Tunisia €500 million on favourable terms to help it reduce its external debt and consolidate its democratic mechanisms. In addition to her committee assignments, de Sarnez was a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Children's Rights.In May 2017, de Sarnez left the European Parliament upon her appointment as French Minister for European Affairs. Reporting from Le Canard enchaîné shortly thereafter alleged that de Sarnez had been paid for work she had not actually done, embroiling her and Bayrou in a jobs scandal. Prosecutors opened an investigation into whether assistants to de Sarnez as an MEP had actually been paid for work done for the MoDem party in Paris. Both she and Bayrou (the new Minister of Justice) resigned, just before the 2017 legislative election in which de Sarnez was a candidate with Emmanuel Macron's newly formed party, La République En Marche! Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced that Bayrou would not be a part of the government. On 21 June 2017, Nathalie Loiseau succeeded de Sarnez as the minister for European affairs.


=== Representative of Paris ===
Despite the timing of the scandal, de Sarnez, who was also a councillor (joint RPR-UDF slate) for the 14th arrondissement of Paris from 2001 to 2010 and from 2014 to 2020, was elected Deputy to the National Assembly for the 11th constituency of Paris on 18 June 2017.De Sarnez became chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving in that capacity from 2017 to 2021. 
On 24 April 2018, De Sarnez was among the guests invited to the state dinner hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump in honor of President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.On 31 May 2019, she led a delegation of the committee on a visit to the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria and the Syrian Democratic Council in Ayn Issa. After de Sarnez’s death in 2021, she was succeeded as deputy by Maud Gatel.


== Personal life ==
De Sarnez married Philippe Augier (later Mayor of Deauville) and had two children, circa 1979. She separated from Augier in 1988. A private person, de Sarnez kept a small circle of friends and strictly enforced her preference that her personal life stay out of the media spotlight. She was known for her uniform of jeans and Converse sneakers.De Sarnez died of leukemia in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris on 13 January 2021, at age 69. French leaders across the political spectrum sent public messages mourning her death, including President Macron and his rivals in the 2017 election, extreme-right FN candidate Marine Le Pen and hard left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon; as well as current Prime Minister Jean Castex and de Sarnez's longtime professional partner Bayrou. The National Assembly observed a minute of silence and Le Monde wrote, ""One of the pillars of the house of centrism has fallen.""

76,"Christiane Marie Taubira (French: [kʁistjan maʁi tobiʁa]; born 2 February 1952) is a French politician who served as Minister of Justice of France in the governments of Prime Ministers Jean-Marc Ayrault and Manuel Valls under President François Hollande from 2012 until 2016. She was a member of the National Assembly of France for French Guiana from 1993 to 2012 and member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1999.
She won the 2022 French People's Primary, winning the right to stand as a ""unity left"" candidate in the 2022 French presidential election. It was her second bid after the 2002 French presidential election where she failed to qualify to the second round after garnering only 2.32% of the votes in the first round. She dropped out of the race on 2 March 2022 after failing to get enough support to qualify.


== Early life ==
Taubira was born on 2 February 1952 in Cayenne, French Guiana, France, as one of 11 siblings and raised by a single mother. Among others, she is the sister of French politician Jean-Marie Taubira, Secretary General of the Guianese Progressive Party.
Taubira studied economics at Panthéon-Assas University, African American ethnology, sociology at Paris-Sorbonne University and food industry at the French Center for Agricultural Cooperation.


== Political career ==


=== Early beginnings ===
Having served as President of the Walwari Party, Taubira from 1993 served as a Deputy to the French National Assembly, being re-elected in 1997. Non-affiliated in 1993, she then voted in favour of the conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to form a Cabinet of ministers in 1993.


=== Member of the European Parliament, 1994–1999 ===
In the 1994 European elections Taubira became a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), being the fourth on the Énergie Radicale list led by Bernard Tapie. In parliament, she served on the Committee on Development (1994-1997) and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media (1997-1999). In addition to her committee assignments, she was part of the parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of South America.In June 1997 Taubira joined the Socialist Party (PS), and then-Prime Minister Lionel Jospin appointed her to head a government commission into gold mining in Guiana.


=== Career in national politics ===
Taubira was the driving force behind a 21 May 2001 law that recognised the Atlantic slave trade and slavery as a crime against humanity.In 2002 Taubira was a Left Radical Party (PRG) candidate for the Presidency although she did not belong to the Party; she won 2.32% of the votes. After 2002 she became the party's vice-president. She was elected as its Deputy in the 2002 elections and chose to join the Socialists' group in the Assembly.
In the Socialist Party's 2011 primaries, Taubira endorsed Arnaud Montebourg as the party's candidate for the 2012 presidential election.In addition to her work in national politics Taubira served as a Regional Councillor of French Guiana from 2010 until 2012.


=== Minister of Justice, 2012–2016 ===
Taubira was nominated Minister of Justice by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, following the victory of François Hollande in the 2012 elections. At the time, she was one of the few black, female politicians within a prominent ministry in the French government. She soon emerged as one of the most outspoken and progressive voices in the government.Taubira was initially supposed to work with Junior Minister Delphine Batho. However, their relationship quickly broke down being unable to share responsibilities. After the June 2012 Legislative elections, Batho was moved to become Minister of Ecology replacing Nicole Bricq, leaving Taubira in charge of the Ministry of Justice. She resigned her position as Minister of Justice on 27 January 2016 after a disagreement with President Hollande over policies related to the treatment of French Nationals convicted of terrorism.In 2013, Taubira voiced her support for land reforms in France's Caribbean territories as compensation for slavery. She also formally implemented an important electoral promise of François Hollande and introduced Law 2013-404, which legalised same-sex marriage in France.
In 2014 Taubira successfully defied opposition parties' calls for her to quit after it emerged that she knew former President Nicolas Sarkozy's phone was being tapped, apparently contradicting an earlier statement from her. She reportedly considered resigning in August 2014, along with other left-wing cabinet members such as Arnaud Montebourg, in protest against Hollande's economic policies.Taubira resigned in January 2016 after openly disagreeing with the French president's proposal to strip French nationality from dual-citizens convicted of terrorism, a measure championed by Hollande in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook Paris on 13 November; Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls had taken charge of the constitutional reform draft law, which would normally have been part of her portfolio. One week later, she published Murmures à la jeunesse, a book about this proposal.


=== Later career ===
Despite being urged to join the race by supporters, Taubira chose not to run in the Socialist Party's 2017 presidential primary, and remained neutral in the contest; following his nomination Taubira later endorsed Benoît Hamon as the party's candidate for the 2017 French presidential election. In the second round of the presidential election she called on voters to rally behind Emmanuel Macron.Taubira formally announced her candidacy for the 2022 presidential election in January 2022  and won the ""people's primary"" intended to select a consensus left-wing candidate. By March 2022, the Constitutional Council published data showing Taubira had failed to win enough endorsements from elected officials to qualify for the presidential election.


== Political views ==


=== Immigration ===
Taubira is a vocal critic of illegal immigration to French Guiana. In 2007 Taubira stated that ""We are at an identity turning point. The ethnic Guyanese have become a minority on their own land"" as a result of illegal immigration. In recent years Taubira has called for solidarity with refugees in Metropolitan France.


== Victim of racist attacks ==
Like other female ministers Taubira has faced many racist and sexist insults.Taubira allowed the Guyanese political party Walwari to make a direct citation in the Cayenne criminal court against Anne-Sophie Leclère, a candidate for the Front National who in October 2013 shared a racist cartoon comparing Taubira to a monkey on her Facebook page. Leclère was sentenced to nine months in prison and five years of ineligibility by the court before the judgement was quashed on appeal as Walwari's actions were deemed invalid.In September 2016 the Paris criminal court, which had opened an investigation when the facts were revealed, found Leclère guilty of the crime of public insult and sentenced her to a suspended fine of 3,000 euros.
In November 2013 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the comments, which it considered as racist attacks against Taubira, in particular those on the cover of the extreme right-wing weekly Minute, which featured her photo with the caption: ""Clever as a monkey, Taubira finds the banana"". The weekly rejected the accusation of racism, arguing that it merely used two French expressions, ""the second of which - the part about the banana - is familiarly used to describe a person in good shape"". The minister denounced comments of ""extreme violence"", denying her ""belonging to the human race"". The weekly's editor was sentenced to a fine of 10,000 euros for its front page on 30 October 2014. The public prosecutor's office appealed against the fine, saying that it was too lenient.


== Honours ==
In 2016, Taubira received a honorary doctorate in Laws and Human Rights from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (USA).
On 26 September 2016, she was awarded the Sash rank of the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the then president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
She was awarded a honorary doctorate (dr.h.c.) in Law from the University of Geneva (Switzerland) on 9 October 2020.
In 2018, Taubira furthermore received a honorary doctorate (DHC) from the Free University of Brussels (Belgium) for her defence of diversity as France’s Minister of Justice under President François Hollande.


== Personal life ==
Taubira has been married twice. She has four children with her second husband, Roland Delannon. They are divorced. Delannon is a separatist politician who founded the Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement; he was jailed for 18 months for planning to blow up an oil and gas facility in the 1980s.
