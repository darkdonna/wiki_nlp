0,"Sviatlana Hieorhiyeuna Tsikhanouskaya (née Pilipchuk; born 11 September 1982) is a Belarusian political activist. After standing as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election against the president Alexander Lukashenko, she has led the political opposition to his authoritarian rule through an oppositional government operating from Lithuania and Poland.
Tsikhanouskaya became an opposition leader after her husband, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, ran as a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential election. He was arrested, along with most other opposition leaders, and, as she was unable to file for the presidency on his behalf, Tsikhanouskaya entered herself into the race as a candidate. Lukashenko allowed her candidacy because he believed that a woman could not form legitimate opposition. She ran on a platform of constitutional reform, seeking free and fair elections with term limits on the presidency, and she pledged to step down once this was implemented. After Lukashenko was declared the victor, she was held by Belarusian authorities and then forced into exile in Lithuania. Election observers consider the election fraudulent, and Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate head of state of Belarus. 
Since fleeing to Lithuania, Tsikhanouskaya has established an oppositional government. She established the Coordination Council in 2020 and the United Transitional Cabinet in 2022. As a representative of a democratic Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya has met with several world leaders in a diplomatic capacity to negotiate sanctions against Lukashenko's government and to deny him recognition as a legitimate head of state. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she has been an advocate of increased Western support for Ukraine, while also warning that Russia's actions should not overshadow opposition to the dictatorship in Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya was tried in absentia by the Belarusian government in 2023 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.


== Early life ==
Sviatlana Pilipchuk was born on 11 September 1982 in the village of Mikashevichy to Hieorhij Ivanavič and Valancina Mikałajeuna Pilipčuk. Her father was a driver at a concrete factory, and her mother was a cafeteria cook. She grew up in a Soviet prefabricated apartment building, where she spent much of her time reading. Among her books were some from the United States, which she read to learn English and learn about the world outside of Belarus.Pilipchuk's village was near the Chernobyl exclusion zone. When she was twelve years old, she was taken to Roscrea, Ireland, by the Chernobyl Lifeline charity, which helped children travel so as to reduce their exposure to radiation. Though Pilipchuk was not as affected by radiation as other students, her proficiency in school earned her a spot. While staying in Ireland, she would translate for the other children. Pilipchuk lived with a host family, the Deanes, who effectively became second parents to her. She returned over the following three summers, and she felt that Ireland was a more cheerful place than Belarus. Even after she stopped visiting Ireland, she has stayed in contact with the Deanes in adulthood.Pilipchuk attended Mozyr State Pedagogical University to study teaching. While she was in Mazyr, she met nightclub owner Syarhei Tsikhanouski in 2003. They married in 2004, and she took the name Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Together they had two children: a son and a daughter, about five years apart. Her son was born mostly deaf, and much of her time went to assisting him. She moved from Minsk to Gomel where he could receive treatment, including a cochlear implant. Until 2020, Tsikhanouskaya was an English teacher and interpreter. She retired so she had more time to raise her children. She pulled her children out of school when the COVID-19 pandemic developed, as the government had not taken any prevention measures.


== 2020 Belarusian presidential election ==


=== Background and building a campaign ===
In 2019, Tsikhanouskaya's husband Tsikhanouski started a YouTube channel, ""A Country for Life"", in which he interviewed people and challenged the rule of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. He became a prominent opposition leader through his YouTube and Telegram presence, as well as his organization of political protests. He moved to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, and he was subsequently arrested for his protest activity days before the filing deadline.: 122–123  Tsikhanouskaya attempted to file for her husband by proxy but was rejected. In response, she filed for her own candidacy.: 123  She later said that she did this solely as a show of support for her husband. Tsikhanouskaya registered as an Independent candidate on 14 July 2020.Tsikhanouskaya initially had no interest in building a campaign. When her husband was released, he continued the campaign even though it was her name on the paperwork. He sometimes brought a life-size cutout of Tsikhanouskaya when he campaigned. She easily acquired the 100,000 signatures that were needed to run—a high limit that was expected to block opposition candidates from running. Her candidacy was confirmed on 19 July 2020. From this day, she traveled across Belarus to hold campaign events.Tsikhanouski was arrested a second time, accused of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was later found to be staged. With her husband imprisoned, Tsikhanouskaya became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko in the presidential election,: 123  making her a rare example of an opposition leader in an autocratic nation that arose through a political campaign.: 120  She aligned with Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of opposition candidate Valery Tsepkalo who had fled the country, and Maria Kalesnikava, the campaign manager of opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested.: 123 2020 was a time of political vulnerability for Lukashenko. He had grown more unpopular because of his mishandling of economic issues and his dismissive response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus.: 122  Most opposition candidates were removed from the race, either through arrest or disqualification.: 123  Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy, believing that as a woman she was not a significant political threat. He instead belittled her for being a female political candidate, using sexist language.: 119  Tsikhanouskaya leaned into the feminine aspects of her candidacy, emphasizing that she was a mother, and her gender may have indicated to voters that she was less likely to seek power for herself.: 124 Instead of running as a protest candidate, encouraging a boycott as her husband had intended, she built a campaign. Tsikhanouskaya described herself as an ""accidental candidate"", and she said that she would only hold office until the Lukashenko dictatorship was seen to an end.: 120  Her role in the campaign was to serve as a face for the opposition movement rather than to engage in politics. Her role has been compared to Joan of Arc by the Belarusian press. She said of the campaign that ""every day was full of fear"".


=== Campaigning ===
Though she was running as an independent candidate, Tsikhanouskaya attracted support from across the spectrum of Belarus's political opposition. Vital Rymasheuski, co-leader of Belarusian Christian Democracy, announced his party's support, as did the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Assembly), United Civic Party of Belarus, and Belarusian Women's Party ""Nadzieja"". She also received support from 2010 presidential candidate Mikola Statkevich, and president of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Ivonka Survilla. Tsikhanouskaya's shared experience with the other wives of arrested dissidents earned her many supporters among women.: 124  Rallies in support of Tsikhanouskaya and in opposition to Lukashenko were the largest in the history of post-Soviet Belarus, attracting crowds of 20,000 in Brest and 220,000 in Minsk. Tsikhanouskaya had no political experience, and she had to be taught how to speak to the media. This endeared her to voters and protesters, who saw her as an ordinary citizen like themselves. Her open dislike of politics fueled this response.During the presidential campaign, Tsikhanouskaya was repeatedly threatened, recounting threatening phone calls from unknown numbers, which said, ""We will put you behind bars and place your children in an orphanage"". Tsikhanouskaya said she then decided to persevere in her campaign, saying that ""there must be a symbol of freedom"". Her campaign began as Amnesty International condemned Belarus's discriminatory treatment of women opposition activists, including threats of sexual violence and threats by authorities to take children away from opposition figures and send them to state-run orphanages. Worried for the safety of her children, Tsikhanouskaya had them hidden abroad in Lithuania.Tsikhanouskaya said that she ran for president out of love, to free her husband from prison. She ran on only three political issues: the release of political prisoners, constitutional limitations on the presidency, and new elections. Once these three things happened, she said, she would step down from the presidency. To reform the constitution, she pledged to set a referendum on returning to the original draft of the 1994 Belarusian constitution, reinstating a limit of two terms for the president. She also vowed to move away from the union treaty with Russia. She said that her main goal was to establish free and fair elections. She viewed the election as illegitimate due to the government's refusal to register Lukashenko's main political opponents as candidates. She pledged to deliver a plan for transparent and accountable elections within six months of taking office.Tsikhanouskaya's economic platform emphasized increasing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses in the Belarusian economy. She planned to offer interest free loans to small and medium-sized businesses, cancel state inspections of private entities, and provide legal protection for foreign investors. She planned to allow profitable state owned enterprises to continue to operate, while requiring unprofitable state owned enterprises to take advice from outside professionals.


=== Election day and departure from Belarus ===
The night before the election, police detained senior staffers from Tsikhanouskaya's campaign and she chose to go into hiding in Minsk, before re-emerging on election day at a polling station. When the results were announced, Tsikhanouskaya officially received only ten percent of the vote. Poll workers were required to engage in electoral fraud to ensure Lukashenko's victory over Tsikhanouskaya,: 125  and protests took place across Belarus in response. According to election monitor Golos and independent observers, Tsikhanouskaya was the legitimate winner of the election. After Belarusian state television released an exit poll showed Lukashenko winning by an overwhelming margin, Tsikhanouskaya said that she didn't trust that poll, saying, ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us"".Tsikhanouskaya and her lawyer went to the Central Election Commission the following day, where they were confronted by armed guards, and Tsikhanouskaya was forced to meet with Lukashenko's enforcer Andrei Pavlyuchenko. She was given an ultimatum to either leave the country, or to go to prison and have her children taken. They described to her in detail what life in prison would be like for her, where political prisoners were frequently tortured, and what life for her children would be like as wards of the state. She attempted to negotiate the release of her husband in exchange for ending her challenge and leaving the country. Her offer was refused, but instead she was able to negotiate the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz. Tsikhanouskaya and Moroz prepared to leave for Lithuania; Tsikhanouskaya collected her passport and her son's cochlear implant equipment, while Moroz arranged to have her own children escorted to Lithuania by her sister. The women also demanded that a Belarusian KGB agent escort them to the border in Moroz's car, to prevent the use of a car bomb.A video was released of Tsikhanouskaya conceding to Lukashenko and asking the protesters to stand down. The stark change in demeanor and message led allies to say that the video had been coerced, with some going as far as to liken it to a hostage video.


== Exile ==


=== Establishing an opposition government-in-exile ===
On 11 August 2020, Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius announced that Tsikhanouskaya was safe in Lithuania while also acknowledging that she had ""few options"". She felt that she had ""betrayed"" her supporters by leaving the country. The same day, the State Security Committee of Belarus alleged that an attempt was being made on Tsikhanouskaya's life, saying that the protesters needed a ""sacred sacrifice"".Days after she left the country, Tsikhanouskaya declared herself the ""leader of democratic Belarus"". To this effect, she announced the establishment of a Coordination Council to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko. Applications for membership in the council were open only to Belarusian authority figures, such as respected professionals, authors, or sportspeople. Tsikhanouskaya considered herself to be an ""interim-leader"" of Belarus, but she has not claimed an entitlement to the presidency. She has indicated that she will not seek the presidency again, instead continuing her diplomatic work until fair elections can be held.Tsikhanouskaya appealed to the international community to recognise her as the winner, traveling to various European capitals and meeting with world leaders, including President Joe Biden, Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron, President Ursula von der Leyen, President Charles Michel, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Western nations and the European Parliament have generally opted not to recognise Lukashenko's reelection. She has also sought sanctions against Belarus, speaking with world leaders in an effort to get them applied. After a period of protest, Lukashenko regained de facto control over the nation. Tsikhanouskaya has denied that she leads a government in exile, saying that she wished to create a ""permanent opposition inside Belarus"". The nation of Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate leader of Belarus.On 9 August 2022, at a conference held in Vilnius, Tsikhanouskaya announced the creation of the United Transitional Cabinet. It initially consisted of Pavel Latushko (responsible for the transition of power), Aliaksandr Azarau (responsible for the restoration of law and order), Valery Kavaleuski (foreign affairs), and Valery Sakhashchyk (defense and national security). Belarus declared Tsikhanouskaya's organizations to be extremist formations in January 2023, making her subject to prison time should she be captured by the Belarusian government. Two months later, she was tried in absentia and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.European Parliament and a number of governments recognize Tsikhanouskaya and her structures as legitimate representative of the Republic of Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya is often referred by foreign government representatives, diplomats and parliamentarians as ""President"", ""President-elect"", ""Leader of Democratic Belarus"", while her Cabinet is referred as ""government in exile.""The Council of Europe, the European Union and the United States of America have established the formal cooperation with the structures of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.


=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

When the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, Tsikhanouskaya sought to promote the anti-war movement in Belarus.: 125  She has objected to the international framing of Belarus as merely a vassal state of Russia, alleging that it downplays the severity of Lukashenko's rule. Regarding Lukashenko's support of the invasion, Tsikhanouskaya accused him of treason.Following Belarus's entry into the war, Tsikhanouskaya and her supporters developed the Pieramoha Plan (Victory Plan), a strategy involving underground dissidents in Belarus, engaging in information sharing and sabotage. She has said that the dissidents must wait until ""the right moment"", when instability allows for a change in power.Tsikhanouskaya argues that the existence of a dictatorship in Belarus threatens the safety not only of Ukraine, but of the other states bordering Belarus: Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as Belarus has been used by Russia to attack neighboring countries like Ukraine. She supports continued political and economic involvement by the West in support of Ukraine's efforts in the Russo-Ukrainian War. She has warned of war fatigue stymieing Western support for Ukraine and Belarusian dissidents.


== Awards ==
Tsikhanouskaya was on the 2020 list of the BBC's 100 Women, announced on 23 November 2020, and was included in the 2020 edition of The Bloomberg 50. Tsikhanouskaya and other Belarusian opposition leaders were awarded the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in a ceremony on 16 December in Brussels. Among dozens of distinctions, she is a recipient of the 2020 Globsec prize for freedom; 2022 International Four Freedoms Award; 2022 International Trailblazer Award; 2022 Tipperary International Peace Award, 2023 IDU Bush-Thatcher Award for Freedom; 2023 NATO PA “Women for Peace and Security” Award; 2023 Anna Lindh Prize laureate. She and other Belarusian opposition leaders won the 2022 Charlemagne Prize.In 2021, she was nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and multiple Norwegian members of parliament.

1,"Olga Mikhailovna Abramova (Belarusian: Вольга Міхайлаўна Абрамава; Russian: О́льга Миха́йловна Абра́мова; born 19 September 1953) is a Belarusian political scientist and politician. A Candidate of Sciences in philosophy, Abramova was member of the House of Representatives from 2000 until 2008, and member of the Supreme Council of the Republic from 1996 to 2001. Although a pro-Russian politician, Ambramova is also a supporter of good relations between Belarus and the West. In her opinion, Alexander Lukashenko's policy enjoys the support of the majority of society. Abramova is critical of some of the leaders of the Belarusian opposition.


== Early life ==
Abramova was born on 19 September 1953 in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union. In 1975, she graduated from the Belarusian State University, receiving education as a sociologist and philosopher. In 1988, she obtained the degree of Candidate of Philosophical Sciences (equivalent to a PhD). The topic of her candidacy thesis was: The humanism of using coercive measures in the socialist revolution. She lectured at the Belarusian State Technological University and the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, and was gradually promoted from assistant to associate professor. In 1995 and from 1997, she was the director of research programs of the National Center for Strategic Initiatives ""East-West"". She worked as the director of scientific and educational programs of the ""Strategia"" analytical center. Abramova speaks German.


== Career ==


=== Start of socio-political activity ===
At the end of the 1980s, Abramova became active in socio-political life. She opposed the transition of the education system to the Belarusian language and strongly opposed the law on languages adopted on 26 January 1990 at the 14th session of the Supreme Soviet, which provided for the establishment of Belarusian as the only state language. She advocated that the Byelorussian SSR should have two state languages: Belarusian and Russian. In 1991–1994 she was co-chair of the Movement for Democratic Reforms of Belarus. She also served as co-chair of the international Democratic Reform Movement.


=== Member of the Supreme Council (1996–2001) ===
In the second round of supplementary parliamentary elections on 10 December 1995, Abramova was elected member of the Supreme Council of Belarus of the 13th term from the Academic Electoral District No. 242 of the city of Minsk. On 19 December 1995, she was registered by the Central Electoral Commission, and on 9 January 1996, she was sworn in as a deputy. From 23 January, she served in the Supreme Council as a member, and then as secretary of the Standing Committee for International Affairs. Abramova was non-partisan; she belonged to the social democratic faction ""Labour Union"". From June 3, she was a member of the working group of the Supreme Council for cooperation with the Bundestag of Germany. On 21 June, she became a member of the council's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Community of Belarus and Russia. In November 1996, during the political crisis related to the referendum initiated by President Alexander Lukashenko, Abramova spoke out against the president, and supported the motion to impeach him. On 27 November 1996, after the president's controversial and partly internationally unrecognized change to the constitution, she was not a member of the House of Representatives of the first term. However, she also sharply criticized the opposition. According to the Constitution of Belarus of 1994, her mandate as a deputy to the Supreme Council ended on 9 January 2001; however, subsequent elections to this body were never held.In 1997, she founded and headed the Belarusian Public Union ""Yabloko"", which brought together Russian-speaking democrats, was centrist, social-liberal in nature and was established with the support of the Russian Yabloko party. The organization coordinated its activities with the Coordination Council of Democratic Forces (RKSD), a body uniting the Belarusian opposition, within the Consultative Council of Opposition Political Parties, through the OSCE Consultation and Observation Mission. In the second half of 1999 and the first half of 2000, the organization led by Abramova participated in talks with the authorities on the democratization of the electoral code before the 2000 parliamentary elections. Representatives of Yabloko participated in the talks until the very end, until July 2000, even after the main opposition parties withdrew from them. Belarusian state media referred to the organization as a ""constructive opposition"".


=== Member of the House of Representatives (2000–2008) ===
Ambramova and her organization did not join the boycott of the parliamentary elections announced on 2 July by the 4th Congress of the RKSD. She put forward her candidacy and on 21 November 2000 and she became a member of the House of Representatives of the 2nd term from the Eastern Electoral District No. 106 of the city of Minsk. She thus became one of two people, next to Vladimir Novosiad, who were elected to the Chamber and who had previously belonged to the opposition in the Supreme Council of the 13th term. Due to her participation in the elections, supporters of the boycott considered her a ""pseudo-democrat"". Shortly after being elected to the Chamber, Abramova joined the pro-presidential camp. She served as a member of the Committee on Legislation and Judicial and Legal Issues. She belonged to the parliamentary group ""Supporting Economic Development"". She was one of two deputies, alongside Iwan Paszkiewicz, who reacted to the letter sent on 3 March 2001 by the leaders of the four main Protestant Churches in Belarus. In the letter, they criticized the new version of the law on freedom of religion, according to which the registration of religious associations was made more difficult, and also expressed concern about the particularly privileged position of the Russian Orthodox Church. The remaining deputies, like members of the Council of the Republic and Alexander Lukashenko, ignored the letter.Abramova took part in the parliamentary elections in 2004. According toJuryja Czawusaua, during the election campaign, she exceeded the funds allocated for agitation by disseminating reports on her parliamentary activities for deputies of the House of Representatives of the second term. There were no cases of the authorities confiscating her election materials, which was the case with the materials of opposition candidates. On 16 November 2004, she became a member of the House of Representatives of the 3rd term from the Kalinowski Electoral District No. 108 of the city of Minsk. She served as a member of the Standing Committee on State Construction, Local Government and Regulations. According to Alaksander Piatkiewicz and Wolf Rubinczyk, in the House of Representatives she showed ""moderate opposition"", i.e. she spoke out against individual repressive actions of the executive power. On 29 June 2005, she was the only member of parliament who voted against the law on social organizations, which, among others, facilitated their liquidation, made registration and operation more difficult, and prohibited the activities of unregistered organizations. Her term in the House of Representatives ended on 27 October 2008.On 30 May 2007, Abramova announced the liquidation of the Belarusian Public Union ""Yabloko"". The reason was two warnings from the Ministry of Justice due to the lack of a legal address for the union. Abramova had stopped renting an office for the union several years earlier due to lack of funds.


== Views ==
According to Abramova, Belarusian national identity consists primarily in the bond with the native land and love for native landscapes. She does not consider the community of Slavs to be an important factor, because in her opinion it is only a community of blood, while the Slavic nations have different cultures and are heading in different directions. However, there is a community of nations of the former Soviet Union, from which Abramova excludes Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, but includes Israelis coming from the territory of the former USSR.Abramova describes herself as a pro-Russian but also pro-European politician. It declares support for maintaining a pragmatic balance between Eastern and Western policies in order to achieve benefits for the country. In her opinion, it is convenient and expedient for Belarus to remain in a military-political alliance with Russia, as well as other organizations in which it is involved, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. However, she stipulates that Belarus should not be part of Russia, as it is advisable for it to also develop good relations with the West. She describes Russia's policy towards Belarus as pragmatic, consistent with its national and state interests and the will of the majority of Russian society. However, she assesses the policy of Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine in this area very negatively. In her opinion, it does not meet the interests of these countries, and the local political elites are conducting it against the will of the majority of their citizens.Europe, in Abramova's opinion, is a community of cultural and civilizational values to which Belarus belongs from the point of view of geography and history, but not in terms of dominant social thought. Belarus should strive to achieve European standards in the field of quality and comfort of life, as well as social security, but should not adopt some civic values. Abramova criticizes what she considers to be too much trust of Europeans in the information provided in the media, their materialistic lifestyle and excessive bureaucracy. According to her, Europeans do not understand the specificity of Belarus and its peculiar national character. She considers European integration to be a generally beneficial process, because European integration is better than economic autarky. Belarus could contribute to it primarily in the fields of culture and science. The ideal variant would be the integration of Russia with European structures. However, in the foreseeable future, Belarus should not make a civilizational choice and wait for the final development of the international order. Abramova explains the negative attitude of the European Union towards Belarusian authorities as a lack of understanding of the processes taking place in the country. In her opinion, the EU's policy is shaped by a part of the Belarusian opposition, which in fact does not want any changes. Abramova also criticizes the EU for the lack of specific material incentives for integration with it.According to Abramova, Belarusian state media idealize the situation in the country, while non-state media exaggerate criticism. In order to avoid a false, one-sided image of Belarus, both sources should be treated with caution. She claims that both political and economic changes are taking place in the country, but we should be more patient while waiting for them. In her opinion, Lukashenko's policies, both domestic and foreign, have the support of the majority of Belarusian society. She is very critical of some of the Belarusian opposition leaders who have turned politics into business. In her opinion, despite loud declarations, they do not want Belarus to be democratized and open to the world, because their current status is comfortable for them. According to Abramova, they shape the European Union's policy towards Belarus.Abramova describes herself as choleric and extrovert.


== Commentary ==
Abramova was described as a ""pseudo-democrat"" by supporters of the boycott of the 2000 parliamentary elections. This happened so that, when the majority of the opposition supported the boycott and Abramova did not join it, she would put forward her candidacy and win the seat as a deputy. Brian Bennett described her in this context as Lukashenko's favorite oppositionist. Zianon Pazniak has been critical of her, calling her a polytrusifier from Lukashenko's ""patka"". According to political scientist Iryna Yekadumava, the ""Yabloko"" organization she led—after right-wing parties refused to contact the authorities that they considered illegal—had a chance in 2001 to capture the electorate of centrist forces, represented by the middle class, intelligentsia, part of the nomenklatura and employees of the state apparatus.

== Press secretary of Alexander Lukashenko ==
In 2014, Natallia Eismant was appointed press secretary of the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. Circumstances of her promotion are unknown. One source claimed that she was introduced to Lukashenko by the beauty queen Daria Shmanai, who accompanied the president. Fashion designer Sasha Varlamov claimed that the sister-in-law Hanna Eismant introduced Natallia to Lukashenko. In 2018, her husband Ivan Eismant was appointed the head of the National State Television and Radio Company.In office she made several controversial statements. In 2019, she advocated dictatorship, claiming it to be ""Belarusian brand"". She said that dictatorship is ""order, discipline and absolutely normal calm life"". In 2020, she claimed that the lack of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic was a thoughtful measure of Lukashenko. On 23 September 2020, Eismant misinformed journalists about the inauguration of Lukashenko: she told that the journalists will be ""surely informed"" about the inauguration, but they learned about the event from the state TV news after the inauguration was held. In November 2021, she voiced a completely different version about content of a phone conversation between Alexander Lukashenko and Angela Merkel which was later disproved by the German authorities.She is considered to be one of the most influential women among the Belarusian authorities. Eismant is reported to have a big impact on Lukashenko. She is reported to maintain the Telegram channel of the president's press service or write to it personally.


== International sanctions ==
On 6 November 2020, the Council of the European Union included Natallia Eismant in the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 765/2006. Her public statements defending Lukashenko and criticizing opposition activists and peaceful protesters were considered as ""seriously undermining democracy and the rule of law in Belarus"". She was banned from visiting European Union and her assets in EU were frozen. Eismant was also sanctioned by the United Kingdom, and Canada.

In 2014, Kochanova was appointed Deputy Prime Minister by President Alexander Lukashenko.


== Chief of Staff and Council of the Republic ==
On 21 December 2016, Kochanova was appointed Chief of Staff to the President of Belarus and Head of the Presidential Administration of Belarus by Lukashenko, who is known as Europe's ""last dictator"". At the time Lukashenko called her an ""ardent supporter of the state policy."" She is one of his key supporters and advisors. Political scientist Dmitry Bolkunets has suggested that Kochanova could be seen by Lukashenko as a possible successor. However, Lukashenko himself has previously said that a woman cannot be the President.In December 2019, Lukashenko sent Kochanova to the Council of the Republic under the presidential quota, replacing her as head of the Presidential Administration with former Deputy Chair of the KGB Igor Sergeenko. Kochanova was elected speaker of the Council on 6 December 2019, receiving 59 of the 60 votes. She is the first woman to hold the position.In January 2020, Kochanova met with United Kingdom ambassador Jacqueline Perkins seeking to deepen ties between the two countries. In April 2020, Kochanova was asked by Lukashenko to invite the World Health Organization to assess the performance of Belarus's healthcare system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She said there was no need for emergency measures and the economy should keep working as usual.


== 2020 presidential election and aftermath ==

Kochanova was Chief of Staff for Lukashenko's election campaign in August 2020, who covers the bloody regime and repressions of Lukashenko's forces. After over 7,000 people were arrested during August 2020 protests calling for Lukashenko's resignation after the disputed election, Kochanova spoke on Lukashenko's behalf about the release of 1,000 of those arrested, saying they were now ""under the obligation not to participate in unauthorized activities."" She said, ""We don't need unrest. We don't need war."" On 15 August, thousands of protestors outside the state television building demanded full coverage of the protests. After television staff joined them, Kochanova arrived, but was unable to pacify the crowd. The following day, state television reported on the protests for the first time.Opening the fourth session of the National Assembly on 2 October 2020, Kochanova said, ""The election campaign was held in difficult conditions. We witnessed unconcealed external pressure on our country and the aggravation of an unhealthy public situation by internal destructive forces. People made their choice in support of the incumbent President, in favor of stability, peace, tranquility, and the policy pursued in the country."" She also said, ""Lies and misleading information about the country is being spread ... We, the members of the Council of the Republic, strongly condemn the gross interference of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine and other foreign countries in the internal affairs of Belarus."" Later in October, the Council of Europe issued a statement condemning any further use of violence in Belarus, including ""disproportionate use of force by the authorities against protestors."" Kochanova issued a statement in response, saying the West receives ""one-sided information"" on the situation in Belarus from people who “do not represent the majority of citizens who supported the country’s course during the presidential election."" She said Belarus was ""ready to discuss the situation in the country with foreign partners, subject to mutual respect, objectivity, consideration of the parties’ interests and non-interference with internal affairs.""After the German Bundestag adopted a resolution on 4 November 2020 rejecting the results of the presidential election as neither free nor fair, denying the legitimacy of Lukashenko and calling for a new vote, Kochanova and Chair of the House of Representatives, Vladimir Andreichenko, issued a joint statement. They called the resolution ""blatant interference"" in Belarus' affairs, saying they were ""utterly bewildered"" by German support for open calls for ""terrorist activities"". The statement said, ""By the Resolution the Bundestag undermines the progress achieved in relations between Belarus and Germany, and panders to the mercenary interests of individual politicians who are trying to earn political capital on the image of “fighters for democracy in Belarus” while ignoring the harsh repressive actions of law enforcement agencies in their own country.""In November 2020, Kochanova held an unsuccessful meeting with student protesters at Belarusian State University. She denied vote rigging and torture of those detained, but the students protested her comments. She said, ""I thought that we will come out of here and ... be friends. But I am very saddened by the fact that today the framework of human norms and morality is being shattered ... when an adult woman like me is standing in front of you, and you shout in her face, this is rude and unacceptable."" While answering the students' questions, Kochanova used ""Dulles' Plan"" conspiracy theory to explain the situation in Belarus.On 18 November 2020, Kochanova had a meeting with local deputies and officials of Polotsk and Novopolotsk. According to the leaked audio recording, she claimed that the protests had been organized from abroad, declared the photos of the people beaten by the police to be fake, supported expulsion of students from the universities for political reasons.On 27 November 2020, the Council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly awarded Kochanova with its medal ""For Strengthening Parliamentary Cooperation.""Due to her role, Kochanova was sanctioned by the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland; she is also subject to the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctions. In 2022, she was also blacklisted by Japan, Ukraine and Canada.In 2021, ethnologist Uladzimir Lobač fired from the Polack State University claimed that his forced leave was the result of pressure of Natalya Kochanova and Ihar Marzaliuk on the university.

== Early life ==
Tsepkalo's mother is Evgenia Shesterikova, sister is Natalya Leonyuk. Her grandfather Peter Shesterikov, was a writer, who has a street name in Mogilev named in his memory.In 1998, Tsepkalo graduated from the Faculty of International Relations of the Belarus State University with a degree in International Relations.

== 2020 election activism ==
When Tsepkalo's husband Valery Tsepkalo (a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States) announced his participation in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, Tsepkalo accompanied him on his trips. On 14 July 2020, Valery was denied registration as a presidential candidate in Belarus. Soon after that, the three chief opposition candidates—Valery Tsepkalo, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, and Viktar Babaryka–united their campaigns. Since the unification of these campaigns, Veronica became her husband's representative at the campaign rallies of Tikhanovskaya, while Valery and his children left the country fearing for their safety. In addition, throughout the campaign, Veronica was constantly under pressure from the government: from collecting information in the school where children study. Her sister Natalia Leonyuk was summoned to testify against Valery Tsepkalo.On 30 July 2020, during a rally in Minsk, Veronica spoke about the personal affairs of her family, and cited the falsification of a criminal case against her mother, who at that time was already in a serious medical condition. Fearing the loss of her freedom as a result of political persecution, she fled the country on the eve of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, joining her husband in Moscow. She cast her vote at the Belarusian embassy in Moscow.Following the rigged August 2020 presidential election, in which incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko declared victory, Tsepkalo said that the ""only legitimate President is Svetlana Tikhanovskaya"" and called upon other countries to recognize Tikhanovsakaya as the legitimately elected president of Belarus.On 19 August 2020, it was reported that Tsepkalo was in Poland with her husband and children. Tsepkalo and her family remain in exile in Poland.

12,"Sviatlana Hieorhiyeuna Tsikhanouskaya (née Pilipchuk; born 11 September 1982) is a Belarusian political activist. After standing as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election against the president Alexander Lukashenko, she has led the political opposition to his authoritarian rule through an oppositional government operating from Lithuania and Poland.
Tsikhanouskaya became an opposition leader after her husband, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, ran as a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential election. He was arrested, along with most other opposition leaders, and, as she was unable to file for the presidency on his behalf, Tsikhanouskaya entered herself into the race as a candidate. Lukashenko allowed her candidacy because he believed that a woman could not form legitimate opposition. She ran on a platform of constitutional reform, seeking free and fair elections with term limits on the presidency, and she pledged to step down once this was implemented. After Lukashenko was declared the victor, she was held by Belarusian authorities and then forced into exile in Lithuania. Election observers consider the election fraudulent, and Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate head of state of Belarus. 
Since fleeing to Lithuania, Tsikhanouskaya has established an oppositional government. She established the Coordination Council in 2020 and the United Transitional Cabinet in 2022. As a representative of a democratic Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya has met with several world leaders in a diplomatic capacity to negotiate sanctions against Lukashenko's government and to deny him recognition as a legitimate head of state. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she has been an advocate of increased Western support for Ukraine, while also warning that Russia's actions should not overshadow opposition to the dictatorship in Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya was tried in absentia by the Belarusian government in 2023 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.


== Early life ==
Sviatlana Pilipchuk was born on 11 September 1982 in the village of Mikashevichy to Hieorhij Ivanavič and Valancina Mikałajeuna Pilipčuk. Her father was a driver at a concrete factory, and her mother was a cafeteria cook. She grew up in a Soviet prefabricated apartment building, where she spent much of her time reading. Among her books were some from the United States, which she read to learn English and learn about the world outside of Belarus.Pilipchuk's village was near the Chernobyl exclusion zone. When she was twelve years old, she was taken to Roscrea, Ireland, by the Chernobyl Lifeline charity, which helped children travel so as to reduce their exposure to radiation. Though Pilipchuk was not as affected by radiation as other students, her proficiency in school earned her a spot. While staying in Ireland, she would translate for the other children. Pilipchuk lived with a host family, the Deanes, who effectively became second parents to her. She returned over the following three summers, and she felt that Ireland was a more cheerful place than Belarus. Even after she stopped visiting Ireland, she has stayed in contact with the Deanes in adulthood.Pilipchuk attended Mozyr State Pedagogical University to study teaching. While she was in Mazyr, she met nightclub owner Syarhei Tsikhanouski in 2003. They married in 2004, and she took the name Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Together they had two children: a son and a daughter, about five years apart. Her son was born mostly deaf, and much of her time went to assisting him. She moved from Minsk to Gomel where he could receive treatment, including a cochlear implant. Until 2020, Tsikhanouskaya was an English teacher and interpreter. She retired so she had more time to raise her children. She pulled her children out of school when the COVID-19 pandemic developed, as the government had not taken any prevention measures.


== 2020 Belarusian presidential election ==


=== Background and building a campaign ===
In 2019, Tsikhanouskaya's husband Tsikhanouski started a YouTube channel, ""A Country for Life"", in which he interviewed people and challenged the rule of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. He became a prominent opposition leader through his YouTube and Telegram presence, as well as his organization of political protests. He moved to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, and he was subsequently arrested for his protest activity days before the filing deadline.: 122–123  Tsikhanouskaya attempted to file for her husband by proxy but was rejected. In response, she filed for her own candidacy.: 123  She later said that she did this solely as a show of support for her husband. Tsikhanouskaya registered as an Independent candidate on 14 July 2020.Tsikhanouskaya initially had no interest in building a campaign. When her husband was released, he continued the campaign even though it was her name on the paperwork. He sometimes brought a life-size cutout of Tsikhanouskaya when he campaigned. She easily acquired the 100,000 signatures that were needed to run—a high limit that was expected to block opposition candidates from running. Her candidacy was confirmed on 19 July 2020. From this day, she traveled across Belarus to hold campaign events.Tsikhanouski was arrested a second time, accused of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was later found to be staged. With her husband imprisoned, Tsikhanouskaya became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko in the presidential election,: 123  making her a rare example of an opposition leader in an autocratic nation that arose through a political campaign.: 120  She aligned with Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of opposition candidate Valery Tsepkalo who had fled the country, and Maria Kalesnikava, the campaign manager of opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested.: 123 2020 was a time of political vulnerability for Lukashenko. He had grown more unpopular because of his mishandling of economic issues and his dismissive response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus.: 122  Most opposition candidates were removed from the race, either through arrest or disqualification.: 123  Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy, believing that as a woman she was not a significant political threat. He instead belittled her for being a female political candidate, using sexist language.: 119  Tsikhanouskaya leaned into the feminine aspects of her candidacy, emphasizing that she was a mother, and her gender may have indicated to voters that she was less likely to seek power for herself.: 124 Instead of running as a protest candidate, encouraging a boycott as her husband had intended, she built a campaign. Tsikhanouskaya described herself as an ""accidental candidate"", and she said that she would only hold office until the Lukashenko dictatorship was seen to an end.: 120  Her role in the campaign was to serve as a face for the opposition movement rather than to engage in politics. Her role has been compared to Joan of Arc by the Belarusian press. She said of the campaign that ""every day was full of fear"".


=== Campaigning ===
Though she was running as an independent candidate, Tsikhanouskaya attracted support from across the spectrum of Belarus's political opposition. Vital Rymasheuski, co-leader of Belarusian Christian Democracy, announced his party's support, as did the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Assembly), United Civic Party of Belarus, and Belarusian Women's Party ""Nadzieja"". She also received support from 2010 presidential candidate Mikola Statkevich, and president of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Ivonka Survilla. Tsikhanouskaya's shared experience with the other wives of arrested dissidents earned her many supporters among women.: 124  Rallies in support of Tsikhanouskaya and in opposition to Lukashenko were the largest in the history of post-Soviet Belarus, attracting crowds of 20,000 in Brest and 220,000 in Minsk. Tsikhanouskaya had no political experience, and she had to be taught how to speak to the media. This endeared her to voters and protesters, who saw her as an ordinary citizen like themselves. Her open dislike of politics fueled this response.During the presidential campaign, Tsikhanouskaya was repeatedly threatened, recounting threatening phone calls from unknown numbers, which said, ""We will put you behind bars and place your children in an orphanage"". Tsikhanouskaya said she then decided to persevere in her campaign, saying that ""there must be a symbol of freedom"". Her campaign began as Amnesty International condemned Belarus's discriminatory treatment of women opposition activists, including threats of sexual violence and threats by authorities to take children away from opposition figures and send them to state-run orphanages. Worried for the safety of her children, Tsikhanouskaya had them hidden abroad in Lithuania.Tsikhanouskaya said that she ran for president out of love, to free her husband from prison. She ran on only three political issues: the release of political prisoners, constitutional limitations on the presidency, and new elections. Once these three things happened, she said, she would step down from the presidency. To reform the constitution, she pledged to set a referendum on returning to the original draft of the 1994 Belarusian constitution, reinstating a limit of two terms for the president. She also vowed to move away from the union treaty with Russia. She said that her main goal was to establish free and fair elections. She viewed the election as illegitimate due to the government's refusal to register Lukashenko's main political opponents as candidates. She pledged to deliver a plan for transparent and accountable elections within six months of taking office.Tsikhanouskaya's economic platform emphasized increasing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses in the Belarusian economy. She planned to offer interest free loans to small and medium-sized businesses, cancel state inspections of private entities, and provide legal protection for foreign investors. She planned to allow profitable state owned enterprises to continue to operate, while requiring unprofitable state owned enterprises to take advice from outside professionals.


=== Election day and departure from Belarus ===
The night before the election, police detained senior staffers from Tsikhanouskaya's campaign and she chose to go into hiding in Minsk, before re-emerging on election day at a polling station. When the results were announced, Tsikhanouskaya officially received only ten percent of the vote. Poll workers were required to engage in electoral fraud to ensure Lukashenko's victory over Tsikhanouskaya,: 125  and protests took place across Belarus in response. According to election monitor Golos and independent observers, Tsikhanouskaya was the legitimate winner of the election. After Belarusian state television released an exit poll showed Lukashenko winning by an overwhelming margin, Tsikhanouskaya said that she didn't trust that poll, saying, ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us"".Tsikhanouskaya and her lawyer went to the Central Election Commission the following day, where they were confronted by armed guards, and Tsikhanouskaya was forced to meet with Lukashenko's enforcer Andrei Pavlyuchenko. She was given an ultimatum to either leave the country, or to go to prison and have her children taken. They described to her in detail what life in prison would be like for her, where political prisoners were frequently tortured, and what life for her children would be like as wards of the state. She attempted to negotiate the release of her husband in exchange for ending her challenge and leaving the country. Her offer was refused, but instead she was able to negotiate the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz. Tsikhanouskaya and Moroz prepared to leave for Lithuania; Tsikhanouskaya collected her passport and her son's cochlear implant equipment, while Moroz arranged to have her own children escorted to Lithuania by her sister. The women also demanded that a Belarusian KGB agent escort them to the border in Moroz's car, to prevent the use of a car bomb.A video was released of Tsikhanouskaya conceding to Lukashenko and asking the protesters to stand down. The stark change in demeanor and message led allies to say that the video had been coerced, with some going as far as to liken it to a hostage video.


== Exile ==


=== Establishing an opposition government-in-exile ===
On 11 August 2020, Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius announced that Tsikhanouskaya was safe in Lithuania while also acknowledging that she had ""few options"". She felt that she had ""betrayed"" her supporters by leaving the country. The same day, the State Security Committee of Belarus alleged that an attempt was being made on Tsikhanouskaya's life, saying that the protesters needed a ""sacred sacrifice"".Days after she left the country, Tsikhanouskaya declared herself the ""leader of democratic Belarus"". To this effect, she announced the establishment of a Coordination Council to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko. Applications for membership in the council were open only to Belarusian authority figures, such as respected professionals, authors, or sportspeople. Tsikhanouskaya considered herself to be an ""interim-leader"" of Belarus, but she has not claimed an entitlement to the presidency. She has indicated that she will not seek the presidency again, instead continuing her diplomatic work until fair elections can be held.Tsikhanouskaya appealed to the international community to recognise her as the winner, traveling to various European capitals and meeting with world leaders, including President Joe Biden, Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron, President Ursula von der Leyen, President Charles Michel, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Western nations and the European Parliament have generally opted not to recognise Lukashenko's reelection. She has also sought sanctions against Belarus, speaking with world leaders in an effort to get them applied. After a period of protest, Lukashenko regained de facto control over the nation. Tsikhanouskaya has denied that she leads a government in exile, saying that she wished to create a ""permanent opposition inside Belarus"". The nation of Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate leader of Belarus.On 9 August 2022, at a conference held in Vilnius, Tsikhanouskaya announced the creation of the United Transitional Cabinet. It initially consisted of Pavel Latushko (responsible for the transition of power), Aliaksandr Azarau (responsible for the restoration of law and order), Valery Kavaleuski (foreign affairs), and Valery Sakhashchyk (defense and national security). Belarus declared Tsikhanouskaya's organizations to be extremist formations in January 2023, making her subject to prison time should she be captured by the Belarusian government. Two months later, she was tried in absentia and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.European Parliament and a number of governments recognize Tsikhanouskaya and her structures as legitimate representative of the Republic of Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya is often referred by foreign government representatives, diplomats and parliamentarians as ""President"", ""President-elect"", ""Leader of Democratic Belarus"", while her Cabinet is referred as ""government in exile.""The Council of Europe, the European Union and the United States of America have established the formal cooperation with the structures of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.


=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

When the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, Tsikhanouskaya sought to promote the anti-war movement in Belarus.: 125  She has objected to the international framing of Belarus as merely a vassal state of Russia, alleging that it downplays the severity of Lukashenko's rule. Regarding Lukashenko's support of the invasion, Tsikhanouskaya accused him of treason.Following Belarus's entry into the war, Tsikhanouskaya and her supporters developed the Pieramoha Plan (Victory Plan), a strategy involving underground dissidents in Belarus, engaging in information sharing and sabotage. She has said that the dissidents must wait until ""the right moment"", when instability allows for a change in power.Tsikhanouskaya argues that the existence of a dictatorship in Belarus threatens the safety not only of Ukraine, but of the other states bordering Belarus: Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as Belarus has been used by Russia to attack neighboring countries like Ukraine. She supports continued political and economic involvement by the West in support of Ukraine's efforts in the Russo-Ukrainian War. She has warned of war fatigue stymieing Western support for Ukraine and Belarusian dissidents.


== Awards ==
Tsikhanouskaya was on the 2020 list of the BBC's 100 Women, announced on 23 November 2020, and was included in the 2020 edition of The Bloomberg 50. Tsikhanouskaya and other Belarusian opposition leaders were awarded the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in a ceremony on 16 December in Brussels. Among dozens of distinctions, she is a recipient of the 2020 Globsec prize for freedom; 2022 International Four Freedoms Award; 2022 International Trailblazer Award; 2022 Tipperary International Peace Award, 2023 IDU Bush-Thatcher Award for Freedom; 2023 NATO PA “Women for Peace and Security” Award; 2023 Anna Lindh Prize laureate.

She was a member of the Central Election Commission of Belarus (1992–1996), and Chairwoman (1996–2021).


== Biography ==
Yermoshina was born in Slutsk, Minsk Region on 29 January 1953. In 1975, she graduated from the Faculty of Law at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University. Beginning in 1975, she worked as a legal advisor until becoming an attorney's assistant in 1987. She became Chairwoman of the Judiciary of the City Executive Committee of Babruysk in 1988, a post she held until 1996.


=== Belarusian elections ===
She has been a member of the Central Election Commission of Belarus since 1992, and Chairwoman of the organization since 1996. She was appointed by decree by Alexander Lukashenko in contradiction with the Constitution of Belarus, which stated that the candidacy of the Chairman of the CEC must be approved by the Supreme Council of Belarus. The previous Chairman, Viktar Hanchar, had been an active critic of the 1996 Belarusian referendum and was removed by Lukashenko after serving just little over a month.
In 2004, following the 2004 Belarusian parliamentary election and constitutional referendum, Yermoshina was banned from entering the European Union for allegedly participating in the manipulation of the results of the presidential election. Following the same accusations, in 2006, the United States included her in the sanction list as well. The ban was lifted in 2008.On 15 December 2010, presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov logged a legal complaint application to the Central Election Commission of Belarus, demanding they remove Yermoshyna from her office as Chairperson of the Central Election Commission. He cited that her position was illegal, as Yermoshyna was a member of incumbent Aleksandr Lukashenko's political team, compromising her neutrality, and was under international scrutiny for purportedly rigging the previous election. The complaints were ineffective. Yermoshina was again sanctioned by the European Union in the aftermath of the 2010 election; these sanctions were suspended in 2015 and lifted in 2016.On 9 August 2020, Yermoshina appeared on Belarusian TV to condemn the ""deliberate provocations"" of protest voters in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. She also described long queues outside polling stations as an attempt at ""sabotage"" by the opposition.Independent observers of the election have noted vote counting irregularities and dozens have been subject to harassment and detention. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the elections as ""neither free nor fair."" After the election and the subsequent protests, Yermoshina was banned from entering the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada.Yermoshina was replaced by the former Minister of Education Ihar Karpenka on 13 December 2021.

== Early life and education ==
Sasha Bezuhanova was born in Pernik, Bulgaria. She graduated German language high school in Sofia. Bezuhanova went on to study in Technical University in Sofia graduating with Masters in Electronics (1985). She also has an Executive master's degree in International Negotiations and Policy Making from the Graduate Institute in Geneva (2015) and has Executive qualifications from INSEAD and Stanford.
She attended special programs for studying the Irish economic model (Dublin, 2001), the structure of ICT sector in California (Palo Alto, 2002) and European Software Institute (Bilbao, 2003).
Aside from her native language Sasha Bezuhanova speaks English, German and Russian.


== Career ==
The professional career of Sasha Bezuhanova started in 1985 in the Central Institute for Computer Technologies where in 1986 she became Research Associate.
Shortly after the democratic changes in Bulgaria when the country opened up direct presence of international businesses she was invited by Germany's medical concern HELLIGE to head their Bulgarian operation. Under her leadership (1990 to 1994) the company played a key role in the modernization of the Bulgarian health infrastructure.
Her international business and operational management experience evolved further as General Manager for S&T Bulgaria, the exclusive distributor of HP – a role she took over in 1995.
When HP decided to open up direct operation in Bulgaria in 1997 Bezuhanova was appointed as General Manager. Sasha Bezuhanova has managed Hewlett-Packard's business in Bulgaria for more than 10 years. In that period of time HP's Bulgarian team developed a series of IT infrastructure projects for the country's three biggest telecommunication companies, industrial manufacturers, and state and private finance institutions. Some of these projects have been implemented for the first time in Bulgaria and became reference solutions incorporated in the HP's portfolio. Among them was the implementation of electronic ID for Bulgarian citizens, which ended in August 1999 and was the key to Bulgaria's acceptance in the EU visa-free countries list in 2001. Another flagship project, that enriched the HP's worldwide practice, was the implementation of the Real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) in Macedonia.Her most important accomplishment at the time was attracting an important investment of HP in Bulgaria where in 2006 started operation HP Global Delivery Centre. Today it employs more than 5000 high-profile engineers and specialists. That strategic project placed the country on the world IT investment map. As a result, Hewlett-Packard has become the largest IT employer in Bulgaria and the Top 5 in the country overall. Hewlett-Packard became also the largest investor and employer in the Bulgarian IT sector.Sasha Bezuhanova continued her career in HP on international level being appointed in 2008 as Public Sector Director for Central Eastern Europe. She manages the corporation’s government business in 27 countries including Russia, New Europe, Western Balkans, and Central Asia bringing in an important strategic dimension and a holistic approach to this market segment.
In 2012 Bezuhanova was appointed as Director of Public Sector and Education for HP Growth Markets – a region including 67 countries around the world. As part of her business development responsibilities, she coordinated the company's relations with the EU, WB, and UN.
In 2013 when it became very critical in Bulgaria and the country was shaken by protests against the oligarchic establishment figures, Sasha Bezuhanova decided to leave her career and devote herself to the cause of positive change in Bulgaria. She founded the non-partisan organization MOVE.BG – a platform for collaboration in finding sustainable solutions for the state, economy, and society via innovation, participation, and co-creation. MOVE.BG is affirming the culture of constructive dialog, participating leadership, democratic principles, and the European path of Bulgaria. Some of the programs are ‘Electoral reform’, ‘Media pluralism’, ‘Law and order in 5 steps’, ""You move Europe’, ‘Solutions for Bulgaria: Digital’, ‘Solution for Bulgaria: Economics’ and the online platform ‘My Bulgarian History‘. In 2016, upon the initiative of Sasha Bezuhanova MOVE.BG together with key organizations, hubs, and companies developing digital knowledge and innovative business in Bulgaria, founded EDIT.BG (Economic Development via Innovation and Technologies) – an open network for digital development and innovation in Bulgaria. In 2018, Sasha inspired the foundation of the platform for collaboration and Changemakers, bringing together trendsetters with different professional backgrounds for exchange and joint action. In 2020, Bezuhanova initiated the establishment of the Green Restart Coalition bringing unprecedentedly together digital innovation and sustainability experts, scientists, and green activists for defining and driving a holistic green transformation agenda for Bulgaria. Some of the projects of the Coalition realized under the management of MOVE.BG are publishing the first ""Textbook on the Future History of Bulgaria"", the creation of the first metaverse-based ministry - the Ministry of Climate Transition and Green Transformation, publishing ""Mission Green Bulgaria"" - a report with more than 150 recommendations for supporting the sustainable development, and ""Mission Energy Transition"" - a report with over 150 recommendations in support of Bulgaria's energy transformation, publishing five opinion papers for improving the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan under the Next Generation EU.

16,"Kristalina Ivanova Georgieva-Kinova (Bulgarian: Кристалина Иванова Георгиева-Кинова; née Georgieva; born 13 August 1953) is a Bulgarian economist serving as the 12th managing director of the International Monetary Fund since 2019. She was the Chief Executive of the World Bank Group from 2017 to 2019 and served as Acting President of the World Bank Group from 1 February to 8 April 2019 following the resignation of Jim Yong Kim. She previously served as Vice-President of the European Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker from 2014 to 2016.


== Early life and education ==
Georgieva was born in Sofia into a family of bureaucrats. Her father was a civil engineer who supervised state road-building projects, and her grandfather was a prominent Bulgarian revolutionary, Ivan Karshovski.Georgieva holds a PhD in Economics and an MA in Political Economy and Sociology from the Karl Marx Higher Institute of Economics (now called University of National and World Economy) in Sofia. Her thesis was on ""Environmental Protection Policy and Economic Growth in the USA"". She also did postgraduate research and studies in natural resource economics and environmental policy at the London School of Economics in the late 1980s and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has written over 100 academic papers and has also authored a microeconomics textbook.Georgieva is fluent in Bulgarian, English, and Russian, and also speaks some French.
She held a range of academic and consulting positions in Bulgaria and the US, and has made presentations at the Australian National University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, Yale University, Harvard University, London School of Economics, and the University of the South Pacific.


== Early work (1993–2010) ==
Georgieva started her career at the World Bank Group in 1993 as an environmental economist for Europe and Central Asia. Following this, she served in various positions in the bank ultimately rising to become director of the Environment Department in charge of World Bank's environmental strategy, policies, and lending. In this role she oversaw around 60% of lending operations of the World Bank Group. From 2004 to 2007 she was the institution's director and resident representative in the Russian Federation, based in Moscow.
She returned to Washington, D.C., to become director of Strategy and Operations, Sustainable Development. Her final position at the World Bank, vice president and corporate secretary, conveyed lead responsibility for liaison with the members of the institution's board of executive directors, representing the bank's shareholders (the member country governments). During that time, she worked on the bank's governance reform and accompanying capital increase. In January 2010, Georgieva announced her intention to resign from this post in view of her nomination to the Commission of the European Union.


== Political career ==


=== European Commissioner ===
Nomination and confirmationAfter the former Bulgarian nominee for the post of European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Rumiana Jeleva, came under fire during her confirmation hearing from members of the European Parliament over both her competence and allegations of gaps in her declaration of financial interests, she withdrew her bid. The Bulgarian government then proposed Kristalina Georgieva as their new candidate. On 21 January 2010 the European Commission President José Manuel Barroso met with Georgieva and expressed his approval, stating that ""Mrs. Georgieva has solid international experience and knowledge with which she is going to contribute significantly in her capacity as a EU Commissioner"".The confirmation hearing of Georgieva took place at the European Parliament on 4 February 2010. She faced questions on her suitability for the portfolio. Georgieva identified Haiti as a priority, especially the need to provide shelter and health services and to restore the functions and service of the government, so as to start work on reconstruction and long-term development. Other key issues raised in discussions with MEPs had been improving co-ordination within the EU (and within the commission), and between humanitarian and military players in order to meet the dual challenge posed by expanding needs and shrinking budgets. The need to improve the effectiveness of EU actions and for better response capacity had also been stressed, together with the establishment of European Voluntary Humanitarian Corps.Georgieva was given a warm response by MEPs, with Labour MEP Michael Cashman praising her ""honesty and deep breadth of knowledge"". She was applauded by committee members when she told British Conservative MEP Nirj Deva that she would stand up for the interests of the EU and be an independent mind. Ivo Vajgl, a Liberal MEP, also praised her, saying: ""let me compliment you on your peaceful manner and the confidence you are exuding today"". Her performance at the hearing was widely publicized in Bulgaria and broadcast live on many national media, where it was seen as question of restoration of national honor following Jeleva's unsuccessful hearing.The second college of the Barroso Commission, including Georgieva, was approved by the European Parliament on 9 February 2010 by a vote of 488 to 137, with 72 abstentions, and she took office the following day.
TenureGeorgieva tripled funding for the refugee crisis in Europe.  She was involved in coordinating the EU response to the humanitarian consequence of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the earthquake in Chile and the floods in Pakistan. Amid the Southeast Europe floods in May 2014, Georgieva coordinated post-disaster assistance and helped prepare Serbia's request for aid of as much as 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) a year. In May 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed her and Nazrin Shah of Perak as co-chairs of the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing, an initiative aimed at preparing recommendations for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.


=== Vice-President of the European Commission ===
In 2014, news media reported that the ambassadors of several Western EU countries early on indicated their countries' support for Georgieva to be nominated for the incoming Juncker Commission, indicating that she might get the post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Her candidacy had been uncertain because of political infighting in Bulgaria. The collapse of the socialist government, however, cleared the path for her nomination. By August, Georgi Bliznashki, Bulgaria's interim prime minister, announced her candidacy to replace Britain's Catherine Ashton.Incoming European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker instead assigned the post of Vice-President for Budget and Human Resources to Georgieva, with experienced EU civil servant Florika Fink-Hooijer as her Chef de Cabinet. She was thus the most senior technocrat in the Juncker Commission, the only one of the seven vice-presidents never to have served as a national minister. In this role she was in charge of 33,000 staff and reporting on how the budget of the European Union is spent to the European Parliament, the council and the European Court of Auditors. Within months of taking her new position and amid skepticism about the European Union and its budget of around $159 billion reaching new heights, Georgieva was able to negotiate a several-billion-dollar budget increase for 2014.


== World Bank ==
From 1993 to 2010, she served in a number of positions in the World Bank Group, eventually rising to become its vice president and corporate secretary in March 2008. She has also served as a member of the board of trustees and associated professor in the economics department of the University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria. On 27 September 2016, the Bulgarian government nominated Kristalina Georgieva for the post of United Nations Secretary-General. Her short run for secretary-general at the UN ended following a vote at the UN Security Council on 5 October, where Georgieva ranked number eight out of ten candidates. In the same vote, António Guterres got the support of the Security Council for the post of UN Secretary-General.On 28 October 2016, the World Bank announced that Georgieva would become the first CEO of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association starting on 2 January 2017.On 21 April 2018, it was announced the World Bank shareholders endorsed an ambitious package of measures that include a $13 billion paid-in capital increase, a series of internal reforms, and a set of policy measures that greatly strengthen the global poverty fighting institution's ability to scale up resources and deliver on its mission in areas of the world that need the most assistance. Georgieva played a key role in securing this increase, the largest funding increase in the bank's history.On 7 January 2019, it was announced that World Bank Group President Kim would be stepping down and Georgieva would assume the role of interim president of the World Bank Group on 1 February 2019. On 29 September, Georgieva was named the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She was the only nominee for the job and is the first person from an emerging country to hold this office.A 2021 independent inquiry of the World Bank's Doing Business reports by the law firm WilmerHale found that Georgieva instructed staff to alter data to inflate the rankings for China.In October 2021, the International Monetary Fund's executive board initiated an investigations that Georgieva manipulated the Doing Business Report in 2018 during her tenure as World Bank chief. The board later determined that the investigation “did not conclusively demonstrate” that she acted wrongly, and expressed confidence in Georgieva's leadership.


== International Monetary Fund ==
On 29 September 2019, Georgieva was named the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to succeed Christine Lagarde (who was leaving to become the head of the European Central Bank's executive board). She was the only candidate for the job, and is the first person from an emerging economy to serve in the position. IMF tradition was that candidates could not be older than 65 at the start of their term, but following pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron, the rule was waived for Georgieva.Georgieva's term started on 1 October 2019 and will last for five years. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she joined the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccines, Therapeutics, and Diagnostics for Developing Countries, co-chaired by Tedros Adhanom and David Malpass, in July 2021.

On 15 October 2009, the 35th session of the General Conference elected Irina Bokova of Bulgaria as the tenth Director-General of UNESCO. The investiture took place in a ceremony in Room I in the afternoon of Friday 23 October 2009.
On 4 October 2013, the executive board of UNESCO nominated her for second term as Director-General. She was re-elected by the UNESCO General Conference on 12 November 2013.In 2009, while most of the Bulgarian media was supportive of Ms. Bokova's future role at the helm of UNESCO, some raised questions about her past as a daughter of a member of the totalitarian communist elite. Bulgarian-born German writer Iliya Troyanov criticised Bokova's election as Director-General of UNESCO in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, calling it ""a scandal,"" in light of Bokova's father's communist past. On the other hand, The New York Times not only published an article, explaining who Mrs. Bokova is, but also officially supported her nomination on the grounds that ""[s]he played an active role in Bulgaria's political transformation from Soviet satellite to European Union member. That should be a strong asset in leading an organization badly buffeted in the past by ideological storms.""On 16 January 2014, Irina Bokova yielded to pressure from the Arab League and postponed for five months an exhibit entitled The People, the Book, the Land – 3,500 years of ties between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel, following protest from the Arab states in UNESCO, arguing it would harm the peace process. Invitations had already gone out and the exhibit was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January at UNESCO's Paris headquarters with fully prepared exhibition material already in place. In a letter to Bokova, Abdulla al Neaimi, an official from the United Arab Emirates, expressed ""deep worry and great disapproval"" over the program showing the age old connection between Israel and the Jewish people. The US State Department said it was outraged at the move, ""UNESCO's decision is wrong and should be reversed."" Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs said ""is no appropriate rationale to delay the exhibition and deeply disappointed by the decision made to postpone it"". The Wiesenthal Center called the move an ""Absolute outrage, the Arabs don't want the world to know that the Jews have a 3,500-year relationship to the Land of Israel"". The exhibition was opened on 11 June 2014 in Paris, in a ceremony with participation by Mrs. Bokova and the Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier. The exhibit was co-sponsored by Israel, Canada, and Montenegro, and was called ""a breakthrough"" by its author, professor Robert Wistrich. On 18 November 2015 Irina Bokova was given the Special Award of the Simon Wiesenthal Center at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., for the inauguration of the exhibition People, Book, Land: The 3,500 year Relationship of the Jewish People with the Holy Land in the U.S. capital. Bokova inaugurated the exhibition in the presence of Edward Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Israel's Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer and Rabbi Marvin Hier.On 28 March 2015, she launched Unite4Heritage, a campaign aiming to create a global movement ""to protect and safeguard heritage in areas where it is threatened by extremists"". The campaign was triggered by the programmatic destruction of cultural heritage conducted in Iraq and Syria by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) since 2014, in particular after the circulation of videos of looting at Mosul Museum, destruction in the city of Nimrud and the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hatra.
As Director-General of UNESCO, Bokova led efforts to block the trade in Syrian and Iraqi cultural artifacts to fund ISIS and other radical Islamist groups. These efforts led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199 on 12 February 2015. This resolution officially recognized the link between illicit traffic and security, outlawed all trade in cultural goods from Iraq and Syria and requested that UNESCO coordinate efforts in this area with Interpol. In response to the threat to Iraq's antiquities from increased violence and instability, Bokova implemented an emergency plan to safeguard artifacts of Iraq's cultural heritage.On 19 October 2015, German DW reported that Japan threatens to halt funding for UNESCO over the organization's decision to include documents relating to the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in the latest listing for its ""Memory of the World"" program. While the decision is not of the Director-General, a Japanese professor claimed that Mrs. Bokova might have interest in courting China. In October 2016, after opposing an Arab-backed resolution in UNESCO denying Temple Mount's connection to Judaism, Bokova received death threats, prompting her protection to be reinforced.


=== Post-UNESCO work ===
In 2018 it was announced that Irina Bokova will be teaching at the Kyung Hee University in Korea. Kyung Hee University also awarded Bokova an honorary doctorate in Peace Studies, and she assumed the Miwon Professorship and the office of the honorary rector of the Humanitas College.In 2020 she was selected as an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Class V — Public Affairs, Business, and Administration, section Scientific, Cultural, and Nonprofit Leadership.


== United Nations Secretary-General Candidacy ==

Between mid-2014 and end-2016, Bokova was a candidate for the position of UN Secretary General.
In June 2014 the Bulgarian government nominated Irina Bokova to be the official candidate of the country for the United Nations top job.
In January 2015 the new Bulgarian government confirmed the candidacy, although the now-ruling conservative GERB was much less enthusiastic about Bokova than the former Socialist Party government that originally nominated her. That same month former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski wrote in an article at the Wall Street Journal, that her work at UNESCO is ""highly regarded"", and that the Bulgarian government has ""nominated her to succeed Ban Ki-moon as the next U.N. Secretary-General, and she is widely believed to be the frontrunner for that position"".Responding to a Parliamentary question, on 18 May 2015 the Bulgarian foreign minister Daniel Mitov explained the process, undertaken by the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to support Irina Bokova's candidacy. He informed the Bulgarian Parliament that the campaign consists of three stages – information-consultative one – until September 2015, the essential stage – between September 2015 and April 2016, and the last stage – from May 2016 until October–December 2016.
On 9 February 2016 the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced that her candidacy for the top UN job has been officially submitted to the United Nations for consideration. On 11 February Bulgarian media reported that the Foreign Ministry has allocated BGN 106,300 (approx. $60,000 at the time of the publication) for the election campaign.Her campaign ran into troubles after reports that the United Kingdom had opposed her elevation. According to the Government of Russia, Germany began to organize to nominate another Bulgarian – European commissioner Kristalina Georgieva  – as candidate to become Secretary General. It was alleged that German chancellor Angela Merkel put pressure on the government of Bulgaria to abandon Bokova's candidacy and instead nominate Georgieva, and had sought Russian support for this move. Germany categorically denied the allegation.After five informal polls at the UN Security Council, in which Bokova took between third and sixth place, on 28 September 2016, the Bulgarian government announced  that it was nominating Kristalina Georgieva as secretary-general candidate. Since the rules for nominating UN Secretary-General do not provide the option of replacing a candidate, unless they agreed to stand down, which Irina Bokova said she would not do, from 28 September 2016 there were two Bulgarian candidates, with Kristalina Georgieva being the ""sole and unique candidate of Bulgaria"".


=== Statements and positions ===
As a candidate to replace Ban Ki-moon, Bokova participated in informal dialogues at the UN and other conferences to defend her positions and explain her candidature. When prompted by St. Vincent and the Grenadines and an informal dialogue at the UN, Bokova responded by emphasizing her understanding of the problem as she had recently traveled to Haiti, and her acknowledgement of the various UN agencies that have make substantial efforts to cope with this issue.In response to a plenary question on the UN's role in regards to cholera in Haiti at the International Peace Institute, Bokova responded, ""Of course I know about this problem and I know that there is a legal process that is being engaged in currently. I do not know the details of this legal process, I just know that it is going there and I know that there is an idea to establish a fund for indemnities. I will be advocating also for this action to be taken.""On sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers, Bokova made this issue central to her vision statement. ""I am determined to work with governments and the civil society to combat any kind of violence against women and girls... There can be no excuse for the appalling crimes of sexual violence and I consider that the UN has to take the lead in showing strong commitment to ending impunity for violence against women and girls.""On jihadism, she said she would try to get the UN to do more to curb the threat of Isis, saying cultural dialogue and education were key to curbing jihadism which is ""one of the threats to peace, one of the threats to societies,"" adding that ""Isis/Daesh is about the destruction of societies. They pit communities against one another"".


=== Endorsements ===
Bokova's candidacy collected a number of endorsements. In July 2015 The Guardian published an article, titled Will the next UN secretary general be a woman? with a picture of Irina Bokova and a description The head of Unesco, Irina Bokova from Bulgaria, is a favourite to become the UN's new secretary general in 2017.
Bulgarian weekly Capital wrote a page about her candidacy, which states, among other, 

Bokova demonstrates diplomatic and governance skills in a big international organization – UNESCO, which she heads for a second term. She has good reputation to the permanent five members of the UN Security Council. She speaks fluently English, French, Spanish and Russian – four of the six official UN languages (the requirement is for two). She has a clear vision about the mission and activity of the organization.

In July 2015 EurActiv published an article by former Irish Minister for European Affairs and Minister for the Environment Dick Roche, titled The next UN Secretary-General? Bokova ticks all the boxes, arguing in favor of Irina Bokova's candidacy.
On 29 September 2015, David Clark, chairman of the Russia Foundation, published an article in the Financial Times' beyondbrics forum. In it the author comments: ""Of the women from Eastern Europe being discussed is Irina Bokova, the current head of UNESCO and former Bulgarian foreign minister. She is considered to be a front-runner.""
On 2 October 2015, governor Bill Richardson wrote an opinion for The Washington Post, ""The next U.N. secretary general should be a woman"". There he describes women, who are considered as potential candidates. About Bokova, he writes, ""several leading candidates are beginning to emerge. Irina Bokova, director general of UNESCO and Bulgaria’s official candidate, fulfills many of the required criteria and is seen by many as the front-runner. She has taken a strong stance on the fight against extremism and terror financing and is actively championing women empowerment and girls’ education.""On 4 July 2016 the French newspaper L'Opinion published an open letter in support of Irina Bokova's candidacy. The letter was signed by a number of prominent French, among them Christine Albanel, Yann Arthus-Bertrand, Pierre Bergé, Hélène Carrère d’Encausse, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, Yves Coppens, Édith Cresson, Xavier Darcos, Pierre Gattaz, Jean-Michel Jarre, Bariza Khiari, Beate Klarsfeld, Serge Klarsfeld, Julia Kristeva, Catherine Lalumière, Laurence Parisot, Stéphane Richard, Eric de Rothschild. They urged the French President and the French government to support the nomination of Bokova, as this is in the interests of France, and also to promote their position to the other members of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.


== Awards and decorations ==
On 10 June 2016, Bukova received the Global Summit of Women's Global Women's Leadership Award in Warsaw, Poland.On 6 April 2015, the French Embassy in Bulgaria announced that Bokova has been awarded the French Order of the Legion of Honour.On 31 March 2014, Bokova was officially awarded Bulgaria's highest national honour – the Order of Stara Planina (1st class) by president Rosen Plevneliev for her extremely significant merits to Bulgaria, bringing about an improvement in world peace and security indicators, and the development of political and cultural exchanges at the highest levels.

18,"Maria Valcheva Bakalova ( bə-KAH-lo-və; born 4 June 1996) is a Bulgarian actress. She is the recipient of various accolades, including a Critics' Choice Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
Born and raised in Burgas, Bakalova began her career in Bulgarian cinema by starring in film productions while attending the National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts in Sofia. She mostly portrayed dramatic roles in films such as Transgression (2017), The Father (2019), Last Call (2020) and Women Do Cry (2021). Bakalova rose to prominence after starring as the character Tutar Sagdiyev in the 2020 mockumentary Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. Her performance in the film earned her a nomination for an Academy Award, a first for a Bulgarian actress. She subsequently had starring roles in the comedy The Bubble (2022), the slasher film Bodies Bodies Bodies (2022) and the coming-of-age drama Fairyland (2023), and voiced Cosmo the Spacedog in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).


== Life and career ==


=== 1996–2020: Early life and career beginnings ===
Maria Valcheva Bakalova was born on 4 June 1996 in Burgas to Rumyana Bakalova and Valcho Bakalov. She began taking singing lessons and playing the flute around age six. Bakalova enrolled in acting classes at the age of 12, majoring in drama theater and minoring in flute at the National School of Music and Stage Arts in Burgas, where she was a straight A student; she recalled, ""I was a super-disciplined child. I was reading too many books. I was obsessed with Dostoyevsky, at like 15, 16."" As a teenager, Bakalova developed an interest in literature, especially the works of Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges and Mikhail Bulgakov, as a method of escapism. She was inspired to pursue film acting after watching The Hunt, and has cited filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg as her biggest influence alongside Susanne Bier, Pedro Almodóvar, Paolo Sorrentino and Andrea Arnold as other major influences.
Bakalova later moved to Sofia where she majored in drama at the National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts. As a student, she appeared in various stage productions, including Les Liaisons dangereuses, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, Kennedy's Children and The Trial. Bakalova made her on-screen debut playing a supporting part in the 2017 comedy-drama film XIIa. In the same year, she made her first headlining appearance in Transgression, where she played Yana, a young girl who has an unusual relationship with an aging rock musician. She secured the role after a classmate of hers signed her up for a blind audition during her first year at university. The film was screened at several film festivals in Europe and North America, before being released through HBO Max in 2021. In 2018, Bakalova won the award for Best Actress at Toronto's Alternative Film Festival for her performance.
In her third year of studies, she volunteered to help filmmakers Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov, who taught the only film acting class at the academy, with scheduling and other tasks, and traveled with them to the set of a film they were working on so that she could watch how they worked and learn from them. One of the directors invited her to audition for a bit in their film The Father (2019); she landed the part and filmed a brief flashback scene as the young version of one of the characters. The Father won the Crystal Globe award for Best Film at the 54th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and was selected as the Bulgarian entry for the Best International Feature Film category at the 93rd Academy Awards.Driven by her fascination with Danish cinema—particularly with the work of Vinterberg, Lars von Trier and their Dogme 95 movement—Bakalova convinced her parents to take her on a trip to Denmark a few months before graduating. There, she visited Zentropa's headquarters, and asked if she could become a P.A. or a runner on von Trier's next film; she was told that she would have to learn Danish, which she agreed to do. She then began studying the language, before graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree and moving to Los Angeles in 2019. Bakalova next starred in the 2020 comedy-drama Last Call as Alexandra, a suicidal girl who is on the verge of ending her life. Her performance was received positively by critics, and Yanko Terziev of Capital wrote that her portrayal of the character brought ""warmth and lyricism"" to the film.


=== 2020–present: Hollywood breakthrough ===
In 2020, Bakalova portrayed Tutar Sagdiyev, the daughter of fictional Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, in the mockumentary Borat Subsequent Moviefilm alongside Sacha Baron Cohen. Although she was initially credited as Irina Nowak, reports later revealed her involvement. During the audition process, Bakalova had to travel to London for a callback; the secrecy around the project made her concerned that she might have become part of a human trafficking scheme. The film was lauded as ""the most impactful piece of political entertainment"" in the weeks leading up to the 2020 United States presidential election as a scene in which Rudy Giuliani appears to put his hands down his trousers while reclining on a bed in the presence of Bakalova's character garnered significant media attention. Critics praised her performance, with some stating it was among the year's best. Matt Fowler of IGN noted that ""the film's fantastic find, Maria Bakalova, every bit Sacha Baron Cohen's on-screen equal, is who, and what, most people will be talking about."" Los Angeles Times film critic Justin Chang described her performance as ""terrific,"" praising her portrayal of her character's journey ""with madcap energy and touching conviction."" For her performance, Bakalova received several awards, including the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globe Awards. She became the first Bulgarian actress to be nominated for these awards.
Bakalova next starred as Sonja, a 19-year-old girl who discovers she is HIV positive and is in denial about her need for treatment, in Women Do Cry (2021), directed by Mina Mileva and Vesela Kazakova. The film premiered to positive reviews from critics at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed in the Un Certain Regard section, and received a Queer Palm nomination. The same year, Bakalova joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a member of the Actors Branch.In 2022, she starred alongside Amandla Stenberg and Pete Davidson in A24's horror film Bodies Bodies Bodies. The film received predominantly favorable reviews; some felt that her comedic talents were wasted by playing a serious character. Her next role was in Judd Apatow's The Bubble (2022), part of an ensemble cast that included Karen Gillan, David Duchovny, Leslie Mann and Pedro Pascal. The film generated mostly negative reviews, and New York Times critic Ben Kenigsberg wrote that it ""underused"" Bakalova. After voicing Cosmo the Spacedog in The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), she starred in the romantic comedy The Honeymoon (2022), which marked her first production venture. The film saw her play Sarah, whose honeymoon is ruined by her husband's troublesome best friend and who is pursued by the Italian gangster Giorgio, played by Lucas Bravo.Bakalova next appeared in Andrew Durham's directorial debut Fairyland (2023), which premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. She reprised her role as Cosmo the Spacedog in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), and also provided the motion capture performance for the character. With box office takings of $845.6 million worldwide, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was the fourth highest-grossing picture of the year, and became Bakalova's highest-grossing film.Bakalova is slated to make a cameo appearance in Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story. She is also attached to star opposite Alex Pettyfer in the true crime film Branded, based on an article by David Grann for The New Yorker about the origins and expansion of the Aryan Brotherhood.  Bakalova will co-produce and lead Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov's Triumph, and star in Electra alongside Daryl Wein, Jack Farthing and Abigail Cowen. In November 2022, she joined the cast of the action thriller film Dirty Angels, directed by Martin Campbell. She will also star in Madeleine Sackler's sci-fi comedy drama O Horizon.


== Public image ==
In 2020, Variety included Bakalova in their ""10 Actors to Watch"" list, while The New York Times named her as one of 2020's breakout stars. Since 2021, she has worked closely with Louis Vuitton's creative director Nicolas Ghesquière. In 2021, she appeared on two of Forbes magazine's annual 30 Under 30 lists, which recognise the 30 most influential people in Europe under the age of 30. The same year, W featured her in their annual ""Best Performances"" issue, and Variety named her among the women who have made an impact on the global entertainment industry. Bakalova has topped Forbes Bulgaria's ""Top 70 Bulgarian Celebrities"" list twice.Bakalova is an advocate for Bulgarian and Eastern European representation in Hollywood. She is the co-founder of the production company Five Oceans, which aims to bring Bulgarian, Balkan and Slavic stories to international audiences, alongside Julian Kostov. At the 27th Critics' Choice Awards, Bakalova voiced her support for Ukraine, and called for ""a new era of cultural and artistic exchange between Eastern Europe and Hollywood"".

24,"Rumiana Ruseva Jeleva (Bulgarian: Румяна Русева Желева; born 18 April 1969) was Bulgaria's minister of foreign affairs (July 2009 – January 2010), the third woman to hold this office after Irina Bokova and Nadezhda Mihailova. Jeleva was a key figure in the ""GERB"" political party which won the 2009 parliamentary elections. From 2007 to 2009, she served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and headed the Bulgarian delegation in the EPP Group. She was nominated by Prime Minister Boyko Borisov as Commissioner in the ""Barroso II Commission"" and was affiliated with the European People's Party (EPP). However, an article in the German newspaper Die Welt accused her husband of links with the Russian mafia.Jeleva holds a B.A. in sociology from the University of Sofia (1995) and a PhD in sociology from Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg (2003).


== Pronunciation ==
The Bulgarian pronunciation of the name Jeleva is [ˈʒɛlɛvɐ], with the [ʒ]-sound of English pleasure (voiced palato-alveolar fricative). According to the current official standards for the Romanization of Bulgarian, her name should be transliterated as ""Zheleva"". Because of this confusion, some people erroneously pronounce the name with a y-sound, [j].


== Failure in EC hearings and end of political career ==
Jeleva was Bulgaria's nominee for European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. During her January 2010 confirmation hearing, she repeatedly failed to answer questions regarding allegations over her financial interests. She also failed to demonstrate sufficient competence in the areas she was to oversee. Her defensive and seemingly arrogant attitude and her poor language skills further jeopardized her candidacy. Facing a storm of disapproval at home, on 19 January 2010, Jeleva sent a letter of resignation to Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, stepping down as both commissioner-designate and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and putting an end to her political career. She was replaced as commissioner-designate by Kristalina Georgieva and as Minister of Foreign Affairs by Nickolay Mladenov.

== The project WhyNot? / ProcByNe? ==
As a new MEP, the first thing she thought of was to start concrete projects which would have a direct and immediate impact on European citizens, especially young people. Taking into account the concerning rates of youth unemployment, she decided to launch her personal traineeship programme ""PročBynNe?"" - ""Why not?"". Putting effectively into use the business and academic network that she knows well from her previous profession, she offers around 12 traineeships per year to motivated young people to enable them to strive for their goals as well as to give them assurances that if they want to achieve something in life, they can do it. The selection of youngsters (aged 18–25) is not based on the highest qualifications but on the biggest motivation to do the job.  The traineeships can vary from shadowing for two weeks the Minister of Finance to learning the best recipes of the top chef of the country or mentoring by master craftsmen. A separate website was launched introducing the project - www.procbyne.cz. A further idea is to bring this traineeship scheme from the Czech Republic to other EU countries – using a similar young person-MEP-business/academia formula. It is a symbolic act to help young people to get their first job experience and to show that even by small actions, we can make a difference.
