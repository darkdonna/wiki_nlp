7,"Barbara Maria Blida, née Szwajnoch (3 December 1949 – 25 April 2007) was a Polish political figure who served in the nation's Parliament (Sejm) for 16 years (1989–2005), including a stint as a member of the cabinet, and whose suicide in the midst of an investigation for corruption became front-page news in Poland as well as in a number of news outlets around the world.


== Early years ==
A native of the city of Siemianowice Śląskie, an administrative center of the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia, Barbara Maria Szwajnoch joined, in 1969, at the age of 20, Polish United Workers' Party, the name used by the Communist Party ruling Poland since the period following World War II.  Family tradition to the contrary, she remained a member until the Party's termination and restructuring twenty years later.   From 1968 to 1977 she was employed as a workplace safety specialist at the Chorzów nitrogen works and, by 1976, had graduated from the Silesian University of Technology with a major in sanitary engineering.


== Political career ==
Using her married name, Barbara Blida, she was elected to the Sejm as a member of the Workers' Party in June 1989 and served for six consecutive terms, until 2005.  Seven months after taking her seat, following the January 1990 dissolution of the Party in the context of the 1990–91 fall of Communism, she continued as a member of the Party's political successors, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (1990–99) and Democratic Left Alliance (1999–2004) and, having resigned from the Alliance in 2004, served out her last year as an independent member. During her service in the Sejm, she was appointed, on 26 October 1993, to the cabinet of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak as Minister for Construction and Spatial Management and served in that capacity in subsequent governments of Józef Oleksy and Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz until 31 December 1996, when the ministry was transformed into the Central Office for Housing and Municipal Development, with Blida remaining in charge until Cimoszewicz's government ended its term on 17 October 1997. The ministry ended with her and, three years later was restored as Ministry of Regional Development and Construction, headed by Jerzy Kropiwnicki.  Following tenure as a member of the cabinet, she continued as a member of the Sejm for eight years, but also ventured into business, becoming, in 2001, the president of J.W. Construction sp. z o.o., one of Poland's largest real-estate developers.


== Accusation of corruption followed by suicide ==
According to media accounts and later official reports, Barbara Blida was named as one of the officials who received illegal payments from businesswoman Barbara Kmiecik, one of the richest women in the country during the 1990s, whom the press had dubbed ""Alexis of Polish mining"" or ""Alexis of Silesia"", after the money/power-hungry ""Alexis Carrington"" character on the then-popular prime-time soap Dynasty.  Following her 2005 arrest for corrupting public officials involved with the so-called ""coal mafia"", Kmiecik allegedly named a number of officials, including Barbara Blida, although the authorities did not release any names, nor details of Kmiecik's revelations.
On the early morning of Wednesday, 25 April 2007, representatives of ABW (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego [Agency of Internal Security]) entered Blida's house in Siemianowice Śląskie with a prosecutor's warrant to arrest her and search the house for evidence. According to ABW reports, during the search, she asked for permission to use the bathroom, where she shot herself through the heart using her Astra 680 revolver, with subsequent resuscitation efforts by ABW agents proving to be fruitless.


== Aftermath ==
Barbara Blida, who was 57 years old at the time of her suicide, became the top news item in the Polish media that day, and sparked many comments and controversies, which were also voiced during a special Sejm session. ABW was accused of unprofessional handling of the matter, especially for not ascertaining that Blida relinquished the weapon, since it was public knowledge that she was granted a permit for and owned one after threats on her life in previous years. Some sources also purported that her death could not come as a result of planned suicide, but rather from a scuffle with ABW agents, an accusation promptly dismissed by the officials.  Opposition leaders subsequently called for the resignation of Minister Zbigniew Wassermann, the Secret Services Coordinator, but during a hearing in the Sejm he announced he had no intentions of resigning and stated that Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński should, instead, suspend the chief of ABW.

57,"Manuela Gretkowska (6 October 1964) is a Polish writer, screenwriter, feminist and politician. She is the foundress of the Feminist Initiative.


== Biography ==
Manuela Gretkowska was born in Łódź and studied philosophy at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. In 1988, she left Poland to live in Paris, where she studied anthropology at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales.  In the early 1990s, she returned to her country, where she was deputy editor-in-chief and then literary director at Elle.  She wrote columns for Elle, Cosmopolitan, Wprost, Polityka, Machina, and Cogito.
Gretkowska's literary debut was the novel We Are Immigrants Here (My zdies' emigranty) (1991), in which she described the experiences of the young generation leaving Poland.  The work of the young artist was favorably reviewed by Czesław Miłosz, whose preface appeared in the first edition.  Gretkowska's next three books described the life of a modern artistic-intellectual bohemian living in France: Paris Tarot (1993), Metaphysical Cabaret (1994), and Textbook for people. Skull: The First and Last Volume (1996) connects gnosis, kabbala, the character of Mary Magdalene and the skull motif in global culture.  In this period, the writer earned the title of ""scandalist"" and ""postmodernist.""  Manuela Gretkowski's prose eschewed grandiose language, more similar to the ease and austerity of the essay.  In 1996, Gretkowska wrote a screenplay for the Andrzej Żuławski film Szamanka (She-Shaman).
In 1997, Gretkowska moved to Sweden, where she published several collected stories in the book Namiętnik (The Passionate One) (1998), notes from her world travels in Światowidz (World-View) (1998), and her columns, under the collective title Silikon (Silicon) (2000).  She also co-wrote the screenplay for the first season of the TV series Miasteczko (Small Town) (2000).
Gretkowska's newest work is more personal, almost intimate prose.  Polka (Polish woman) (2001) was the writer's pregnancy journal, while Europejka (European Woman) (2004) presents a humorous view of a changing Poland through the eyes of Gretkowska the intellectual.  In 2003 the author, together with her partner Piotr Pietucha wrote Scenes from Extramarital Life. Three years later, Gretkowska wrote a column for the monthly magazine Success that was highly critical of the Kaczyński brothers (twins who at the time held the positions of Poland's President and Prime Minister).  The issue hit stands with this text cut out (literally) of every copy.
She lives in Ustanow (near Warsaw) with her daughter Pola and the writer and psychotherapist Piotr Pietucha.


=== Women's Party ===
In 2007, Gretkowska transformed the social movement ""Poland is a Woman"" into a new Political party - the Women's Party (Partia Kobiet), from which she ran a failed campaign in the Polish and European parliaments.  In October 2007, after the party's defeat in the parliamentary elections, she resigned the party's leadership but remains an ""honorary leader"".

58,"Anna Grodzka (born 16 March 1954) is a Polish politician. A trans woman, she was elected to the Sejm in the 2011 Polish parliamentary elections as a candidate for the left-liberal Palikot's Movement, and was the first openly transgender Member of Parliament in Poland, and the third openly transgender member of a national parliament worldwide, after Georgina Beyer (in office 1999–2005) and Vladimir Luxuria (2006–2008). She was believed to be the only remaining transgender member of parliament until Nikki Sinclaire (in office 2009–2015) outed herself in November 2013.
In June 2014, Anna Grodzka joined Poland's Green Party but left a year later. In 2019, she became a member of PPS, which she also left soon after criticizing the party's chairman.

59,"Hanna Beata Gronkiewicz-Waltz (Polish pronunciation: [ˈxanna bɛˈata ɡrɔnˈkʲɛvid͡ʐ ˈvalt͡s] , born 4 November 1952) is a Polish politician and lawyer, Professor of Jurisprudence and politician who served as the city mayor of Warsaw between 2006 and 2018. She is the first and so far only woman to have held this position.


== Life and career ==
Between 1992 and 2000, she was the chairman of the National Bank of Poland, the central bank of Poland. She resigned to take the position of the deputy chairman of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a position she held between 2001 and 2004.
Gronkiewicz-Waltz was elected to the Sejm on 25 September 2005 after receiving 137,280 votes in the 19th Warsaw district, running on the Civic Platform list.
In the 2006 municipal elections, Gronkiewicz-Waltz served as Civic Platform's nominee for mayor of Warsaw. On 12 November she gained 34.23%, finishing next to Law and Justice candidate, former prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. As neither received 50 percent of the vote, a second round election was held on 26 November, where Gronkiewicz-Waltz received 53.18% of the votes, winning the election.

In January 2007, just a few weeks into her term, Gronkiewicz-Waltz was at the center of a controversy that could have cost her the office. A law enacted in 2005 obliged the mayors of Polish municipalities to publicly disclose their own as well as their spouse's financial circumstances. The law requires the successful candidate's disclosure statement to be provided within 30 days after the inauguration, whereas the statement regarding the candidate's spouse is to be submitted within 30 days after the actual election. Gronkiewicz-Waltz submitted her own and her husband's statements on 2 January 2007, exactly 30 days after her inauguration. On 20 January, the newspaper Dziennik reported that Mr Waltz's documents had been two days past the deadline, which in his case had been on 28 December 2006. Based on this, Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party maintained that Gronkiewicz-Waltz's mandate had expired on 28 December 2006, and announced that the local elections would be repeated. Gronkiewicz-Waltz's party Civic Platform argued that the prime minister did not have the authority to make this decision, and that the case would need to be examined in court instead. Polish legal experts maintained that by submitting their statements on the same day, Gronkiewicz-Waltz had observed the spirit, if not the letter of the law. Also, having two different deadlines for the statements could be considered as an unconstitutional legal trap. In the meantime, Civic Platform announced that it would nominate Gronkiewicz-Waltz again, should the elections need to be repeated. On 13 March 2007, Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled against the governing Law and Justice party and struck down the controversial law that threatened her and many other public officials with the loss of their positions solely because they did not file paperwork on time.
Regarding the Equality Parade for LGBT rights in the capital, Gronkiewicz-Waltz has taken the opposite stand to her predecessor, approving it. Though equality marches have been officially allowed in the past, they had always met with strong resistance during the term of Lech Kaczyński as Mayor of Warsaw, particularly from the All-Polish Youth movement. Gronkiewicz-Waltz said the parade would pose no threat to morals and pointed to the Bączkowski v Poland ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that Kaczyński had acted illegally and discriminatory in banning the 2005 Equality Parade. [1]
In the November 2010 municipal elections, Gronkiewicz-Waltz was re-elected as the mayor (or ""president"") of Warsaw, winning 53.67% of the votes outright in the first round, making a second round unnecessary.
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was along with Monika Olejnik, an influential journalist, a murder target of Brunon Kwiecień, who was arrested in November 2012 in connection with the preparation of a terrorist attack on Sejm.Gronkiewicz-Waltz is a Fellow of Collegium Invisibile as a professor of economics.

65,"Iwona Hartwich (née Zielińska; born 6 September 1970) is a Polish disability rights activist and politician. A key organiser of the 2014 and 2018 Polish disability protests, Hartwich was elected to the Sejm in 2019, representing constituency no. 5 in Toruń.


== Personal life ==
Hartwich is from Toruń. After training as a salesperson at the School of Economics in Toruń, she married and had two children. Her eldest son Jakub (born 1994) has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Following his birth, Hartwich was unable to return to work and cared for Jakub. Jakub has taken part in protests with his mother.


== Disability rights activism ==
In 2008, Hartwich started posting on the online forum Razem Możemy Więcej (English: ""together we can do more""), in which parents and carers of disabled children could seek support. Many posts were around the low amount of złoty paid to support carers; Hartwich herself was unable to receive the benefit due to her earning 50 zł (£9) over the maximum threshold. With other members of the forum, in 2009 Hartwich organised a protest outside the Warsaw offices of the then-Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, with the slogan ""samą miłością dzieci nie nakarmimy"" (""we can't feed our children with love""). Tusk subsequently raised the carer payments by 100 zł and abolished the income criteria.Hartwich subsequently founded Mam Przyszłość (""I have a future""), an organisation aimed at supporting disabled people and their carers, in response to her belief that the Polish government was not taking carers' concerns seriously. In 2011, she led protests outside the offices of Tusk and Bartosz Arłukowicz, the Minister of Health. She subsequently met with Jacek Kwiatkowski and Ewa Kopacz, and subsequently a law was passed increasing carer payments to 820 zł.In March and April 2014, Hartwich led 17 days of continual sit-in protests of the Sejm, during which time she called for an increase in state payments made to carers; she stated she was inspired to do so after Tusk went back on promises he had made about maintaining the level of payments in line with inflation. She declined Tusk's initial offer of raising carer payments to match minimum wage over a period of several years; the protest ended when the government agreed to make the match immediately.In April and May 2018, Hartwich led 40 days of sit-in protests, calling on the social pension to be raised; this was ultimately implemented by the government, alongside the introduction of an allowance for adults with disabilities unable to live independently. Following this protest, Hartwich was issued with a ban from entering the Sejm until 2020.


== Political career ==
In 2019, Hartwich was selected as a list candidate for the Civic Coalition for constituency no. 5 in Toruń. After being placed seventh in the list, Hartwich threatened to withdraw her candidacy; following talks with Grzegorz Schetyna, she was placed third on the list. She was ultimately elected to the Sejm in the 2019 parliamentary election, receiving 10,865 votes.
