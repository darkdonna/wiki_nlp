She became a founding member of its legal successor, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) on 15 November 1989, and participated in the establishment of its local branch in Pécs. She ran as a candidate in the 1990 parliamentary election in Pécs (Constituency II, Baranya County), and finished third in the second round, while András Pap (MDF) obtained the mandate. She was elected to the municipal assembly of Pécs during a by-election in 1992.She was also nominated individual candidate in Pécs (Constituency II), but her name also appeared at the first place on the regional county list of MSZP during the 1994 parliamentary election. She obtained the mandate in the constituency, defeating Tibor Németh (SZDSZ) and András Pap (MDF). After Gyula Horn formed his MSZP–SZDSZ coalition government, she served as the secretary of state for political affairs in the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development (under minister Ferenc Baja) from 15 July 1994 to 7 July 1998. At that time she was also a member of the Council of the National Technical Development Committee (OMFB). She was elected chairperson of the local branch of her party in Pécs in 1997. A year later, she became president of the party's national women section.

Szili was re-elected MP for Pécs (Constituency II) in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 parliamentary elections. She served as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly between 1998 and 2002. Following the 2002 parliamentary election, Szili was elected Speaker of the National Assembly, becoming the second woman, who held the office. She was re-elected as Speaker in 2006.She was the candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party for presidency in the 2005 Hungarian presidential election. Szili lost the election on 7 June 2005 to opposition nominee László Sólyom. The Hungarian Constitution prescribes that the President must be elected by the National Assembly of Hungary, thus the victory of the opposition came as something of a surprise.  The junior coalition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), however, had long emphasized that it would not vote for a partisan President.  Szili as a high-ranking member of the Socialist party was considered partisan, the SZDSZ abstained, enabling the more neutral candidate Sólyom (who was originally nominated by a non-governmental organization Védegylet and later supported by the opposition), to win the office. Another reason for the failed nomination was that SZDSZ was not consulted ahead of time and Szili lacked qualifications compared to Sólyom who previously held high office as the president of the Constitutional Court of Hungary.
In 2009 Szili was the mayoral candidate of MSZP for the mayor of a major Hungarian city, Pécs. She lost the election to Zsolt Páva. She came to be considered inner opposition inside the MSZP since 2009 (some considered she had prominent role in the leakage of the Őszöd speech three years earlier). In 2009 Szili resigned from her position as speaker of Parliament, She was succeeded by Béla Katona of MSZP. She formed the Movement of Alliance for the Future in 2010 and had her own candidates in some areas in the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election. Szili was elected to the Parliament of Hungary via the Baranya County Party list where she was chairperson of the local MSZP branch.


=== Independent MP ===
After the 2010 local elections, held on 3 October, she founded the Social Union (SZU) and became its first chairperson. As a result, she quit the Hungarian Socialist Party and their parliamentary group, continuing her parliamentary work as a formally independent MP. However, as an elected parliamentarian she filled a four-year term ending in 2014. Thus the new party Social Union instantly had some representation in Parliament, which is usually not possible for parties having won less than 5% of votes.
In 2011 Szili became a member of the Nemzeti Konzultációs Testület (National Consultative body) preparing the new 
constitution. Later, she presented her own proposal. Szili was appointed Chairperson of the Committee on Sustainable Development on 25 February 2013.
On 17 October 2013, Szili and her party, the Social Union (SZU), entered into an alliance with 11 other parties and civil groups (including Centre Party) and established Community for Social Justice People's Party (KTI). Her new party did not reach the 5% threshold contrary in the 2014 parliamentary election, as a result she lost her parliamentary seat after 20 years.


=== Supporter of Viktor Orbán ===
Following the 2014 national election, Szili gradually switched to Fidesz, and became a vocational supporter of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who retained his two-third majority in the Hungarian parliament. Upon the request of Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén, she was appointed Prime Ministerial Commissioner on 1 March 2015. Her task covers ""coordination tasks related to the aspirations of autonomy in the Carpathian Basin and the concepts of autonomy of social, political and non-governmental organizations, in cooperation with the State Secretariat for National Policy of the Prime Minister's Office, and liaison with European Union and international organizations.""She voted ""no"" in the 2016 migrant quota referendum, because she ""supports the long-term protection of the entire European Judeo-Christian cultural community"". In a 2017 interview, she denied allegations that she had negotiated with Fidesz, betrayed the left, or that she would be a socialist ""decorative finch"" for Fidesz, stating she was doing important work for the nation, not a member of the MSZP since 2010, and she is criticized by those who have a ""bad conscience"" in national affairs (regarding the 2004 dual citizenship referendum). She explained the failures of her later small parties (SZU, KTI) by a lack of financial means. Szili actively campaigned for Fidesz during the 2018 parliamentary election. Szili stated just before the 2019 European Parliament election that the election will be a ""struggle between supporters and opponents of migration"", quoting the words of Viktor Orbán.In order to remain a member of the board of trustees of the University of Pécs, she resigned as Prime Ministerial Commissioner in February 2023. However, soon, she was appointed chief advisor to the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, which raised the issue of evasion of conflict of interest legislation. She joined the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), the coalition partner of the ruling Fidesz, on 31 March 2023.

13,"Éva Tétényi (born 25 December 1961) is a Hungarian politician, who served as the mayor of Esztergom between 2010 and 2014. Tétényi formerly worked as an architect.


== Politics ==
She was born 25 December 1961 in Esztergom, Hungary. Before her political career, Tétényi worked as an architect. She was the chief architect of the 6th district of Budapest, and later the chief architect of Győr-Moson-Sopron County, and was the member of the executive board of the Architects' Council of Europe.
Tétényi ran for mayor of Esztergom during the 2010 municipal elections with several parties urging their voters to support Tétényi. Jobbik, Politics Can Be Different (LMP) and Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) were among those who provided such support. Tétényi, thanks to her broad support, was elected with two-thirds of the votes, against the Fidesz-supported Tamás Meggyes. As there was no similar agreement between the Tétényi supporting parties for city council (Jobbik, MSZP, LMP each ran separate candidates there), the election for city council was won by the Fidesz party, which holds two-thirds of the seats there. Tétényi is not a member of any political party.
Since in the Hungarian political system most of the power in local government was delegated to the council as opposed to one person mayoral rule, this caused constant conflict between the mayor and the council. The city council with votes from the Fidesz party illegally restricted the powers of the mayor, and her immediate co-workers were fired one by one.Tétényi several times proposed disbanding the council. Tétényi then announced violating the law, claiming it was her right as civil disobedience, and refused to chair the council meetings except for decisions about the debt settlement and the reorganization plan. With no vice-mayor present due to an earlier resignation and Tétényi's refusal to consent to the appointment of any new vice-mayors, this meant that there is nobody legally able to chair council meetings. This effectively had shut down the local government in Esztergom completely. The shutdown occurred at a time when the city was struggling to meet its financial obligations and a possible default would mean the loss of all properties owned by the city. Tétényi claimed the reason for her actions is the city council's inability to cooperate with her as the elected mayor. Tétényi remained highly popular among the citizens of Esztergom, she also won the election by a large margin.
During the June 2011 Tétényi made several demands such as the resignation of three members of the city council and the appointment of Jobbik politician Andrea Stámusz as vice mayor. These she said would help resolve the situation. A significant issue facing the city government was debt restructuring, with total debt reaching 25 bn HUF, caused by the previous mayor, Meggyes. In 2011 the companies owned by Esztergom wrote an open letter to Tétényi, publicly asking her to end the shutdown of the local government and call the city council together and chair the meetings. Several actions regarding their functioning such as review and acceptance of the balance sheet requires a council vote. The letter said they will regard Tétényi as personally responsible for the monetary and other damages (such as a possible violation of Cth law of 2000. on accounting). In July 2011 an LMP politician, Gergely Karácsony, proposed an election coalition between Jobbik-LMP-MSZP, to change certain laws enacted by Fidesz. He cited Éva Tétényi's case, as a precedent of how such a proposal could work.Tétényi ran for mayor of Esztergom during the 2014 municipal elections for the second time as an independent candidate. She was also supported by DK and Együtt–PM, however Jobbik had an own mayoral candidate in 2014. Éva Tétényi lost to Etelka Romanek (Fidesz–KDNP) and came to the second place with 43.39 percent of the votes.


== Controversy ==
In July 2011 Tétényi called his political opponents ""retards"". She also threatened physical violence against them, saying ""one by one you should be beaten"". Tétényi's words were recorded and played for the press. The statements caused controversy as they stepped across the usual boundaries of political discourse. The political opponents of Tétényi also received death threats at the time signed from the ""Man from Esztergom"". Tétényi didn't distance herself from the threats when asked to do so. Tétényi said that even though the discussion took place in a TV studio, it was after the end of the TV program, making her words part of a private conversation. Tétényi have asked the government to appoint a governmental overseer, to watch over the affairs of Esztergom.
