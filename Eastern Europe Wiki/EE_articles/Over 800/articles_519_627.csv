This is not surprising, as the Ukrainian diaspora has a very large influence in Canada. Therefore, Canadians will be the last after Ukraine to recognize Russian athletes at the Olympics.

Next season she missed internationally, but on 2 March 2007, she debuted in Biathlon World Cup by finishing 44th in sprint in Lahti, Finland. She was enrolled in the national team for all three last World Cup stages that season but didn't gain any points. She didn't get a quota in the national team in 2007–08 season. That time she spent competing at Biathlon European Championships and junior competitions.
In 2008–09 season, she took part regularly in the relay team, and on 7 January 2009, she was in the winning relay team in German Oberhof.
She represented Ukraine at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Her best result at that Games was rank 12 in mass start.

In the first sprint race of that season on 1 December 2012, Olena finished third in Östersund, Sweden, and was second in pursuit in Italian Antholz-Anterselva in January 2013. Later on, Pidhrushna took a hat-trick of medals at the 2013 Biathlon World Championships, where she won the gold in the sprint, was part of the women's relay team which won silver, and secured a bronze in the pursuit. For these achievements, she was named Ukraine's best sportswoman of 2013. That season she ended ranking 8th in World Cup general classification.

On 30 November 2014, she gave an interview for biathlon.com.ua, stating: ""I took break in my sport career for a decree only. I can't do anything before the time the child will be born... so I must do something... I want fans to understand my decision and wait. I hope to be back in future, after the child will be born..."" So she returned in November 2015. Her attempts to have a child were then unsuccessful. Later she divorced her husband.

She returned in 2015–16 season, which she started with two bronze medals in sprint and individual race in Swedish Östersund. In mid-February she won sprint in Canmore, Canada. That year she achieved her best World Cup ranking – 7. Next season Pidhrushna didn't have plenty of good results, and she missed all races in March.

She has been a member of the Verkhovna Rada as People's Deputy of Ukraine several times between 1997 and 2007, and presently as of 2014, and was First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine for the fuel and energy complex from 1999 to 2001. She has the degree of Candidate of Economic Sciences.Tymoshenko is the leader of the Batkivshchyna (Ukrainian: Батьківщина) political party. She supports Ukraine's integration into the European Union and strongly opposes the membership of Ukraine in the Russia-led Eurasian Customs Union. She supports NATO membership for Ukraine.She co-led the Orange Revolution and was the first woman twice appointed and endorsed by parliamentary majority to become prime minister, serving from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 4 March 2010. She placed third in Forbes magazine's list of the world's most powerful women in 2005.Tymoshenko finished second in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election runoff, losing by 3.5 percentage points to the winner, Viktor Yanukovych. From 2011 to 2014 she was detained due to a criminal case that was seen by many as politically motivated persecution by President Viktor Yanukovych, but after the Revolution of Dignity she was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. In the concluding days of the Revolution of Dignity, she was released after three years in jail. She again finished second in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, this time to Petro Poroshenko. After being a heavy favorite in the polls for several years, she came third in the first round of the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, receiving 13.40% of the vote, thus failing to qualify for the second round.Elected to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) in 2019, she led her party in opposition.


== Early life and career ==
Tymoshenko was born Yulia Hrihyan on 27 November 1960, in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. Her mother, Lyudmila Telehina (née Nelepova), was born on 11 August 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. Yulia's father, Volodymyr Hrihyan, who according to his Soviet Union passport was Latvian, was born on 3 December 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. He abandoned his wife and young daughter when Yulia was between one and three years old; Yulia used her mother's surname.Yulia's paternal grandfather, Abram Kapitelman (Ukrainian: Абрам Кельманович Капітельман), was born in 1914. After graduating from Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1940, Kapitelman was sent to work in Western Ukraine, where he worked ""one academic quarter"" as the director of a public Jewish school in the city Sniatyn. Kapitelman was mobilized into the army in the autumn of 1940 and subsequently was killed while taking part in the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) on 8 November 1944, with the rank of ""lieutenant"" in Signal corps.


=== Education ===
In 1977, Tymoshenko graduated from high school No. 75 in Dnipropetrovsk. Tymoshenko constantly helps the school. In 1978, Tymoshenko was enrolled in the Automatization and Telemechanics Department of the Dnipropetrovsk Mining Institute. In 1979, she transferred to the Economics Department of the Dnipropetrovsk State University, majoring in cybernetic engineering and graduating in 1984 with first degree honors as an engineer-economist.In 1999, she defended her PhD dissertation, titled State Regulation of the tax system, at the Kyiv National Economic University and received a Ph.D. in economics.


=== Commercial career ===
Tymoshenko has worked as a practicing economist and academic. Prior to her political career, she became a successful but controversial businesswoman in the gas industry, becoming by some estimates one of the richest people in the country. Before becoming Ukraine's first female prime minister in 2005, Tymoshenko co-led the Orange Revolution. She was placed third in Forbes magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women 2005.After graduating from the Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1984, Tymoshenko worked as an engineer-economist in the ""Dnipro Machine-Building Plant"" (which produced missiles) in Dnipropetrovsk until 1988.In 1988, as part of the perestroika initiatives, Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko borrowed 5,000 roubles and opened a video-rental cooperative, perhaps with the help of Oleksander's father, Gennadi Tymoshenko, who presided over a regional film-distribution network in the provincial council.From 1989 to 1991, Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko founded and led a commercial video-rental company ""Terminal"" in Dnipropetrovsk,In 1991, Tymoshenko established (jointly with her husband Oleksandr, Gennadi Tymoshenko, and Olexandr Gravets) ""The Ukrainian Petrol Corporation"", a company that supplied the agriculture industry of Dnipropetrovsk with fuel from 1991 to 1995. Tymoshenko worked as a general director. In 1995, this company was reorganized into United Energy Systems of Ukraine. Tymoshenko served as the president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a privately owned middleman company that became the main importer of Russian natural gas to Ukraine, from 1995 to 1 January 1997. During that time she was nicknamed  the ""gas princess"". She was also accused of ""having given Pavlo Lazarenko kickbacks in exchange for her company's stranglehold on the country's gas supplies"", although Judge Martin Jenkins of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on 7 May 2004, dismissed the allegations of money laundering and conspiracy regarding UESU, Somoli Ent. et al. (companies affiliated with Yulia Tymoshenko) in connection with Lazarenko's activities. During this period, Tymoshenko was involved in business relations (either co-operative or hostile) with many important figures of Ukraine. Tymoshenko also had to deal with the management of the Russian corporation, Gazprom. Tymoshenko claims that, under her management, UESU successfully solved significant economic problems: from 1995 to 1997, Ukraine's multi-billion debt for Russian natural gas was paid; Ukraine resumed international cooperation in machine building, the pipe industry and construction; and Ukraine's export of goods to Russia doubled. In the period of 1995 to 1997, Tymoshenko was considered one of the richest business people in Ukraine. When Tymoshenko made her initial foray into national politics, her company became an instrument of political pressure on her and on her family. UESU top management faced prosecution. Since 1998, Tymoshenko has been a prominent politician in Ukraine. She was not included in the list of ""100 richest Ukrainians"" in 2006.


== Political career ==


=== Early career ===
Tymoshenko entered politics in 1996, when she was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) in constituency No. 229, Bobrynets, Kirovohrad Oblast, winning a record 92.3% of the vote. In Parliament, Tymoshenko joined the Constitutional Centre faction. In February 1997 this centrists faction was 56 lawmakers strong and, according to Ukrainska Pravda, at first it supported the policies of Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. In late 1997, Tymoshenko called for impeachment and the next Ukrainian Presidential elections to be held not in 1999, but in the fall of 1998. In late November 1997, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine asked the Verkhovna Rada to lift Tymoshenko's parliamentary immunity, but the deputies voted against it.Tymoshenko was re-elected in 1998, winning a constituency in the Kirovohrad Oblast, and was also number six on the party list of Hromada. She became an influential person in the parliament, and was appointed the Chair of the Budget Committee of the Verkhovna Rada. After Hromada's party leader Pavlo Lazarenko fled to the United States in February 1999 to avoid investigations for embezzlement, various faction members left Hromada to join other parliamentary factions, among them Tymoshenko, who set up the All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland"" faction in March 1999 in protest against the methods of Lazarenko. ""Fatherland"" was officially registered as a political party in September 1999, and began to attract the voters who had voted for Yevhen Marchuk in the October 1999 presidential election. In 2000, ""Fatherland"" went in opposition to President Kuchma.


==== Deputy Prime Minister for fuel and energy ====
From late December 1999 to January 2001, Tymoshenko was the Deputy Prime Minister for the fuel and energy sector in the cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko. She officially left parliament on 2 March 2000. Under her guidance, Ukraine's revenue collections from the electricity industry grew by several thousand percent. She scrapped the practice of barter in the electricity market, requiring industrial customers to pay for their electricity in cash. She also terminated exemptions for many organizations which excluded them from having their power disconnected. Her reforms meant that the government had sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries.
In 2000, Tymoshenko's government provided an additional 18 billion hryvna for social payments. Half of this amount was collected due to withdrawal of funds from shadow schemes, the ban on barter payments and the introduction of competition rules to the energy market.On 18 August 2000, Oleksandr Tymoshenko, CEO of United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) and Yulia Tymoshenko's husband, was detained and arrested. Tymoshenko herself stated that her husband's arrest was the result of political pressure on her. On 19 January 2001, President Leonid Kuchma ordered Yulia Tymoshenko to be dismissed. Then, Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko silently accepted her dismissal, despite her achievements in the energy sector. Ukrainian media called it ""the first betrayal of Viktor Yushchenko"". Soon after her dismissal, Tymoshenko took leadership of the National Salvation Committee and became active in the Ukraine without Kuchma protests. The movement embraced a number of opposition parties, such as Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, ""Fatherland"", Ukrainian Republican Party, Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, ""Sobor"", Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party, Ukrainian Christian-Democratic Party and Patriotic Party.


=== Campaigns against Kuchma and 2002 election ===
On 9 February 2001, Tymoshenko founded the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (the National Salvation Committee merged into it), a political bloc that received 7.2% of the vote in the 2002 parliamentary election. She has been head of the Batkivshchina (Fatherland) political party since the party was organised in 1999.On 13 February 2001, Tymoshenko was arrested and charged with forging customs documents and smuggling gas in 1997 (while president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine). Her political supporters organized numerous protest rallies near the Lukyanivska Prison where she was held in custody.In a letter to the editor of the British newspaper Financial Times, Tymoshenko claimed that the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma was consciously building a totalitarian system in the country:
I believe that Mr Kuchma's regime may go so far as to eliminate me physically, not just politically, but I have made my choice and will continue to fight him by democratic methods. President Kuchma says I have committed a crime. My only ""crime"" has been to fight the corruption, shadow economy and totalitarianism that have been created by this president of Ukraine. Yulia Tymoshenko Prisoner of Conscience and Former Deputy Prime Minister, Ukraine.
In March 2001, Pechersk District Court (Kyiv) found the charges groundless and cancelled the arrest sanction. According to Tymoshenko, the charges were fabricated by Kuchma's regime at the behest of oligarchs threatened by her efforts to eradicate corruption and institute market-based reforms. On 9 April 2003, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling that invalidated and cancelled proceedings on the criminal cases against Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko. Despite Tymoshenko being cleared of the charges, Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for her should she enter Russia. In 2005, all charges were declared groundless and lifted.The criminal case was closed in Ukraine in January 2005 due to lack of evidence, and in Russia in December 2005 by reason of lapse of time. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko and her family. Despite this, the case was reopened in Ukraine since May 2010, after Yanukovych came to power.

Tymoshenko's husband, Oleksandr, spent two years (2002–2004) in hiding in order to avoid incarceration on charges the couple said were unfounded and politically motivated by the former Kuchma administration.On 30 December 2010, the US State Department informed the Ukrainian government of its concern, and indicated that ""the prosecution of Tymoshenko should not be selective or politically motivated.Once the charges were dropped, Tymoshenko reassumed her place among the leaders of the grassroots campaign against President Kuchma for his alleged role in the murder of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze. In this campaign, Tymoshenko first became known as a passionate, revolutionist leader, an example of this being a TV broadcast of her smashing prison windows during one of the rallies. At the time, Tymoshenko wanted to organise a national referendum to impeach President Kuchma.

On 11 August 2001, civilian and military prosecutors in Russia opened a new criminal case against Tymoshenko accusing her of bribery. On 27 December 2005, Russian prosecutors dropped these charges. Russian prosecutors had suspended an arrest warrant when she was appointed prime minister, but reinstated it after she was fired in September 2005. The prosecutors suspended it again when she came to Moscow for questioning on 25 September 2005. Tymoshenko didn't travel to Russia during her first seven months as prime minister (the first Tymoshenko Government).In January 2002, Tymoshenko was involved in a car accident that she survived with minor injuries.


=== Role in the Orange Revolution ===
In the Autumn of 2001, both Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko attempted to create a broad opposition bloc against the incumbent president, Leonid Kuchma, in order to win the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004.In late 2002, Tymoshenko, Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party of Ukraine), Petro Symonenko (Communist Party of Ukraine) and Viktor Yushchenko (Our Ukraine) issued a joint statement concerning ""the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine"". In the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the communist party stepped out of the alliance, but the other parties remained allied and Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance (until July 2006).In March 2004, Tymoshenko announced that leaders of ""Our Ukraine"", BYuT and Socialist Party of Ukraine were working on a coalition agreement concerning joint participation in the presidential campaign. Tymoshenko decided not to run for president and give way to Viktor Yushchenko. On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the Force of the people, a coalition which aimed to stop ""the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine."" The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as prime minister if Yushchenko should win the October 2004 presidential election. Tymoshenko was actively campaigning for Yushchenko, touring and taking part in rallies all over Ukraine. After Viktor Yushchenko had dropped out of the campaign due to his mysterious poisoning, Tymoshenko continued campaigning on his behalf.After the initial vote on 31 October, two candidates – Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko – proceeded to a runoff. As Tymoshenko earlier envisaged, Yushchenko received endorsement from former competitors who didn't make it to the runoff, such as Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party), Anatoliy Kinakh (Party of Industrials and Entrepreneurs), former Kyiv city mayor Oleksanrd Omelchenko and others.
On 6 November 2004, Tymoshenko asked people to spread the orange symbols (orange was the color of Yushchenko's campaign). ""Grab a piece of the cheapest orange cloth, make ribbons and put them everywhere"" she said. ""Don't wait until the campaign managers give those to you"".
When allegations of fraud began to spread, the ""orange team"" decided to conduct a parallel vote tabulation during 21 November 2004 runoff and announce the results immediately to people on Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti) in Kyiv. Tymoshenko called Kyiv residents to gather on the square and asked people from other cities and towns to come and stand for their choice. ""Bring warm clothes, lard and bread, garlic and onions and come to Kyiv"" she said. On 22 November 2004, massive protests broke out in cities across Ukraine: The largest, in Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti, attracted an estimated 500,000 participants. These protests became known as the Orange Revolution. On 23 November 2004, Tymoshenko led the participants of the protest to the President's Administration. On Bankova Street, special riot police prevented the procession from going any further, so people lifted Tymoshenko up and she walked on the police's shields to the Administration building.
On 3 December 2004, the Supreme Court of Ukraine invalidated the results of the runoff and scheduled the re-run for 26 December 2004. After the cancellation of Viktor Yanukovych's official victory and the second round of the election, Viktor Yushchenko was elected president with 51.99% of votes (Yanukovych received 44.2% support).During the protests, Tymoshenko's speeches on the Maidan kept the momentum of the street protests going. Her popularity grew significantly to the point where the media began to refer to her as the Ukrainian or Slavic ""Joan of Arc"" as well as ""Queen of the Orange revolution"" in addition to her pre existing sobriquet from the 1990s decade as the ""Gas Princess"". Additional nicknames included ""Goddess of the Revolution"" and the ""Princess Leia of Ukrainian politics"".


=== First term as prime minister (February – September 2005) ===

On 24 January 2005, Tymoshenko was appointed acting prime minister of Ukraine under Yushchenko's presidency. On 4 February, Tymoshenko's premiership appointment was ratified by the parliament with an overwhelming majority of 373 votes (226 were required for approval). She is the first woman appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine.The Tymoshenko cabinet did not have any other members of party Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc besides Tymoshenko herself and Oleksandr Turchynov, who was appointed the chief of Security Service of Ukraine. The ministers who were working with her took her side in the later confrontation with Viktor Yushchenko.On 28 July 2005, Forbes named Tymoshenko the third most powerful woman in the world, behind only Condoleezza Rice and Wu Yi. However, in the magazine's list published on 1 September 2006, Tymoshenko's name was not among the top 100.In September 2005, Tymoshenko received the ""Person of the Year of Central and Eastern Europe"" award according to the 15th International Economic Forum in Krinitsa Gurska.Several months into her government, internal conflicts within the post‐Revolution coalition began to damage Tymoshenko's administration. On 24 August 2005, Viktor Yushchenko gave an Independence Day speech during which he called Tymoshenko's government ""the best"".Yet on 8 September, after the resignation of several senior officials, including the Head of the Security and Defense Council Petro Poroshenko and Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko, Tymoshenko's government was dismissed by President Viktor Yushchenko during a live television address to the nation. Yushchenko went on to criticize her work as head of the Cabinet, suggesting it had led to an economic slowdown and political conflicts within the ruling coalition. He said that Tymoshenko was serving interests of some businesses, and the government decision to re-privatize the Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant (previously owned by Leonid Kuchma's son in law Viktor Pinchuk) ""was the last drop"" that made him dismiss the government. On 13 September 2005, Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of betrayal of ""Orange Revolution"" ideas. In his interview for the Associated Press, he said that during the time of her presidency at UESU, Tymoshenko accumulated an 8 million Hryvna debt, and that she had used her authority as prime minister to write off that debt. Tymoshenko has repeatedly stated that the mentioned amount was not a debt, but fines imposed by the Tax Inspection from 1997 to 1998, and that all the cases regarding UESU had been closed before she became prime minister.Tymoshenko blamed Yushchenko's closest circle for scheming against her and undermining the activities of her Cabinet. She also criticised Yushchenko, telling the BBC that he had ""practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country"", without rooting out corruption as he pledged to do and that the president's action was absolutely illogical.At the time, Tymoshenko saw a rapid growth of approval ratings, while president Yushchenko's approval ratings went down. This tendency was later proved by the results of parliamentary elections in 2006, when for the first time ever BYuT outran ""Our Ukraine"" party, winning 129 seats vs. 81, respectively. During the previous parliamentary elections of 2002, BYuT had only 22 members of parliament, while ""Our Ukraine"" had 112.The work of Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister in 2005 was complicated due to internal conflicts in the ""orange"" team. According to Tymoshenko, President Yushchenko and Petro Poroshenko were trying to turn the National Security and Defense Council into the ""second Cabinet of Ministers"".Tymoshenko was succeeded as prime minister by Yuriy Yehanurov.


=== Opposition and 2006 parliamentary election ===
Soon after Tymoshenko's discharge in September 2005, the General Prosecutor Office of the Russian Federation dismissed all charges against her. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Tymoshenko and her family.After her dismissal, Tymoshenko started to tour the country in a bid to win the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election as the leader of her Bloc. Tymoshenko soon announced that she wanted to return to the post of prime minister. She managed to form a strong team that started a political fight on two fronts – with Viktor Yanukovych's and Viktor Yushchenko's camps.With the Bloc coming second in the election, and winning 129 seats, many speculated that she might form a coalition with Yushchenko's ""Our Ukraine"" party and the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) to prevent the Party of Regions from gaining power. Tymoshenko again reiterated her stance in regard to becoming prime minister. However, negotiations with ""Our Ukraine"" and SPU faced many difficulties as the various blocs fought over posts and engaged in counter-negotiations with other groups.On 21 June 2006, the Ukrainian media reported that the parties had finally reached a coalition agreement, which appeared to have ended nearly three months of political uncertainty.Tymoshenko's nomination and confirmation as the new prime minister was expected to be straightforward. However, the political intrigue that took place broke the plan. BYuT partners ""Our Ukraine"" and Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) could not come to agreement regarding distribution of powers, thus creation of the Coalition of Democratic Forces was put on hold. Yushchenko and oligarchs from his narrow circle were trying to impede Tymoshenko from returning to the office of prime minister. Her nomination was preconditioned on the election of her long-time rival Petro Poroshenko from ""Our Ukraine"" to the position of speaker of the parliament. Oleksandr Moroz, the chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, also expressed his interest in becoming speaker. Tymoshenko stated that she would vote for any speaker from the coalition. Within a few days of the signing of the coalition agreement, it became clear that the coalition members mistrusted each other, since they considered it a deviation from parliamentary procedures to hold a simultaneous vote on Poroshenko as the speaker and Tymoshenko as prime minister.The Party of Regions announced an ultimatum to the coalition demanding that parliamentary procedures be observed, asking that membership in parliamentary committees be allocated in proportion to seats held by each fraction, and demanding chairmanship in certain Parliamentary committees as well as Governorships in the administrative subdivisions won by the Party of Regions. The Party of Regions complained that the coalition agreement deprived the Party of Regions and the communists of any representation in the executive and leadership in parliamentary committees, while in the local regional councils won by the Party of Regions the coalition parties were locked out of all committees as well.Members from the Party of Regions blocked the parliament from 29 June through 6 July.After lengthy negotiations, SPU suddenly pulled out of the Coalition and joined the alliance with the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Oleksandr Moroz assured that the team of Viktor Yushchenko was conducting secret negotiations with the Party of Regions. According to that deal, Viktor Yanukovych was supposed to become the speaker, while Yuriy Yekhanurov kept the prime minister portfolio. These negotiations were conducted by Yekhanurov himself upon Yushchenko's request. Later, Yekhanurov admitted this fact in his interview with the ""Ukrainska Pravda"" website.Following the surprise nomination of Oleksandr Moroz from the Socialist Party of Ukraine as the Rada speaker and his subsequent election late on 6 July with the support of the Party of Regions, the ""Orange coalition"" collapsed. (Poroshenko had withdrawn his candidacy and had urged Moroz to do the same on 7 July). After the creation of a large coalition of majority composed of the Party of Regions, the Socialist Party of Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine, Yanukovych became prime minister, and the other two parties were left in the wilderness. On 3 August 2006, Tymoshenko refused to sign the ""Universal of National Unity"" declaration initiated by president Yushchenko. The document, signed by Yushchenko, Yanukovych and leaders of Socialist and Communist parties, sealed Yanukovych's appointment as prime minister. Tymoshenko called it ""the act of betrayal"". In September 2006, Tymoshenko announced that her political force would be in opposition to the new government. Our Ukraine stalled until 4 October 2006, when it too joined the opposition.
On 12 January 2007, a BYuT vote in the parliament overrode the president's veto of the ""On the Cabinet of Ministers"" law that was advantageous for the president. (In exchange, BYuT voted for the ""On Imperative Mandate"" and ""On Opposition"" laws). This vote was one of many steps undertaken by BYuT to ruin a fragile alliance between president Yushchenko and prime minister Yanukovych.In March 2007, Yulia Tymoshenko traveled to the United States, where she held high-level meetings with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley, the National Security Advisor under President George W. Bush. On 31 March 2007, Tymoshenko initiated a ""100 thousand people Maidan"" aimed to urge the president to call an early parliamentary election.On 4 April 2007, president Yushchenko issued an edict ""On early termination of duties of the Verkhovna Rada"" as a reaction to violation of the Constitution by the Party of Regions, which had started dragging individual deputies into the ""ruling coalition"" (this being illegal, as coalitions should be formed by factions and not by individual deputies). In doing so, the Party of Regions was trying to achieve a constitutional majority of 300 votes which would enable prime minister Yanukovych to override the president's veto and control the legislative process. Party of Regions didn't obey this edict. In order to dismiss the Verkhovna Rada, Yulia Tymoshenko and her supporters in the parliament (168 deputies from BYuT and ""Our Ukraine"" factions) quit their parliamentary factions on 2 June 2007. That step invalidated the convocation of the Verkhovna Rada and cleared the path to an early election.
An early parliamentary election was held on 30 September 2007.


=== 2007 parliamentary election ===
Following balloting in the 2007 parliamentary elections held on 30 September 2007, Orange Revolution parties had won majority of 229 votes of BYUT fraction (30,71% of the votes (156 seats) and the Our Ukraine/People's Self-defence faction. On 3 October 2007, an almost final tally gave the alliance of Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko a slim lead over the rival party of Prime Minister Yanukovych, thanks in part to a vigorous BYuT campaign in the industrial east, a Party of Regions stronghold. Although Yanukovych, whose party won the single biggest share of the vote, also claimed victory, one of his coalition allies, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, failed to gain enough votes to retain seats in Parliament.On 15 October 2007, the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc agreed to form a majority coalition in the new parliament of the 6th convocation. On 29 November, a coalition was signed between the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, which was associated with President Yushchenko. Both parties are affiliated with the Orange Revolution. On 11 December 2007, the Coalition failed in its attempt to appoint Tymoshenko prime minister, falling one vote short (225 members of parliament supported her nomination). On 12 December 2007, the media reported on the possible attempted assassination of Yulia Tymoshenko. BYuT and Tymoshenko herself said it was an intimidation. On 18 December, Tymoshenko was once again elected as prime minister (supported by 226 deputies, the minimal number needed for passage), heading the second Tymoshenko Government.


=== Second term as prime minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis ===

On 11 July 2008, the Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to Tymoshenko's government in the parliament, but could not collect enough votes.The coalition of Tymoshenko's Bloc (BYuT) and Yushchenko's Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc (OU-PSD) was put at risk due to deliberate misinterpretation of Tymoshenko's opinion on the ongoing 2008 South Ossetia War between Georgia and Russia. Yushchenko's office accused her of taking a softer position in order to gain support from Russia in the upcoming 2010 election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, went as far as to accuse her of 'high treason'.
According to Ukrainska Pravda and Newswire.ca Tymoshenko expressed her solidarity with Georgia on 13 and 14 August, and later preferred to stay neutral on the issue as according to Constitution President Yuschenko headed foreign policy issues.

According to BYuT, Viktor Baloha (Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat) criticized the premier at every turn, doing the dirty job for the President and accusing her of everything from not being religious enough to damaging the economy and plotting to kill him, and the accusation of 'betrayal' over Georgia was simply one of the latest and most pernicious attacks directed at the premier.
After Tymoshenko's BYuT voted alongside the Communist Party of Ukraine and the Party of Regions to pass legislation that would facilitate the procedure of impeachment for future presidents and limit the president's power while increasing the prime minister's powers, President Yushchenko's OU-PSD bloc pulled out of the coalition and Yushchenko promised to veto the legislation and threatened to hold an election if a new coalition was not formed soon. This resulted in the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis, which culminated in Yushchenko calling an early parliamentary election on 8 October 2008.
Tymoshenko was fiercely opposed to the snap election, stating ""No politician would throw Ukraine into snap elections at this important time. But, if Yushchenko and Yanukovych – who are ideologists of snap elections – throw the country into snap elections, then they will bear responsibility for all the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on Ukraine"". Initially, the election was to be held on 7 December 2008, but was later postponed to an unknown date. Tymoshenko had no intention of resigning until a new coalition was formed.In early December 2008, there were negotiations between BYuT and the Party of Regions to form a coalition, but after Volodymyr Lytvyn was elected Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament of Ukraine) on 9 December 2008, he announced the creation of a coalition between his Lytvyn Bloc, BYuT and OU-PSD. After negotiations, the three parties officially signed the coalition agreement on 16 December. It was not known whether this coalition would stop the snap election, although Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn predicted the Verkhovna Rada would work until 2012.On 5 February 2009, Tymoshenko's opponents in the parliament were trying to dismiss her government again, but again the vote failed. The following day, president Yushchenko strongly criticized Tymoshenko and the economic policies of her government. Tymoshenko accused him of spreading ""a mix of untruths, panic and hysteria.""On 18 December 2008, for the first time Tymoshenko accused the National Bank of Ukraine in the conscious manipulation of the hryvnia, and President Yushchenko of colluding with the leadership of the NBU, which led to depreciation of the national currency to the level of ₴8 per US dollar.A large part of Tymoshenko's second term as prime minister coincided in time with the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which required her government to respond to numerous challenges that could have led the country's economic collapse.Tymoshenko's government launched an anti-corruption campaign and identified it as one of its priorities.


=== Gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine (2009) ===
The conditions leading to the 2009 gas dispute were created in 2006, under the Viktor Yushchenko government, when Ukraine started buying Russian gas through an intermediary, Swiss-registered RosUkrEnergo. (Fifty percent of RosUkrEnergo shares were owned by the Russian ""Gazprom"", with 45 percent and 5 percent owned by Ukrainian businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Ivan Fursin, respectively). Some sources indicate that notorious criminal boss Semion Mogilevich (associated with Dmytro Firtash) also owned shares in the company.When Tymoshenko resumed her prime minister duties in 2007, she initiated direct relations between Ukraine and Russia with regard to gas trading. A 2 October 2008 Memorandum signed by Tymoshenko and Vladimir Putin stipulated liquidation of intermediaries in gas deals between the two countries and outlined detailed conditions for future gas contracts. The gas conflict of 2009 broke out because of two factors, the lack of a gas contract for 2009 and a $2.4 billion debt that Ukraine had yet to pay for gas received in 2008. Prime Minister Tymoshenko stated that it was the ""RosUkrEnergo"" company that was responsible for the debt, rather than the state of Ukraine. She called for an end to corruption in the gas trade area and the establishment of direct contracts with the Russian Federation.""RosUkrEnergo"", with the aid of its ties to Yushchenko's administration, managed to disrupt the signing of a gas contract scheduled for 31 December 2008. Oleksiy Miller, head of ""Gazprom"", stated that trader ""RosUkrEnergo"" broke down talks between ""Gazprom"" and ""Naftogaz Ukrainy"": ""Yes indeed, in late December 2008, the prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine came to agreement, and our companies were ready to seal the deal for $235 per 1000 cubic meters of natural gas with the condition that all the export operations from Ukraine will be done bilaterally. RosUkrEnergo then suggested to buy gas at $285 price."" On 31 December 2008, president Viktor Yushchenko gave Oleg Dubyna, head of ""Naftogaz Ukrainy"", a direct order to stop talks, not sign the agreement and recall the delegation from Moscow. The decision made by the president of Ukraine brought on the crisis.On 14 January 2009, Prime Minister Tymoshenko said, ""The negotiations on $235 gas price and $1.7–1.8 transit price, that started on October 2 and successfully have been moving forward since, have been broken up because, unfortunately, Ukrainian politicians were trying to keep ""RosUkrEnergo"" in business as a shadow intermediary... The negotiations between the two prime ministers and later between ""Gazprom"" and ""Naftogaz Ukrainy"" were ruined by those Ukrainian political groups, who have gotten and are planning to get corrupt benefits from ""RosUkrEnergo""."" On 17 January 2009, President of Russia Dmitriy Medvedev said, ""I think that our Ukrainian partners and us can trade gas without any intermediaries, especially without intermediaries with questionable reputation. The problem is that some participants of negotiations insisted on keeping the intermediary referring to the instructions from the top.""On 1 January 2009, at 10 am, ""Gazprom"" completely stopped pumping gas to Ukraine. On 4 January, the Russian monopolist offered to sell Ukraine gas for $450 per 1000 cubic meter (minus a fee for gas transit through Ukraine), which was defined as a standard price for Eastern European countries. On 8 January 2009, the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukraine would have to pay $470 for 1000 cubic meters of natural gas.Between 1 and 18 January, Central and Eastern European countries received significantly less gas. Ukrainian heat-and-power stations were working to utmost capacity. Due to sub-zero temperatures, the entire housing and public utilities sectors were on the verge of collapse. On 14 January, the European Commission and the Czech presidency in the European Union demanded the immediate renewal of gas deliveries in full capacity lest the reputations of Russia and Ukraine as reliable EU partners be seriously damaged. On 18 January 2009, after five-day-long talks, prime ministers Putin and Tymoshenko came to agreement on the renewal of gas delivery to Ukraine and other EU countries. The parties agreed upon the following: A return to direct contract deals between ""Gazprom"" and ""Naftogaz Ukrainy""; the removal of non-transparent intermediaries; the introduction of formula-based pricing for Ukraine (which also works for other Eastern European countries); and a switch to a $2.7 transit fee, which is close to the average price in Europe. According to the new gas contract, in 2009 Ukraine paid an average price of $232.98 per 1000 cubic meters, while other European consumers were paying above $500 per 1000 cubic meters.


=== 2010 presidential election ===

Tymoshenko was a candidate in the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2010, but lost that election to Viktor Yanukovych (Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes in the second and final round of the election, 3% less than her rival).In 2009, the relations between Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko, the Secretariat of the President of Ukraine and the oppositional Party of Regions remained hostile. This company then was owned by Dmitry Firtash – 45%, by Yushchenko family – 27%, and the Russian ""Gazprom"". In 2007, Tymoshenko argued for a direct contract for gas supplies from Russia to Ukraine. In 2008, the two prime ministers signed a Memorandum on the elimination of gas intermediaries. She emphasized early in February 2009 that the ""election struggle for the next presidential elections has virtually begun.""""This is a competition during economic crisis; [some people] prefer to collect political benefits from these problems instead of solving them together"", Tymoshenko said in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in February 2009. Later, in an interview with the French paper Le Monde, the prime minister said that ""the president treats her as a rival striving for president's office."" She also added that the previously mentioned political instability fuels economic crisis. Tymoshenko then called for an early presidential election.
Having long being considered a possible candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2010 election, Tymoshenko announced that she would indeed compete in the upcoming presidential election in a statement broadcast live on national TV on 7 June 2009. Tymoshenko also stated that if she lost the presidential election she would not challenge the results. On 12 September 2009, a tour in support of Tymoshenko's candidacy, called ""With Ukraine in Heart"", began on Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Popular Ukrainian singers and bands took part in the tour.On 24 October 2009, the delegates of all-Ukrainian union ""Batkivshchyna"" formally and unanimously endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko as their candidate for the next Presidential election. The 200 thousand congress took place on Kyiv's Independence Square. On 31 October 2009, the Central Election Commission registered Tymoshenko as a candidate for presidential election in 2010.The Tymoshenko candidacy was also endorsed by prominent Ukrainian politicians such as Borys Tarasyuk, Yuriy Lutsenko, former President Leonid Kravchuk, the Christian Democratic Union, the European Party of Ukraine and others. Putin stated that he was cooperating with Tymoshenko as Prime Minister of Ukraine, but that he was not supporting her in the election.

Tymoshenko's campaign was expected to have cost $100 to $150 million.Tymoshenko expected early parliamentary elections after the 2010 presidential election if Yanukovych won the vote, but she was against this.On 1 December 2009, Tymoshenko urged ""national democratic forces"" to unite around the candidate who garnered the largest number of votes after the first round of the presidential elections. ""If we are not able to strengthen our efforts and unite the whole national-patriotic and democratic camp of Ukraine... we will be much weaker than those who want revenge."" On 5 December 2009, she declared she would go into opposition if she lost the presidential election. She also complained of flaws in the election legislation, and expressed her certainty that attempts were being made by her opponents to carry out vote rigging.
In the first round of the presidential election on 17 January 2010, Tymoshenko took second place with 25% of the vote, and Yanukovych took first place with 35%. The two proceeded to a runoff.On 3 February 2010, two days before the run-off, the deputies from Party of Regions, Communist Party of Ukraine, ""Our Ukraine – People's Self-Defense"" bloc and independent MPs amended the Law on Election of President, which changed the mode of composition and functioning of election commissions. BYuT warned that these amendments would create opportunities for the massive rigging of elections. Tymoshenko called on president Yushchenko to veto the law. Hanne Severinsen, former rapporteur of PACE Monitoring Committee on Ukraine, also called on the president to veto the law. Severinsen's statement read: ""Unfortunately, the Party of Regions, as in 2004, is trying to create conditions for vote fraud.""Despite these requests, President Yushchenko signed the amended Law. This action generated vast international criticism from the Council of Europe and from members of the US congress' Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Committee of Voters of Ukraine stated that the amendments to the Law on Election of President ""contained the biggest threats for democratic mode of the run-off.""Tymoshenko did not receive endorsement from other candidates who had not survived the first round of voting. In the run-off held on 7 February 2010, Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine. According to the Central Election Commission, he received 48.95% of the votes; Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes. Tymoshenko won 17 of 27 constituencies in the western, central and north regions of Ukraine and in Kyiv.Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc members immediately claimed that there was systematic and large-scale vote rigging in the run-off election. However, Tymoshenko herself did not issue a statement about the election until a live televised broadcast on 13 February 2010, in which she said that she would challenge the election result in court. Tymoshenko alleged widespread fraud (according to Tymoshenko, a million votes were invalid) and said Yanukovych was not legitimately elected. ""Whatever happens in future, he will never become the legitimately elected President of Ukraine."" Tymoshenko did not call people into the streets to protest, and stated that she ""won't tolerate civil confrontation.""On 10 February 2010, Yanukovych called on Tymoshenko to abandon her protests and resign as prime minister. Yanukovych stated he wanted to form a new coalition, and may try to call snap parliamentary elections. On 12 February, Yanukovych stated he would not rule out talks with Tymoshenko if she would publicly apologize to him for accusations she made during her election campaign. Tymoshenko's government did not want to resign voluntarily.On 17 February 2010, the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine suspended the results of the election on Tymoshenko's appeal. The court suspended the Central Election Commission of Ukraine ruling that announced that Viktor Yanukovych won the election. Tymoshenko withdrew her appeal on 20 February 2010, after the Higher Administrative Court in Kyiv rejected her petition to scrutinize documents from election districts in Crimea and to question election and law-enforcement officials. According to Tymoshenko, ""It became clear that the court is not out to establish the truth, and, unfortunately, the court is as biased as the Central Election Commission, which includes a political majority from Yanukovych."" Tymoshenko also stated, ""At the very least there was rigging of votes using the main methods of falsification, and I think that for history this lawsuit with all the documentation will remain in the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine, and sooner or later, an honest prosecutor's office and an honest court will assess that Yanukovych wasn't elected President of Ukraine, and that the will of the people had been rigged.""On 22 February 2010, Tymoshenko announced in a televised speech that she believed the presidential election to have been rigged and did not recognize its results. ""As well as millions of Ukrainians, I state: Yanukovych is not our president"", she said. She called on the democratic parliamentary factions to not seek ""political employment"" at the Party of Regions (meaning to avoid negotiations with the Party of Regions regarding the new coalition) and to ""quit arguing and create a united team that would not let an anti-Ukrainian dictatorship usurp the power"".


=== In opposition after 2010 presidential election ===

During a nationally televised address on 22 February, Tymoshenko said of President-elect of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and ""Yanukovych's team"" (she referred to them in the speech as ""The oligarchy""): ""They need cheap labour, poor and disenfranchised people who can be forced to work at their factories for peanuts, they also need Ukraine's riches, which they have been stealing for the last 18 years."" During the speech she also accused outgoing President Viktor Yushchenko of ""opening the door to massive and flagrant election rigging"" days before 7 February runoff of the January 2010 presidential election by amending the election law. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on 24 February, Tymoshenko stated, ""The moment of truth has arrived: The decision whether or not to side with Yanukovych will show who values the preservation of Ukraine's independence and self-identity and who does not."" Tymoshenko and her party, Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko, boycotted the inauguration ceremony of President Yanukovych on 25 February 2010.
If the Second Tymoshenko Government could not be preserved, Tymoshenko stated on 22 February 2010, she would go into Parliamentary opposition. On 3 March 2010, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the second Tymoshenko Government in which the cabinet was dismissed with 243 lawmakers voting in favour out of 450 (including seven lawmakers of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko). (Prime Minister Tymoshenko had demanded this vote herself on 1 March 2010.) On 2 March 2010, the coalition had already lost the parliamentary majority. Before the vote on 3 March, Prime Minister Tymoshenko again stated, ""If the dismissal of the government is passed today, at that very same moment our government will leave the cabinet. Our political force will cross into the opposition."" Tymoshenko blamed the Lytvyn Bloc and ""Our Ukraine, including the leader of Our Ukraine, who announced the position of the faction"" for the fall of the cabinet. Tymoshenko resigned from the prime minister post on 4 March 2010. Fellow BYuT member Oleksandr Turchynov was empowered to fulfill the prime minister's duties until a new government was formed on 4 March 2010. On 9 and 15 March 2010, Tymoshenko called on ""all of the national patriotic forces"" to unite against Yanukovych. On 16 March, a shadow government including BYuT was established. On 10 May 2010, the People's Committee to Protect Ukraine was established, of which Tymoshenko is one of the representatives. Tymoshenko was against the 2010 Ukrainian-Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty, as she believes the agreement harms Ukraine's national interests.On 12 May 2010, Ukraine's prosecutor's office illegally re-opened a 2004 criminal case, which had been closed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine in January 2005 against Tymoshenko regarding accusations that she had tried to bribe Supreme Court judges. As she left the prosecutor's office on 12 May, Tymoshenko told journalists she had been summoned to see investigators again on 17 May, and she linked the move to Russian President Medvedev's visit to Ukraine on 17 and 18 May 2010. Tymoshenko also claimed that she was told by ""all the offices of the Prosecutor General's Office"" that President Yanukovych had personally instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to find any grounds to prosecute her. In a press conference on 12 May, President Yanukovych's representative in the Verkhovna Rada, Yury Miroshnychenko, dismissed Tymoshenko's statement about Yanukovych's personal interest in prosecuting her. ""Yanukovych is against political repression for criticism of the regime,"" Miroshnychenko stated.


=== The most famous criminal cases against Tymoshenko ===
On 15 December 2010, the General Prosecutor's Office instituted a criminal case against Tymoshenko, alleging that she misused funds received by Ukraine within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. She was officially charged on 20 December 2010. Tymoshenko denied the money had been spent on pensions, insisting it was still at the disposal of the environment ministry. She called the investigation against her a witch-hunt. According to government officials, the criminal case against Tymoshenko was a legitimate attempt to uncover corruption by the previous administration. In the case of ""Kyoto money"" American experts ""Covington & Burling"" and ""BDO USA"" stated the following: ""the Documents that we were able to see, clearly point out that the Kyoto Target balance account in the amount of approximately 3.3 billion on the date of receipt remained unchanged throughout the period that is considered, and that, moreover, Kyoto funds have not been touched at all in 2009. Since the balance of this account remained unchanged on the date of receipt, any accusations that Prime Minister Tymoshenko ""used"" these funds contrary to their intended purpose, are obviously false"". On 7 August 2014, the Chairman of the State Treasury service Tatiana Slyuz confirmed that the Tymoshenko government has never spent ""Kyoto money"", the funds were on special accounts and in 2010 were transferred to the Yanukovych government. Tymoshenko was not arrested, but ordered not to leave Kyiv while the inquiry was under way. In the same case, the environment minister in the second Tymoshenko Government, Georgiy Filipchuk, was detained. Filipchuk was the third minister from this government to face criminal charges since its fall in March 2010 (prosecutors charged former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko with abuse of office in early December 2010, and former economy minister Bohdan Danylyshyn was detained in the Czech Republic in October 2010 on similar charges). Lawmakers of BYuT blocked the rostrum and presidium of the Verkhovna Rada the next day in protest against this. That same day, the European People's Party issued a statement in which it ""condemns the growth of aggressive, politically motivated pressure by the Ukrainian authorities on the opposition and its leader Yulia Tymoshenko."" Tymoshenko dismissed the probe as ""terror against the opposition by President Yanukovych."" Earlier that month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka had stated that there were no political reasons for the interrogations of the opposition leaders Tymoshenko, Lutsenko and Oleksandr Turchynov.New corruption charges against Tymoshenko were filed on 27 January 2011. She was accused of using 1,000 medical vehicles for campaigning in the presidential elections of 2010. According to Tymoshenko, the charges were false and part of ""Yanukovych's campaign to silence the opposition."" Subsequently, in 2010, the results of the audit of the accounts chamber revealed that the acquisition of these vehicles was provided for from 2008 in the article 87 of the Budget code, the State budget-2009 and article 13 of the Law of Ukraine ""On state target programs"". In June 2011, the case on the ""Kyoto money"" and of medical assistance vehicles to the village were suspended — after auditing company ""BDO USA"", which has branches in over one hundred countries around the world, and a large law firm ""Covington & Burling"" investigated these cases and stated that they ""are not worth the paper on which they are written.""A third criminal case against Tymoshenko in connection with alleged abuse of power during the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute was opened on 10 April 2011. This case was labelled ""absurd"" by Tymoshenko. On 24 May 2011, prosecutors charged her in connection with this (third criminal) case. She was not arrested.On 26 April 2011, Tymoshenko sued businessman Dmytro Firtash and Swiss-based RosUkrEnergo in a US District Court in Manhattan, accusing them of ""defrauding Ukraine's citizenry by manipulating an arbitration court ruling"" and ""undermining the rule of law in Ukraine"" in connection with a 2010 international arbitration court ruling in Stockholm that ordered Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz to pay RosUkrEnergo 11 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to compensate for fuel it had ""expropriated"" plus 1.1 billion bcm as a penalty.Throughout Yanukovych's presidency, Tymoshenko stayed very critical of his and the Azarov Government's performances and intentions which, among others, she accused of selling out to Russia and of being a ""funeral of democracy."" Tymoshenko has accused ""many of Ukraine's neighbours"" of turning a blind eye to ""Yanukovych's strangulation of Ukraine's democracy, some openly celebrate the supposed 'stability' that his regime has imposed."" She believes ""Ukraine can return to a democratic path of development only with an active civil society and support from the international community.""


=== 2011 trial and imprisonment and other criminal cases against Tymoshenko ===

In May 2010, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's office started a number of criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko which prevented her from normal political activity and from international travel to her allies in the West. The European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Yanukovych government for persecution of Tymoshenko as well as for prosecution in the ""Gas case"" and other cases against her and her ministers. On 24 June 2011, a trial started in the ""gas case"", concerning a contract signed in 2009 with Russian gas company Gazprom to supply natural gas to Ukraine. Tymoshenko was charged with abuse of power and embezzlement, as the court found the deal anti-economic for the country and abusive.Tymoshenko's trial (she was charged in May 2011) for abuse of office concerning a natural gas imports contract signed with Russia in January 2009 started on 24 June 2011 in Kyiv. A number of criminal cases were also opened against former officials from the second Tymoshenko Government. According to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, those cases were indiscriminately made to fight corruption in Ukraine. Former President Viktor Yushchenko testified against Tymoshenko during the trial, which he called ""a normal judicial process."" The trial against Tymoshenko has been referred to as ""selective justice"" and ""political persecution"" in statements by the U.S., Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European countries; in statements by the European Union, NATO, the European People's Party; and in statements by human rights organizations such as Transparency International, Freedom House, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following her conviction, Tymoshenko remained under criminal investigation for ten criminal acts; Ukrainian prosecutors have claimed Tymoshenko committed even more criminal acts.Early in July 2011, the Ukrainian security service (SBU) opened a new criminal investigation into alleged non-delivery of goods by United Energy Systems of Ukraine (in 1996) to Russia for $405.5 million, the SBU maintains that Russia may claim this sum to the State budget of Ukraine (this criminal case was closed in Russia in December 2005 due to lapse of time).On 11 October 2011, the court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of power and sentenced her to seven years in prison, banned her from seeking elected office for her period of imprisonment, and ordered her to pay the state $188 million. She was convicted for exceeding her powers as prime minister by ordering Naftogaz to sign the gas deal with Russia in 2009. Tymoshenko did appeal the sentence, which she compared to Stalin's Great Terror, on 24 October 2011.A 2001 criminal case on state funds embezzlement and tax evasion charges against Tymoshenko was reopened in Ukraine on 24 October 2011. On 4 November 2011, the Ukrainian tax police resumed four criminal cases against Tymoshenko. She was charged for these cases on 10 November 2011. Tymoshenko was re-arrested (while in prison) on 8 December 2011, after a Ukrainian court ordered her indefinite arrest as part of the investigation of alleged tax evasion and theft of government funds (between 1996 and 2000) by United Energy Systems of Ukraine. Again, the European Union showed concern over this.On 23 December 2011, Tymoshenko lost her appeal against her sentence for abuse of power. She and her lawyers had boycotted the appeal proceedings, claiming that the ""judicial system and justice are totally non-existent in Ukraine today."" Tymoshenko lodged a complaint against the verdict at the European Court of Human Rights, which was given priority treatment by the court. On 30 December 2011, Tymoshenko was transferred to the Kachanivska penal colony in Kharkiv.In early January 2012, Tymoshenko's husband Oleksandr Tymoshenko was granted asylum in the Czech Republic, which he had requested at the end of the previous year.In early April 2012, the General Prosecutor's Office began examining the possible involvement of Tymoshenko and former prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko in the murder of Donetsk businessman Olexandr Momot in 1996.A trial concerning alleged misappropriating public funds of United Energy Systems of Ukraine started on 19 April 2012 in Kharkiv. Tymoshenko refused to attend the trial, citing problems with her health. Tymoshenko was then moved against her will from Kachanivska prison to a hospital where she began a hunger strike on 20 April to protest – according to her lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko – ""what is happening in the country and what is happening to her in prison."" She ended the hunger strike on 9 May 2012. Beginning on 9 May 2012, she received treatment at the hospital after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation.The Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the verdict against Tymoshenko on 29 August 2012.From 29 October to 16 November 2012, Tymoshenko was again on a hunger strike to protest vote rigging in the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election.Fatherland United Opposition nominated Tymoshenko as its candidate for the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2015 on 7 December 2012. On 14 June 2013, the congress of her party approved the decision to nominate her as its candidate in the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.On 18 January 2013, Tymoshenko was notified that she was a suspect in the murder of businessman and lawmaker Yevhen Shcherban, his wife and two other people in 1996. In May 2013, the Shcherban murder case was suspended.From 25 November to 6 December 2013 (during the Euromaidan protests), Tymoshenko was again on a hunger strike in protest of ""President Yanukovych's reluctance to sign the DCFTA"" on 6 December.


==== Appeal ====
On 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the ""gas case"". On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case. Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition. After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized. On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing. All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko's presence. Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session. Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log. The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand. At the very end, Tymoshenko's defense boycotted the court session.On 23 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling which fully supported the verdict of the Pechersk court. The judges didn't find any violations during the pre-trial investigation or trial on the ""gas case"", overruling the claims of Tymoshenko's defense.


==== Cassation ====
On 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko's defense submitted a cassation appeal to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the ""gas case"" verdict. On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case. The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision. The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's defense on the ""gas case"" should not be satisfied.Media, diplomats, members of parliament and members of an EU special monitoring mission, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, attended the court sessions. The ruling was announced on the day following public hearing of ""Tymoshenko vs Ukraine"" (regarding unlawful arrest of ex-prime minister and holding her in custody) case at the European Court of Human Rights.The European Union, PACE, and governments of the United States, Great Britain and Canada expressed frustration with the cassation ruling. ""We are deeply disappointed with the consequences of the current situation, when two important opposition leaders cannot stand in the upcoming parliamentary elections, [and] when the court disrespects international standards for fair and transparent processes"", a representative of the European Commission, Michael Mann, said in Brussels on 29 August 2012.


==== International reactions ====
The ""gas case"" trial was viewed by many European and American organizations as a politically charged persecution that violates the law. The European Union and multiple international organizations see the conviction as ""justice being applied selectively under political motivation.""In June 2012, the European Parliament established a special monitoring mission to Ukraine, conducted by former European Parliament President Pat Cox and former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski. Both politicians observed trials, repeatedly visited Tymoshenko in custody and conducted meetings with Ukraine's authorities regarding her release.The European Union shelved the European Union Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the Ukrainian government over the issue.On 30 April 2013, the European Court of Human Rights issued a judgment asserting that ""Ms. Tymoshenko's pre-trial detention had been arbitrary; that the lawfulness of her detention had not been properly reviewed; and, that she had no possibility to seek compensation for her unlawful deprivation of liberty.""
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has adopting a resolution on ""Keeping political and criminal responsibility separate"" in which former prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko is recognized as a political prisoner.The United States Senate passed two resolutions calling for the release from prison of former prime minister Tymoshenko. The most recent, presented in the Senate in June 2013, called for Tymoshenko's release in light of the recent European Court of Human Rights ruling, and was adopted on 18 November 2013. An earlier resolution, passed in 2012, condemned the politically motivated prosecution and imprisonment of former prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko.On 2 October 2013, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution calling for the immediate release of Tymoshenko and, two days later, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, representatives of the European Parliament mission, handed president Yanukovych a petition to pardon Tymoshenko.In December 2012, the united opposition nominated her and later in June 2013 confirmed her as its candidate in the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.


==== Aftermath — Manafort case ====
According to the September 2018 indictment in which Paul Manafort confessed as part of a plea bargain with U.S. special prosecutor Robert Mueller, Manafort and his partner Tony Podesta, brother of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, helped the former Ukrainian President to conduct a media campaign in the West directed against Tymoshenko in order to undermine the support for her by the administration of then U.S. President Barack Obama. In exchange for his testimony against Manafort, Mueller gave Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group complete amnesty, including not prosecuting them for being unregistered agents of a foreign government.The campaign was designed to make Tymoshenko look like a supporter of anti-Semitism. The indictment also states that in July 2011, former U.S. journalist Alan Friedman sent Manafort a confidential six-page document entitled ""Ukraine – the digital road map"", which contained a plan for ""destruction"" of Tymoshenko using video, articles and social networks. The plan included creating a website, posting on the Internet, and sending out e-mails to ""the target audience in Europe and the U.S."" It was also proposed to edit the page of Yulia Tymoshenko in Wikipedia in order to emphasize the ""corruption and legal proceedings"" related to her.


=== 2014 release from prison ===
Following the Revolution of Dignity, on 21 February 2014, Parliament voted for her release in a 310–54 veto-proof vote. To do so, the members of parliament decriminalized the Article on which Tymoshenko was charged and brought it into compliance with Article 19 of the UN Convention against corruption. That could enable immediate release of Tymoshenko through the corresponding court ruling. However, Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after massive violent clashes in Kyiv that killed more than 80 people without signing the bill into law. On 22 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada with 322 votes adopted a decree based on the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and corresponding decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.On the same day, Tymoshenko was released from Central Clinical Hospital No. 5 in Kharkiv, where she had been receiving treatment under police guard since May 2012, after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation.
Her release was praised by western leaders.On 28 February 2014, the parliament rehabilitated Yulia Tymoshenko and restored her rights. That enabled her to run for office; however, she has ruled out becoming prime minister again.Kyivsky District Court of Kharkiv closed the criminal case on financial abuse of the United Energy Systems of Ukraine on 28 February 2014. And, on 14 April, the Supreme Court of Ukraine closed the ""gas case"" against Tymoshenko for ""absence of a criminal act"".On 25 April 2014, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine launched a pre-trial investigation against a number of officials from its own office and the Pechersky district court and Kyiv's court of appeals (the judges who had sentenced Tymoshenko) because of allegedly ""deliberate, systematic and flagrant violation of accused Yulia Tymoshenko's rights to defense, which are granted by Ukraine's current laws"".On 24 June 2014, the Supreme Court of Ukraine rehabilitated Tymoshenko.On 22 January 2015, the European Court of Human Rights announced the termination of consideration of the case of Yulia Tymoshenko v. Ukraine in connection to an implied friendly settlement between the parties, after Tymoshenko's agreement with the government's declaration admitting that the criminal prosecution against her had been politically motivated. The Ukrainian government, in its exchange with the Court, had acknowledged a violation of Tymoshenko's rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights under articles 3 (prohibition of torture), 6 (right to a fair trial), 7 (no punishment without law), 8 (right to respect for private and family life), partly in conjunction with article 13 (right to an effective remedy), article 18 (political motivation), article 10 (freedom of expression) and article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the convention (right not to be tried or punished twice). Taking note of the Ukrainian government's declaration and following measures, as well as of Tymoshenko's agreement with it, the Court struck out the application from its list of cases, as asked by the government, following article 39 of the convention (friendly settlements).On 19 October 2015, the Kominternivskyi district court of Kharkiv has sentenced two former employees of the Kachanivska penal colony No. 54 to three years in prison for inflicting injuries on Tymoshenko.


=== Political activities after release ===
Immediately after her release from prison on 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko travelled to Kyiv, where she attended a makeshift memorial to the first slain protesters on Hrushevskogo Street and gave a speech on Maidan stage. In the following days, she had a number of meetings and phone conversations with USA, EU, and OSCE officials. Tymoshenko addressed the European Union, leaders of western democracies and of countries which guaranteed Ukraine's territorial unity according to the Budapest Memorandum; she called for action to stop what she called the ""Russian aggression"".From 6 to 7 March, Tymoshenko attended a political conference of the European People's Party in Dublin, where she openly discussed events with Angela Merkel, Jose Manuel Barroso, Viviane Reding, Michel Barnier, Mariano Rajoy and Donald Tusk, amongst other notable figures.

=== 2019 presidential election ===
On 20 June 2018, Tymoshenko announced that she would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. She was a heavy favorite in the polls until early 2019. Two weeks before the election, candidate Serhiy Taruta pledged his campaign-team would support Tymoshenko's campaign efforts (however, his name was not taken off the ballot, the deadline to withdraw having been exceeded).
On 8 February 2019, a new presidential candidate was registered with the same surname and initials as Yulia Tymoshenko – the non-factional people's deputy Yury V. Tymoshenko. It was done with the intention that the voters, especially older people, would make a mistake on the ballot. Yulia Tymoshenko herself called it a ""dirty"" move by P. Poroshenko.For a long period before the start of the election campaign, Tymoshenko was the leader of opinion polls. The situation changed after the actor Volodymyr Zelenskyy's New Year's announcement of his intention to run for president, after which it was Zelenskyy who began to gain a rating, beating Tymoshenko at the end of January 2019. Later, during the entire election campaign, Tymoshenko shared 2–3 positions in the rating together with the current President Petro Poroshenko.The first round of the election was held on 31 March 2019.

In December 2019, Tymoshenko united more than 40 political and public organizations that oppose the sale of land in the National Headquarters for the Protection of Native Land.

In early April 2022, Radio Free Europe published further comments by Tymoshenko on the Russian invasion. Reportedly, she stated that ""Vladimir Putin deeply believes that he has a historic mission to recreate the Soviet Union""; that this ambition poses a threat to other Eastern European nations; and that ""Ukraine's membership in NATO is the most powerful guarantee, second only to having a strong army, which can once and for all stop any attempts by the Russian Federation to seize Ukraine.""On 1 March 2022, Tymoshenko took custody of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital.

== Political views ==

Tymoshenko wants her country to become a member state of the European Union (EU), while also expressing concern about antagonizing Russia, saying: ""I try to defend our interests so that we can find a balance in our relations both with the EU and Russia."" Tymoshenko supports Ukraine joining NATO, stating it would be ""uncomfortable"" for Ukraine to remain ""in a void, outside all existing security systems"". According to Tymoshenko, the question of Ukraine joining any system of collective security would ""be resolved only by referendum"". Tymoshenko favours close relations with the EU, including the creation of a free trade area between Ukraine and the EU and later a full EU membership. According to Tymoshenko, ""The European project has not been completed as yet. It has not been completed because there is no full-fledged participation of Ukraine."" She opposes foreign intervention in internal Ukrainian affairs: ""Ukraine's realization of its sovereign rights, forming a modern political nation, cannot be considered as a policy aimed against anyone."" Tymoshenko does not want to expand the lease contract of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Ukraine, saying: ""The Constitution of Ukraine quite clearly stipulates that foreign military bases cannot be deployed in Ukraine, and this constitutional clause is the fundamental basis of the state's security."" She also believes in ""building a genuine civil society"" as the best way to help democracy.Tymoshenko regards Ukraine as a ""unitary and indivisible state"". Tymoshenko considers separatist attitudes in Ukraine unacceptable: ""Love one another, from Donetsk, Crimea, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv and all the other corners of our native land."" According to Tymoshenko, citizens in Russian-speaking Dnipropetrovsk already understood Ukrainian in Soviet times and that problems surrounding the Russian language in Ukraine were ""exaggerated and don't exist"". Tymoshenko opposes the introduction of Russian as a second official state language. On 7 April 2014, she stated she supported the 2012 language law which is aimed at giving Russian and other minority languages (if in a region the percentage of a national minority exceeded 10%) the status of regional language. About her own attitude toward the Ukrainian language, Tymoshenko has stated that ""today I am thinking in Ukrainian... and the fact that I know Russian very well, I think it is not a secret for you... you all know that I was brought up in the Russian speaking region in Dnipropetrovsk, to my mind, I spared no effort to speak Ukrainian as soon as possible as I came in the Government.""Tymoshenko wrote an article called ""Containing Russia"" that was published in the May–June 2007 edition of the journal Foreign Affairs. In the article she criticized Russian expansionism. Consequently, the article irked Russia and more than a week after the article was published, Russia responded by calling it an ""anti-Russian manifesto"" and ""an attempt to once again draw dividing lines in Europe.""The first Tymoshenko Government was in favor of transparent and honest re-privatization of 3,000 enterprises, as with the case of the Kyvorizhstal steel mill. Tymoshenko believes that Ukraine's economy is excessively monopolized. Tymoshenko is against privatization of the gas transportation system in Ukraine. Tymoshenko lists the salvation of the economy of Ukraine during the 2008–09 Ukrainian financial crisis as one of her achievements. The second Tymoshenko Government has spent 1.6 billion hryvnya on modernizing the coal mining industry.Tymoshenko wants to raise the general level of social standards by equalizing salaries in the industrial and social spheres, and pledged in November 2009 to revamp Ukraine's hospitals and health system within two years. She also pledged tax breaks for farmers. Other economic policies included compensation for depositors who lost Soviet-era savings, price controls on food and medicines to bring inflation down, and calls for a review of murky privatizations and high social spending. Tymoshenko wants to cut the number of taxes by a third to simplify the system, and wants to cut the Value Added Tax (VAT) and offer tax breaks to importers of new technologies to poor regions to boost investment there. In December 2009, the second Tymoshenko Government proposed creating independent anti-corruption bureaus in Ukraine.Tymoshenko believes Ukraine can gain energy security and independence, and she wants to speed up exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas from the Black Sea shelf. Considering nuclear power provides almost 50% of the electricity supply in Ukraine, Tymoshenko's government agreed to cooperate with the company Westin to establish factory production of nuclear fuel in Ukraine, independent of Russia. She also suggested a 10-year tax break for enterprises that would develop alternative energy sources in Ukraine.Tymoshenko is for the cancellation of Verkhovna Rada deputies' immunity from prosecution. For Ukraine, Tymoshenko prefers the proportional representation voting system with open lists. Tymoshenko wants to reform the forming of state executive bodies, and favours giving parliamentary opposition ""real instruments of influence on the authorities"". She also wants Ukrainian court system reforms and wants devolution of executive power to local authorities. Together with representatives of regional governments, Tymoshenko expanded a Law that aimed to empower local authorities. In the summer of 2009, she claimed she tried to bring together different political parties in order to amend the constitution and switch to a parliamentary form of government. In February 2011, Tymoshenko stated ""Viktor Yanukovych's naked attempt to hijack the election that precipitated the Orange Revolution should have resulted in him being banned from running in future elections.""In November 2009, Tymoshenko called Ukraine ""an absolutely ungovernable country"" due to the changes to the Constitution of Ukraine as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities (former-President Kuchma) and opposition during the Orange Revolution. Tymoshenko has characterised those reforms as ""incomplete"", and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc voted against them in December 2004. In January 2010, Tymoshenko called for urgent amendments to the Constitution via the majority of the Verkhovna Rada after a survey or plebiscite is conducted. In April 2011, she still believed the constitution ""didn't work"".On 21 May 2016, Tymoshenko expressed hope that the EU will provide Ukraine a visa-free regime. Tymoshenko stressed that the Ukrainian state is there to protect the world all over Europe, continuing to fight the Russian aggression.

== Family and personal life ==

Yulia Tymoshenko's mother, Lyudmila Mykolayivna Telehina (born Nelepova), was born on 11 August 1937 in Dnipropetrovsk. Her father, Volodymyr Abramovych Hrihyan, was born on 3 December 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. His Soviet passport gave his nationality as Latvian. His mother was Maria Yosypivna Hrihyan, born in 1909.Ukrainian media have published speculation regarding the genealogy of Tymoshenko. Some of the hypotheses have no scientific evidence (for example, the hypothesis of the Armenian origin of the surname ""Grigyan"");
 or could be designed to create negative publicity, although her Minister of Communications had in 2005 described her origins as half-Jewish, half-Armenian.About her ethnicity, Yulia Tymoshenko herself has said: ""On my father's side – everyone is Latvian for ten generations, and on my mother's side – everyone is Ukrainian for ten generations."" Tymoshenko's parents were both born in Ukraine and are, therefore, Ukrainian as defined by the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine and by the Ukrainian Constitution.Tymoshenko has said that, like most Soviet citizens, she spoke only Russian in her childhood (although she studied the Ukrainian language and literature at school for ten years, as did all schoolchildren in Soviet Ukraine). In January 2010, Tymoshenko stated that in Dnipropetrovsk she did not have to speak Ukrainian until she was 36 (i.e. before 1996). According to Tymoshenko, her braids are a family tradition.In 1979, Yulia married businessman Oleksandr Tymoshenko (born 11 June 1960). The couple have a daughter – Yevhenia (Eugenia) Tymoshenko (born 20 February 1980) – a graduate of the London School of Economics (Bsc ""Government"", Msc ""Russian and Post-Soviet Studies"").


=== Personal life ===
Tymoshenko and her husband rent a house in Kyiv and own an apartment in Dnipro. Houses in Dnipro belong to their relatives. Tymoshenko has declared she never used and will never use or move into a state-owned summer house, in contrast with all former-Presidents and many high-ranking officials of Ukraine, who live in state-owned dachas in Koncha-Zaspa. According to Ukrainian media, Tymoshenko lives in an estate in Koncha-Zaspa, ""rented from a friend"". In March 2014, Tymoshenko opened the door of her house to public activists and guided them around.In her spare time, before she was imprisoned, Tymoshenko ran on a treadmill for exercise and listened to the music of Andrea Bocelli, Sarah Brightman, Anna Netrebko and Alessandro Safina. Ukrainska Pravda and Лівий берег are her favourite news sources. Tymoshenko stated that she watched the Tunisian Revolution and Egyptian Revolution of 2011 ""with joy and admiration"".On 23 August 2020, Tymoshenko tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized in serious condition, with one of her spokespeople saying that ""her condition is assessed as serious, her temperature is up to 39 (Celsius)."" On 25 August, Tymoshenko was moved to the intensive care unit after her health worsened and prompted a transfer, a spokeswoman said, adding that she remains in ""serious condition."" On 2 September, Tymoshenko announced through her Facebook account that ""Finally today, my crisis condition is behind. And although recovery is still a distant prospect, now there is an opportunity to return to normal life, step by step,"" adding ""that fighting off a serious disease for almost two weeks alters the perception of reality"". On 11 September Tymoshenko's press secretary Maryna Soroka announced that Tymoshenko had tested negative for COVID-19.


== Cultural and political image ==
Tymoshenko is a voluble public performer. Her fiery rhetoric made her an icon of the Orange Revolution.Tymoshenko's critics have suggested that, as an oligarch, she gained her fortune improperly. Her former business partner, former Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko, was convicted in the United States on charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud, the magnitude of which was in the billions of dollars. However, on 7 May 2004, Judge Martin Jenkins of the US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the allegations of Tymoshenko's involvement in Lazarenko's murky business.Her transition from oligarch to reformer was believed by many voters to be both genuine and effective. Discrepancies between her declared income and her luxurious designer outfits, have been pointed out in the Ukrainian tabloids.When Tymoshenko joined the Yushchenko government, she did not speak Ukrainian. According to fellow Ukrainian politician Borys Tarasyuk, in 2002 Tymoshenko ""only spoke Russian even when I spoke to her in Ukrainian"", but since then she has made the transition to speaking only Ukrainian.During her second stint as prime-minister her ratings in opinion polls fell. In early 2008, in opinion polls for the 2009 Ukrainian presidential election, she stood at 30% but by late April 2009 that had shrunk to 15% According to a poll carried out between 29 January and 5 February 2009 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, just over 43% of the Ukrainian voters believed Tymoshenko should leave her post, whereas just over 45% believed she should stay. According to an opinion poll carried out between 3 and 12 February 2009 by the ""Sofia"" Center for Social Studies, some 59.1% of those polled believed that the activities of (then) Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko were aimed at the defense of her own interests and that of her entourage, some 4.2% said her activities were aimed at the defense of interests of foreign states, and some 23.9% believed that Tymoshenko worked for the sake of national interests. 77.7% of the respondents were unsatisfied with the economic policy of the second Tymoshenko Government. Some 71.8% believed that this government was not able to lead the Ukrainian economy out of the 2008–09 Ukrainian financial crisis or even change the situation in Ukraine to better; 18.1% of respondents did think that the government could do that. Despite the neck-to-neck 2010 presidential race, many experts believed that Tymoshenko would win the vote due to her ability to ""hike her popularity just before the voting day"". JP Morgan Securities Inc. experts said that Tymoshenko's victory in presidential election would ""bring stability in 2010, with budget consolidation, better terms of crediting and higher influx of capital. As a result, the economy will have better prospects of growing in the second half of 2010 and 2011"".Tymoshenko has been ranked three times by Forbes magazine among the most powerful women in the world. During her first term in 2005, she was ranked third (behind Condoleezza Rice and Wu Yi), in 2008 she was number 17 and in 2009 at number 47.
According to the Ukrainian magazine Focus, Tymoshenko placed first in an annual ranking of the most influential women in Ukraine in 2006–2010 (five years). During the Orange Revolution, some Western media publications dubbed her the ""Joan of Arc of the Revolution"". In December 2011, Tymoshenko's party BYuT-Batkivschyna nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize.Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin has stated (in November 2009) he found it comfortable to work with his (then) Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko and also praised her for strengthening Ukrainian sovereignty and building stable ties with Moscow and called the second Tymoshenko Government ""efficient and a force for stability"". It has been suggested by Reuters that the Russian government, after seeing her opposition to Viktor Yushchenko, supported her since late 2008, although Putin denied it.Former ally and President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko stated in November 2009, ""I am sure that every week spent by Yulia Tymoshenko in the post of prime minister leads the country to a catastrophe. Because of Yulia Tymoshenko, it is a crisis, a crisis in everything"". Yushchenko has repeatedly accused his former ally turned rival Tymoshenko of acting in the interests of Russia, although she firmly denied the allegations. On 31 May 2010, Yushchenko stated that Tymoshenko was his ""worst mistake"", ""The most serious mistake was to give the power to her twice"". Expert in Ukrainian politics Dr. Taras Kuzio believes that he has always prioritized personal revenge against Tymoshenko over Ukraine's national interests. In her turn, Tymoshenko has blamed President Viktor Yushchenko for obstructing the government-proposed anti-crisis measures and efforts to form a broad coalition to battle the crisis. ""The president is using flashy words today to deprive the nation, first of all its government, of the opportunity to counter the crisis, and to leave the nation without a government it logically needs"" she said. ""Viktor Yushchenko has no right to any criticism. He is the incumbent president. He only has the right to work and to serve Ukraine. He will have the right to criticize when he joins the opposition. Now he must work and answer for his moves"".Former Ukrainian Minister of Finance of Ukraine Viktor Pynzenyk has called Tymoshenko's decisions ""normally guided by 'adventurous populism'"", which she saw as a tool to ""consolidate power in her own hands"" and believed Tymoshenko should have ""taken advantage of the opportunity presented by the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis to reform"".Party of Regions Deputy Head Borys Kolesnykov stated on 11 February 2010, ""Tymoshenko was the most effective politician during the entire period of Ukraine's recent history"". Former European High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana has called Tymoshenko ""a patriot regardless of the position in which you have found yourself"". President Viktor Yanukovych stated about Tymoshenko on 13 May 2010, ""She likes to create a sensation. We have grown used to this extravagant woman"".Vitaly Chepinoha has closely collaborated with Tymoshenko during various elections for more than a decade.In some newspapers and television programs, Tymoshenko has been referred to as Lady Yu (Ледi Ю, Леди Ю).

36,"Tetiana Mykolaivna Chornovol (Ukrainian: Тетяна Миколаївна Чорновол; born 4 June 1979) is a Ukrainian journalist and civic activist, and one of the leaders in the Euromaidan protest campaign. She is known for investigative reports about corruption in Ukraine, as well as for her direct actions. In 2014, she was elected to the Verkhovna Rada.
On 25 December 2013, Chornovol was the victim of a much published and condemned severe beating.From 2014 until 2019 she was a member of the parliamentary faction of the party ""People's Front"", also member of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on national security and defense.

== Biography ==
Tetiana Chornovol was born in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. Her parents come from Cherkasy Oblast in central Ukraine. Currently, she lives in the Kyiv suburb of Hora located in Boryspil Raion.In 2001, she graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the Kyiv International Institute of Linguistics and Law.


== Journalist career ==
Chornovol has been employed by or freelanced for many Ukrainian publications focusing on politics and corruption in Ukraine. She also reported from post-Soviet armed conflicts in which UNA-UNSO volunteers participated.
From 2001 to 2004, she led the ""Theme of the week"" heading in the ""Peak"" magazine.


=== Investigative career ===
In 2004, she began specializing in investigative journalism, contributing to several Ukrainian online newspapers, including Ukrainska Pravda, Livyi Bereh and Obozrevatel. Her focus topics are suspicious personal wealth of Ukrainian politicians, public servants, and businessmen, as well as their involvement in crime.
In 2008, a judgment was obtained from the High Court of Justice in London after Obozrevatel refused to retract false and libelous statements in articles by Chornovol alleging that Rinat Akhmetov was connected to criminal activity and violence. Chornovol had interviewed his former classmates and neighbors, and delved into his early years. Following court pressure, Obozrevatel issued an official apology stating, ""The editorial hereby admits that there was unchecked and false information about Rinat Akhmetov present in the … articles … We hereby give our apologies to Rinat Akhmetov for the problems resulting from the above-mentioned publications."" Chornovol refused to issue an apology or acknowledge any wrongdoing.  Obozrevatel said it was not invited or informed of the date of the court hearing, and claimed that the decisions of British judges are not legitimate in Ukraine.Other articles by Chornovol addressed the alleged organized crime background of then-President Viktor Yanukovych and reported on his lavish countryside property. According to a story in The New York Times, in August 2012 Chornovol ""scaled the walls of Yanukovych's then residential compound, which includes 345 acres of forested hills along the Dnipro River and is called 'Mezhyhirya' after the park where it is situated, and spent nearly three hours wandering the property and taking photographs before being detained by security"". Chornovol was the first investigative journalist researching Mezhyhirya; she started work on the topic in 2006.


=== Recent investigations ===
Immediately before the attack on her, Chornovol made an on-site investigation of the suburban alleged property of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Minister (police chief) Vitaliy Zakharchenko and published a blog report with photos) as well as those allegedly belonging to the country's General Prosecutor Viktor Pshonka. The material was mentioned in her conversations with editors and colleagues.Reacting to Chornovol's 25 December 2013 beating, Ukrainska Pravda and Chornovol's husband announced that they ""suspected each and every person whom Tetiana Chornovol wrote about"" personally, including President Yanukovych, in ""ordering that attack"", until proven otherwise.


== Activism and politics ==
Chornovol comes from a nationalist political background: she joined the Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People's Self-Defence (UNA-UNSO) organization at age 17, and later began her media work there as a press secretary. After UNA-UNSO accepted to negotiate with President Leonid Kuchma during the Ukraine without Kuchma protests, Chornovol considered it to be a betrayal of the organization's principles and left the party. She subsequently engaged in activism.Chornovol openly admits committing various petty crimes in the course of her political acts and investigations, including trespassing and defacing property (such as by spray painting and egg pelting), and encourages other activists to follow her lead in nonviolent resistance way.


=== Long-term activist ===
Chornovol participated in all major patriotic/anti-corruption actions in Ukraine since late 1990s, including Ukraine without Kuchma (2001), the Orange Revolution (2004), the 2011 protests against Russian language use expansion, and Euromaidan protests. During ""Ukraine without Kuchma"" (while still with the UNA-UNSO), she handcuffed herself to the busy rails in the Kyiv Passenger Railway Station with a fellow female protester.In 2011-2013, Chornovol participated in several risky protests against illegal land development, historical architecture destruction, and local government oppression in the city of Kyiv, including the seizure of a tower crane over the Hostynnyi Dvir and occupying a high-rise cornice of the Kyiv City Council assembly hall (both by climbing). While she was climbing the crane, construction workers threw bricks at her but missed. She was removed from the council assembly hall cornice by firemen.In the first week of Euromaidan, Chornovol, protected by bicycle helmet, was present near the van suspected of conducting covert surveillance of protest leaders, and immediately stormed it (by smashing the roof window with a cobblestone and jumping in) in order to prevent destruction of evidence. The automobile turned out to be a communications intelligence vehicle of the Security Service of Ukraine.On 1 December 2013, Chornovol was widely reported smashing windows at Kyiv City Hall in the course of protesters' attempts to seize the building. As she later explained to journalist colleagues, storming and occupying city hall was necessary for warming activists from freezing temperatures (the building was used for this purpose from then on).


=== Unsuccessful election campaign ===
Chornovol unsuccessfully ran in the 2012 parliamentary election in the suburban Lviv Oblast constituency Horodok, representing the oppositional Batkivshchyna party. She came second after non-partisan Yaroslav Dubnevych, who got 47.04% of the votes against Chornovol's 38.88%.


== 25 December attack ==
In the early morning of 25 December 2013 at 01:30 AM Chornovol was severely beaten by a group of men who dragged her from her car near Boryspil International Airport in Boryspil outside Kyiv. The attack provoked massive outcry in Ukraine and around the globe.Chornovol's car was rammed off of the road by a Porsche Cayenne, and two assailants dragged her from her car, beat her, and threw her in a roadside ditch. The attack took place hours after Chernovol published an article on a posh suburban residence which she said was being built for Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaliy Zakharchenko.Chornovol was hospitalized with initial diagnosis of broken nose, concussion, and multiple bruises.


=== Reaction ===
Euromaidan activists called for a picketing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at 8 a.m., which hundreds attended, calling for Zakharchenko's resignation.In her 26 December bed-ridden interview, Chornovol stated that her investigations were the only possible reason for the attack on her, and dismissed suggestions that the attack was a result of either road rage or a false flag political provocation against authorities.The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and U.S. embassy in Ukraine condemned the attack. Opposition parties accused the authorities of being behind the attacks, while a statement from Olena Bondarenko of the Party of Regions categorized the attack as spontaneous violence caused by Euromaidan, and blamed the opposition. According to the (then) governor of Kharkiv Oblast, Mykhailo Dobkin, the attack (that he compared to the Reichstag fire) had been organised by insiders.


=== Investigation ===
The driver of the car that rammed Chornovol off the road was arrested on 25 December 2013, who upon police questioning identified the other two attackers, one of whom was arrested. In total five suspected attackers were detained by the Ukrainian police. According to police investigator Mykola Chynchyn, one of the suspects formerly belonged to a criminal organization led by Viktor Rybalko; and added ""The Klychko brothers allegedly were closely involved in Rybalko's organization"". Chynchyn also stated that opposition lawmaker Mykola Kniazhytskyi, Volodymyr Polochaninov and Davyd Zhvania were connected to a suspect. Serhiy Kotenko (a former co-owner of TVi) is a brother of one of the suspects. Vitaliy Klychko vehemently denied links to the suspects and stated that he would sue Chynchyn for slander, libel and defamation of character.Chornovol's husband characterized the incident as attempted murder, saying ""she was beaten with the intent to kill"", and accused police investigators of downplaying the legal status of the crime. Chornovol believes the attack was ordered by president Viktor Yanukovych for her ongoing investigation into a new luxury mansion and palace he was building.


=== Aftermath ===
 Late on 25 December Chornovol was prepared for a series of reconstructive surgeries on her nose and right eye orbit, and was recovering from severe concussion. By 30 December, Chornovol was transferred out of intensive care but remained in hospital due to severe hypersomnia. On 7 January 2014, she was ready to be discharged from hospital, though still requiring outpatient treatment. However she refused to leave. After the assault, Canadian physician Dr. Richard Hareychuk provided a first hand account of how he raised money for Chornovol through the Ukrainian community in Toronto, arranged for an interview for her on CBC Radio from Ukraine, and traveled to meet her on 17 January 2014.On 21 February 2014, when Euromaidan protesters raided the Mezhyhirya presidential residence of Viktor Yanukovych, Euromaidian activists and investigators from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project discovered ""black lists"" of journalists and activists involved in the oppositions, with an individual dossier on Chornovol, with photographs and the license plate of her car.


== Political career ==
On 5 March 2014, Chornovol was appointed head of Ukrainian government's National Anti-Corruption Committee by the Yatsenyuk Government. She resigned on 18 August 2014. Chornovol said that ""there is no political will in Ukraine to carry out a hard-edged, large-scale war against corruption.""Chornovol became a founding member of the new party People's Front on 10 September 2014, 46 days before the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election. In this election she was elected into parliament as the runner up on the electoral list of People's Front, second to prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.In 2015, she initiated a criminal prosecution of People's Deputy Oleksandr Onyshchenko and the head of the State Fiscal Service Roman Nasirov on behalf of NABU for non-payment of the billions of taxes on gas and oil extraction of firms under the control of Onyshchenko, as well as the illegal restructuring of these debts to Nasirov.
Chornovol started her own investigation of crimes committed by Onyschenko from the visit to his office in Myronivka.During the Verkhovna Rada voting for the cancelling of deputies immunity of Onyshchenko, Chornovol symbolically came in a sweater with horses - Onyshchenko is a famous horse fan.On 22 December 2016, Tetiana Chornovol's bill 5129 was adopted, which destroyed the scheme for obtaining extra profits by alternative energy companies created by the Klyuyev brothers during the Yanukovych government.In 2017, Tetiana Chornovol strongly criticized the blockade of trade with companies located in some districts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. She tried to influence the public opinion, which, in her belief, falsely supported the so-called blockade on blood'. The MP spoke at rallies in Avdiivka, Kramatorsk, and Mariupol.  According to Chornovol, this blockade was initiated by the FSS and it leveled Ukraine's tactical victory in the hybrid war, because, after all, factories and mines located in the occupied territory paid taxes to the budget of Ukraine, as well as supplied raw materials and scarce anthracite for enterprises in Ukraine, but then went under the control of an aggressor state.
In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Chornovol was placed 27 on the party list of European Solidarity. But in the election they won 23 seats on this list, so she did not return to parliament.


== Law on special confiscation ==
As a member of the National Security and Defense Committee, she was focused on budget financing of defense plants for the repair and modernization of armored vehicles, tanks and artillery.Together with the chairman of the committee, Serhiy Pashynskyi, in 2015, to finance the operation of defense factories, initiated a bill on the special confiscation of Yanukovych's assets in the state budget in the form of bonds worth $1.5 billion, arrested in the banks of Ukraine after the Euromaidan. For more than two years Chornovol has been struggling to confiscate these funds, which was only made in May 2017. Chornovol was the author of a number of bills (3025, 4057, 4811, 4890, 5557,) which established the legal mechanism for the confiscation of these funds, and also inherited the laws of many Western European countries regarding the confiscation of unjustified assets.
However, no bill was supported by the Verkhovna Rada. Chornovol stated about the influence of such people from Yanukovych's environment as Andriy Portnov, Serhiy Kurchenko, and Oleksandr Onyshchenko in order to prevent the confiscation of these assets.
In 2016, it even led to the suspension of factories for the repair and modernization of military equipment.In appointing a new General Prosecutor, the group of Oleksandr Turchynov in the People's Front fraction, which member Chornovol is, initiated an agreement to support Yuriy Lutsenko's candidacy in exchange for a ""special confiscation"".Prosecutor General's Office of Yuriy Lutsenko succeeded in May 2017 - $1.5 billion were confiscated into the State Budget of Ukraine as part of the investigation into the actions of the criminal organization of ex-president Yanukovych, with the efforts of prosecutor Kostyantyn Kulyk.However, the fact of the confiscation of Yanukovych's assets was harshly criticized by a number of public anti-corruption organizations in Ukraine. Chornovol said that this was due to the fact that lawyers, who at the time of Yanukovych legally accompanied the government's corruption schemes (in particular, the schemes of Kurchenko), after the Maidan began to work in public anticorruption organizations. This caused Chornovol to initiate known amendments to the Law No. 6172 ""On Prevention of Corruption"", which obliged public officials of public anticorruption organizations to submit e-declarations.


== Participation in the war against Russia ==
In 2014, Tetiana Chornovol took part in the defense of Mariupol as part of the ""Azov"" battalion.From February 24, 2022, Chornovol is fighting on the front lines as part of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade named after the Black Zaporozhians.

Launching her career following the Rose Revolution of 2003, Dekanoidze first served as an official within the Ministry of Internal Affairs and as a diplomat, before being appointed as head of the Police Academy to oversee law enforcement recruitment reforms. In 2012, she became head of the National Examination Center and Minister of Education and Science in the last months of the Saakashvili presidency. Following UNM's loss in the 2012 parliamentary elections, she joined the opposition, before moving to Ukraine in 2015, where she was appointed as Chief of the National Police under during the presidency of Petro Poroshenko.
Returning to Georgia in 2016, she was elected to Parliament in 2020 and joined the legislature in May 2021 after a boycott in the midst of a political crisis.

In a row with her party, she left the United National Movement on March 24, 2023.


== Personal life ==
Khatia Dekanoidze was born on January 20, 1977, in Tbilisi, at the time the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. She studied international relations and diplomacy and received her bachelor's degree from Tbilisi State University in 1999. In parallel, she also received training from the Central European University in Vienna, as well as the US-based RAND Corporation.

During a speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, she would state: As a young girl, I used to be a part of different sports games and groups. I remember that embarrassing feeling after the staring looks of some older males. I was not feeling comfortable, and I am sure that this is a moment for lots of young girls, how while they are playing basketball, soccer, tennis or wrestling at the arena, it might be their passion but they must concentrate on their security rather than sport.


== Biography ==


=== Joining the Saakashvili administration ===
Khatia Dekanoidze joined the public service following the Rose Revolution of 2003 that brought to power the young pro-Western government of Mikheil Saakashvili. Fresh of a training from the US intelligence-linked RAND Corporation, she was named Head of Administration of the Ministry of State Security of Georgia under the leadership of Irakli Okruashvili, which eventually became the Ministry of Internal Affairs under the powerful Vano Merabishvili. Holding the position from 2004 to 2005, she oversaw some of the most well-known reforms of the agency, which culminated with the mass firing of thousands of police officers in an attempt to purge law enforcement from corruption. This time also coincided with a rise in tensions between the central government and the secessionist authorities of South Ossetia, with the MIA playing a major role in the developments.
She briefly joined the diplomatic sector, working at the Georgian Embassy in Washington, DC from 2005 to 2007.In May 2007, she was appointed rector of the newly created Police Academy of Georgia. Her appointment was meant to enact reforms into the law enforcement recruitment procedures. In 2022, Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili would accuse Dekanoidze of playing a large role in the controversial treatment of prisoners, which included alleged human rights abuses and potential torture, even though his statement has not been corroborated by other sources, including investigations launched after Saakashvili's defeat She held the post until May 2012. and has been considered as an attack based on her role as opposition leader.


=== Minister of Education ===
On May 30, 2012, Khatia Dekanoidze was appointed as Director of the National Examination Center of the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia, an office in charge of overseeing university entrance exams and teacher certifications. She was appointed to replace Maia Miminoshvili, whose dismissal after her son attended an opposition campaign rally caused a large controversy during the 2012 parliamentary election. She had to face the protest resignation of 70 staff members upon her taking office, while ensuring the proper holding of the national exams set within weeks of her appointment.
On June 28, seventeen examination centers were opened for 47,500 students and 40,000 teachers. These exams were planned to be the last single, standardized testing in Georgia's education system, as the NEC was planning to launch a reform for 2013 and introduce an ""8+1 system"", featuring eight high school graduation exams and one general knowledge paper for graduating students. Critics like Miminoshvili claimed that dropping the standardized testing system would risk lowering the quality of students entering universities.On July 4, after just one month in charge of the NEC, she was appointed to lead the Ministry of Education and Science in the new cabinet of Prime Minister Vano Merabishvili, replacing Dimitri Shashkini. Her appointment was meant to symbolize the new high priority status of education reform for the Saakashvili government, as Dekanoidze at the time benefited from high approval ratings due to her past as a lead police reformer. However, her term ended in October when the United National Movement lost the parliamentary election and the new Georgian Dream government replaced her with philosopher Giorgi Margvelashvili.

After the Saakashvili-led UNM became an opposition party, Khatia Dekanoidze distanced herself from national politics, working briefly for the Center for European Policy Analysis and an adviser to the U.S. Department of Justice's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program. Between 2013 and 2014, she served as Dean of the private Caucasus University in Tbilisi. During the 2014 local elections, she was UNM's nominee for Mayor of the Qvareli Municipality, where she was defeated in a runoff against GD's Ilia Mzekalashvili with only 20% of the vote.Following the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and Petro Poroshenko's election as President of Ukraine, she became one of Saakashvili's close protégées to join him as he took a leadership role in the new pro-Western government of Kyiv. In 2015, she was granted the Ukrainian citizenship just as Saakashvili was appointed Governor of the Odesa Oblast, formally at the request of Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov, in whose cabinet she first served as an adviser. On November 4, 2015, she was appointed by President Poroshenko as the first Chief of the National Police of Ukraine, a position newly created as part of MIA reforms. She took over Ukrainian law enforcement at a time when it had small public approval, crime was sharply rising, most police officers were without full equipment, and corruption remained strongly entrenched. In March 2016, she dismissed the head of the local police division of Vinnytsia after it was discovered he had been backing separatism in Eastern Ukraine. According to later reports by some Ukrainian media outlets, Oleksandr Tereschuk, the dismissed head of the police division of Kyiv, planned large-scale protests by police officers against her.Dekanoidze's main task was to reform the corrupt and inefficient law enforcement agency. Within four months, she had replaced 80% of senior management in Kyiv and up to 60% of regional police leaders by requiring a recertification training that most top brass failed. She appointed mainly new faces to replace them, like Andriy Kryshchenko (known for his role in the battle for Horlivka during the 2014 pro-Russian offensive in the Donbas) as head of the Police of Kyiv, and former Georgian MIA official Giorgi Lortkipanidze as head of the Police of Odesa. She launched an entirely new patrol police in 29 cities in the first half of 2016, a mobile police car program in Kyiv, a River Police Patrol on the Kyiv section of the Dnieper river, and enhanced patrol units in the capital in October 2016. She also launched a pilot program to send traffic violations to people instead of only relying on police stops. In July 2016, she declared having launched a war on crime and another one on corruption and through a new vetting process, fired more than 5,600 law enforcement officers (or about 6% of the total police force). During her term, public polls showed improvements in public trust towards the police.In June 2016, the first-ever Kyiv Pride parade took place despite threats by far-right organizations, as Dekanoidze deployed 7,000 police officers and led the operation that arrested 50 radicals during the parade. In July, she also led efforts to protect a controversial Orthodox religious procession, even installing metal detectors along the path of the procession. When police officers beat a man to death in Kryve Ozero, she personally spearheaded the investigation into the murder and disbanded the local police station entirely.Well-known Belarusian journalist Pavel Sheremet was murdered in a car explosion on July 20, 2016. Leading the investigation, Dekanoidze negotiated for the FBI's involvement in the investigation, while the National Police classified documents related to the case for national security purposes. She called him a personal friend and helped set up a special inter-agency group between the National Police and the SBU to investigate his death. Details surrounding the death of the journalist remain unknown to this day and some evidence point to the involvement of Belarusian intelligence.

As the rift between Saakashvili and Poroshenko became obvious, so was Dekanoidze's relationship with the Ukrainian government. In a September 2016 report to the Verkhovna Rada, she called on increased funding as police officers lacked uniforms and equipment. Days after Saakashvili's resignation as Governor of Odesa, she resigned on November 14 and was formally dismissed by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine two days later. In her departure, she complained that her powers were insufficient to make significant changes and that pressure from government officials and MPs was too great. Her deputy Vadym Troyan was appointed Acting Chief, while she stated that reforms ended with her departure.She soon returned to Georgia and had her citizenship reinstated in May 2017.


=== In Georgia's opposition ===


==== 2020 Parliamentary elections ====
Back in Georgia, she joined the non-governmental and academic sector, working as an OSCE expert on police reform from 2017 to 2018, a Marshall Security Center fellow between 2017 and 2019, and an expert for the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs from 2018 to 2019. Politically, she remained aligned with UNM, becoming one of its largest donors. In March 2017, her son was arrested for alleged drug use, an arrest she dubbed ""politically-motivated"", as it happened during other high-profile, opposition-related drug arrests.On August 26, 2020, Khatia Dekanoidze was nominated by UNM as its nominee for the Parliamentary Majoritarian District of Isani in Tbilisi, a nomination that led to controversy within the Georgian opposition as the latter had previously agreed on Giorgi Vashadze of the Strategy Aghmashenebeli party as a joint opposition candidate two months prior. At the time, 30 opposition parties, including UNM, had signed an agreement on fielding joint candidates for the 2020 parliamentary elections and Vashadze accused her and her party of violating that agreement. Like the rest of her party, she backed Mikheil Saakashvili as the party's prime ministerial candidate (despite his pending legal cases in Georgia and his exile from the country) and was expected to be appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs in case of an opposition victory.During the campaign, she accused the State Security Service (SSS) of placing her office under surveillance, while alleging significant voter fraud on Election Day, including ballots disappearing from the 81st Precinct of Isani. In the first round of October 31, she ran against several large names, like incumbent MP Davit Chichinadze (Tribuna party) and ended up second with 27.2% of the vote, moving to a runoff against Georgian Dream's Kakha Kakhishvili. Like the rest of the opposition nominees who secured a place in the runoffs, she refused to recognize the results of the elections and boycotted the runoffs, eventually receiving only 7.3%. Listed in fourth position on UNM's electoral list, she was nonetheless elected to Parliament through the proportional system.


==== Boycott and 19 April Agreement ====
Refusing to recognize the results of the 2020 parliamentary elections, Khatia Dekanoidze was one of the opposition figures that led a series of protests that lasted until spring 2021. This refusal by some opposition parties to take their seats in Parliament led Georgian Dream to propose a bill that would strip these parties of public funding, a bill that was criticized by the European Union. While in favor of ending public protests following the resignation of PM Giorgi Gakharia in favor of internationally mediated negotiations, the follow-up controversial arrest of UNM leader Nika Melia under the orders of Gakharia's successor Irakli Gharibashvili made her lead the party's protest planning strategy, unveiling a schedule of demonstrations for weeks to come during a public speech on Rustaveli Avenue. Public statements at the time also reveal a clash between Dekanoidze and then-party chairman Grigol Vashadze when the latter called for an end to street protests and direct negotiations with the government.Following the launch of EU-mediated negotiations between Georgian Dream and the opposition in March 2021, she opposed the release of Nika Melia through bail or an amnesty mechanism, arguing that these would be a recognition of crimes that she called politically motivated. When the talks held under the mediation of EU envoy Christian Danielsson failed, she called for the United States to replace the EU in the mediation.UNM refused to join other opposition parties in their signing of the ""19 April Agreement"", negotiated by EU Council President Charles Michel and which ended the political crisis that had plagued Georgia since the parliamentary elections. While she was not publicly in favor of the agreement, she favored an end to the parliamentary boycott after the agreement was reached as a sign of good faith towards Western negotiators. Khatia Dekanoidze formally rejoined Parliament on 28 May 2021 and was elected as Chairwoman of the Parliamentary Faction of the ""Strength is in Unity"" opposition bloc (made of several parties under the leadership of UNM)


==== UNM Faction Chair ====
In addition to her chairwomanship of the parliamentary opposition faction, Khatia Dekanoidze has also served as a member of the Georgian Parliamentary Delegation to PACE and of the Georgia-Moldova-Ukraine Parliamentary Assembly, as well as a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with 40 countries. In PACE, she caucuses with the right-wing European People's Party and was one of the signatories of a November 2022 declaration in support of protests against the Iranian regime. On October 13, 2022, she successfully sponsored an amendment to a PACE resolution designating Russia as a terrorist state to include a call for the release of Mikheil Saakashvili as a political prisoner of Russia.Despite having agreed to end the boycott, Dekanoidze led a second partial boycott of parliamentary work after Georgian Dream confirmed the appointment of several controversial Supreme Court justices, in violation of the 19 April Agreement, announcing her faction would only participate in motions of no confidence and in constitutional amendment votes. She also opposed President Salome Zourabichvili's appointment of Giorgi Kalandarishvili as Chairman of the Central Elections Commission. Following the violent July 5 anti-LGBTQ, far-right protests that injured dozens of journalists, she accused extremist organizations of working secretly with the authorities and was one of seven female MPs to take over the Speaker's chair in a call for the government to resign.Dekanoidze was UNM's nominee for Mayor of Kutaisi during the October 2021 local elections. Receiving the support of other opposition groups, she was endorsed by the libertarian European Georgia and Girchi-More Freedom parties to run against GD's Iosebi Khakhelashvili, while former Speaker Nino Burjanadze, and Lelo's Badri Japaridze also endorsed her during her runoff. In the midst of her campaign, she presented a shadow cabinet that would take office in case of her victory, with four vice-mayors representing different parts of the opposition: Ana Natsvlishvili (Lelo), Imeda Kldiashvili (G-FM), Revaz Chomakhidze and Temur Tsamtsishvili (independent), while pledging to allow civil society organizations to select the head of Kutaisi's Audit Service. She lost the runoff after receiving 48.4% of the vote, although she contested the results, calling for a recount due to the higher amount of annulled ballots than difference between both candidates' results. She alleged several other violations, including the use of administrative resources, the forceful use of public employees in campaign activities, and voter bribery by Deputy Infrastructure Minister Koba Gabunia. On Election Day, she considered the shutdown of electricity at a vote-counting facility and the pre-closure submission of results by the 124th precinct to be evidence of voter fraud. In a following scandal, a member of an oversight precinct commission later alleged that GD representatives pressured her to allow unregistered citizens to vote in polls not meant for them. Dekanoidze alleged pressure by the SSG on that individual and her family, while Imeda Kldiashvili was arrested for parking his car in front of the SSS building in Kutaisi in protest.An early supporter of Mikheil Saakashvili's return to Georgia despite legal proceedings filed against him, she has called charges against him false and politically motivated. While she maintains she was not aware he would secretly come to Georgia on the eve of the 2021 local elections, she has accused the authorities of inhuman treatment and torture against the former Georgian president. She was a supporter of his transfer to a private clinic following his hunger strike in a Georgian prison, even meeting with Speaker Kakha Kuchava to negotiate a temporary pause in street protests in exchange for Saakashvili's transfer, although that request was denied and Saakashvili was transferred instead to a controversial detention facility in Gldani. During one of her visits in prison, she was shouted at by other inmates, which Saakashvili called a form of ""psychological abuse."" Dekanoidze has refused to entertain the idea of negotiating Saakashvili's release for his departure from politics.On December 21, 2021, she met with President Zourabichvili to ask for the release of Saakashvili, although the former has refused to pardon him. On January 31, 2022, she announced an end of her faction's partial boycott and a plan to set-up a special parliamentary investigative commission to look into alleged inhuman treatment of Saakashvili in prison. The end of the boycott was a contentious issue within UNM and was decided after a vote of its Political Council, with Dekanoidze favoring returning to full parliamentary work. However, the parliamentary vote to terminate the mandates of three opposition MPs (Elene Khoshtaria, Badri Japaridze and Shalva Natelashvili) days later derailed plans for an investigative commission, which needed 50 votes to be established. She voted against the GD-sponsored so-called ""Deoligarchization Bill"", a proposed law that would create restrictions on the political participation of wealthy individuals qualified as oligarchs, arguing that the bill was meant to target the opposition and purposely ignored the role of Bidzina Ivanishvili.During his 2022 annual report to Parliament, Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili called her ""sick and in need of medicine"".


==== Independent MP ====
On January 31, 2023, Khatia Dekanoidze announced her resignation from the faction chairpersonship after UNM's new leader Levan Khabeishvili suggested the party would resign its parliamentary seats in exchange for the Georgian authorities to let imprisoned former President Saakashvili be transferred abroad for medical treatment. She called Khabeishvili's statement populist and affirmed she had not been consulted on the issue. As an MP, she has opposed the parliamentary boycott that the SIU faction declared in February 2023, while becoming a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.
On March 24, 2023, following weeks of disagreement over the boycott, she announced her departure from the United National Movement, remaining on as an independent MP.


== Political Positions ==


=== 2019 demonstrations and law enforcement ===

Khatia Dekanoidze was a strong proponent of the 2019 political protests that followed the so-called ""Gavrilov Night"" - the series of events on June 20, 2019, that started with the sitting of Russian Duma MP Sergey Gavrilov at the Georgian parliamentary speaker's chair and culminated with the violent police dispersal of ensuing anti-Russian protests, - protests that called for the resignation of the government. Nika Melia, a leading UNM activist who led a push that same night by protesters to take over the parliament building, became the target of an investigation aiming at his arrest and when Parliament lifted his deputy immunity, she claimed that the institution had ""lost its legitimacy"" and was ""formalizing dictatorship"". Melia's arrest in connection with these events in February 2021 led Dekanoidze to accuse the Gharibashvili government of ""deciding to turn into a Bolshevik regime"". She remained pessimistic about former PM Giorgi Gakharia's creation of an opposition party as he served as Minister of Internal Affairs during the events of Gavrilov Night.A well-known activist for police reform both in Georgia and Ukraine, she has called for the abolition of ""repressive systems"" like the State Security Service and the State Prosecutor's Office, instead supporting the election of sheriffs at the local level. She has often been critical of police brutality, notably calling for the arrest of police officers involved in the physical assault against a disabled minor in 2021. She's also been critical of the government's alleged use of organized crime groups to put an end to clashes between ethnic Georgian and Azeri communities in Dmanisi.A massive leak of SSS documents in September 2021 revealed that one of her phone conversations with a foreign diplomat had been wiretapped. Another leak in September 2022 showed that Khatia Dekanoidze has been under close personal and work surveillance, surveillance that has taken place in undercover tailings and electronic formats.


=== COVID-19 regulations ===
Khatia Dekanoidze has both been opposed to strict regulations meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 and in favor of stronger vaccination campaigns. After the Georgian government decided in January 2021 to extend for another two months strict public regulations, including a nationwide curfew, a ban on public transport, and the closure of winter resorts, she took part in a public protest calling for the removal of all restrictions.She has also criticized Prime Minister Gharibashvili for his perceived anti-vaccination sentiments after making statements on the inefficiency of some vaccines.


=== War in Ukraine ===
A former official in Ukraine, Khatia Dekanoidze has been a supporter of Ukraine's territorial integrity and national sovereignty for years before the 2022 Russian invasion. Already in early 2019, she criticized the Georgian government's silence on the autocephaly proclamation by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, declaring that ""this issue concerns our struggle for freedom against a common enemy"". In the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion, she had called on the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs to provide MPs with briefings on the tensions, although they refused. She visited Kyiv with members of the opposition parties Lelo and Droa on February 2 in a sign of solidarity.On the day of Russia's invasion (February 24, 2022), she was one of the co-sponsors of a proposal signed by President Zourabichvili to hold an emergency parliamentary session, although this was vetoed by Georgian Dream. A speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Georgian Parliament secured by Dekanoidze was also blocked. In April, she refused to have her faction represented in the parliamentary delegation visiting Ukraine along with GD. She has accused the Georgian government of secretly cooperating with Russia through its ties to Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Russia-affiliated oligarch and founder of GD, and has criticized statements by Prime Minister Gharibashvili against sanctions on Russia. In September 2022, she consulted with Ukrainian authorities to help them draft a list of Georgians to be sanctioned by Kyiv. In response to the government's calls for a ""pragmatic foreign policy"" towards the war, she has stated: ""There is no peace in slavery"". Several Georgian Dream officials have accused her of working to spread fake news about Georgia in Ukraine.As an MP, she has called for the criminalization of the Z symbol as hate speech since the discovery of the Bucha massacre and has called the Russian invasion ""a madman's desire to destroy an independent country."" Calling on the West to increase sanctions on Russia, she was one of the signatories of a PACE resolution calling for a full and immediate ban of Russian oil and gas by European countries. She co-sponsored a resolution that removed the credentials of the Russian delegation from PACE.


=== Economic policy ===
Khatia Dekanoidze is a proponent of economic policies meant to encourage foreign investments into Georgia. As such, she has criticized litigation against tobacco company Philip Morris and the perceived lack of judicial independence as deterrents against future foreign investments.
Following the death of a worker in a coal mine explosion in Tkibuli on January 30, 2022, she vowed to address labor safety regulations in Parliament.


=== Abkhazia and South Ossetia ===
Khatia Dekanoidze is opposed to any direct negotiations with the separatist governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, arguing that talks would only benefit Russia's interests. This has been in contrast with former Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili's call for direct dialogue with the separatist authorities. In 2020, she was against a potential visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Georgia in the framework of Georgia's presidency of the Council of Europe.

From 1991 she worked in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea's Administration of the pension fund until 1998.


=== Political career ===
In 1998 Denisova became the Minister of Economy and Finances in the Crimean government. In Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea, she served as Minister of Economy, Minister of Finance and head of the Treasury Department. Denisova was named Politician of the Year in 2001. In 2000, Denisova was detained for 24 hours and charged with power abuse. Denisova has stated she was persecuted for refusing to sign a budget document. This criminal case was soon closed.Denisova was a member of Batkivshchyna (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) from 2005 to 2014. During the 2006 and 2007, parliamentary elections, she was elected as a deputy to the Verkhovna Rada.


==== Minister ====
On 18 December 2007, Yulia Tymoshenko, with a margin of two votes, was elected Prime Minister, and the second Tymoshenko Government was formed between the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc in which Denisova was elected Minister of Labour and Social Policy.
In October 2009, Denisova was ranked 15th in the top 100 of ""most influential women in Ukraine"" compiled by experts for the Ukrainian magazine Focus (six places lower than non-minister and fellow Batkivshchyna member Natalia Korolevska).


==== 2010 Crimean parliamentary election ====

==== Ombudsman for Human Rights in Ukraine ====
On 15 March 2018, the Verkhovna Rada appointed Denisova Ombudsman to head the Ukrainian Commission for Human Rights, where she led a team of human rights and constitutional lawyers.In February 2019, following the Kerch Strait incident in which Russia and Ukraine's tensions had dramatically increased and the Federal Security Service had taken into custody a number of Ukrainian troops, Denisova was able to make contact with Tatyana Moskalkova, her Russian counterpart, via an impromptu meeting, and discuss the status of wounded Ukrainian prisoners of war. The latter had previously refused to meet with her after Denisova launched an official protest that she was not able to visit the Ukrainian wounded soldiers directly.During the Russian invasion she was described as becoming ""one of the leading voices of Ukraine’s suffering and outrage, appearing frequently in news coverage and producing a copious stream of social media posts"" She set up a hotline for citizens to report human rights violations and requests for help. According to New York Times, ""The vast majority [of calls], more than 15,000 in the first six weeks of war, were for missing people, but requests also come in for humanitarian aid and safe corridors out of besieged cities... The information from callers is fed into a database that Ms. Denisova shares with government officials and prosecutors. As such, it has become an invaluable first warning system for the gross human rights abuses occurring in the cities under assault, and in the towns and villages occupied by Russian troops."" Denisova argued that Russian forces were committing genocide, citing the systematic sexual violence by Russian troops and the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. She said that in many cases Russian soldiers had called Ukrainian women ""Nazi whores"" and raped them “until they can't give birth, or give birth to their children""  ""This suggests that they want to destroy the Ukrainian nation. And when they kill children, it also means that they do not want our nation to be in this world.”On 31 May 2022, the Verkhovna Rada voted to dismiss her, using the provisions of Ukraine's Martial law, for failing to facilitate humanitarian corridors in warzones, to prevent Ukrainians under Russian occupation from being deported to Russia, and to facilitate the protection and exchange of prisoners of war. The deputy chairman of the Rada regulatory committee said that Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk had had to take on most of the wartime human rights issues. An open letter from 140 activists, media professionals and lawyers criticized the rhetoric of her reports about sexual crimes by Russian forces just before her dismissal.Some NGOs and human rights activists, including Opora, questioned the legality of her removal. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) and the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) both criticised the procedure followed for dismissing Denisova, with HRMMU describing the dismissal as ""violat[ing] international standards"". As of 3 June 2022, a replacement had not been appointed. In June, Ukrainska Pravda published a report alleging that journalists and the Ukrainian Prosecutor’s Office had only been able to verify some of the rapes Denisova had spoken about publicly. Additionally, the deputy chairman of Ukraine's parliament regulatory committee Pavlo Frolov, said that Denisova's focus on reporting some unverified crimes had harmed Ukraine's reputation and distracted media attention from proven crimes and problems.

89,"Iryna Romanivna Mudra (Ukrainian: Ірина Романівна Мудра, romanized: Iryna Romanivna Mudra; born 26 July 1975) is a Ukrainian lawyer and banker who has been serving as one of the several Deputy Ministers of Justice under Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal since 27 May 2022. A graduate of the University of Lviv, she was a lawyer at the State Savings Bank of Ukraine before she began working for the state.
In the international arena, she is known for publicly promoting the development of a mechanism for sanctions and reparations against the Russian Federation for the war against Ukraine.


== Biography ==
Iryna Mudra was born on July 26, 1975, in Drohobych, Lviv region.In 1998 she graduated from Ivan Franko Pedagogical Institute at the Faculty of Foreign Languages with honors. Then, from 2002 to 2006 she studied on Faculty of Law of Ivan Franko Lviv National University. In 2017 Mudra completed a particular course for lawyers in Legal English at the University of Cambridge, in 2017—2018 she completed an MBA course at the Kyiv School of Economics. From 2019 to 2020, she completed an internship at the International Compliance Association (London) and received a certificate in Corporate Management, Risks and Compliance.
In 2006–2008 Mudra worked as a head of the department of credit and investment activities of the legal department of Transbank, in 2008–2013 she worked in Swedbank. From 2013 to 2015, she served as head of the legal department of risk management of Pravex Bank, and from 2015 to 2022 — as a head of the legal team of the State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oschadbank).


== Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine ==
On May 20, 2022, by Order No. 394 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, Iryna Mudra was appointed Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine.
The cash crunch has concentrated Ukrainian officials’ gaze on Russia's sanctioned oligarchs. The government has been working the diplomatic channels since the beginning of June to build political momentum for an accord to make the Russians pay, Deputy Minister of Justice Iryna Mudra 5 July said in an interview from Kyiv. ""Of course, we are very thankful to our allies for stepping up with financial help,"" she said. ""But we do have to admit that it should be the Russians who should pay for all these damages."" However, there's no readymade legal structure that would allow for seizing frozen Russian assets and sending them to Ukraine, she said, especially since Russia could veto anything at the U.N. level from its perch on the Security Council. So instead, the Ukrainian government is aiming to get, at the very least, the global community's “blessing” at the U.N. General Assembly in September, Mudra said. In addition to Russian assets, Kyiv would also like to see a special tax on transactions with Russia.July 7, she stated that the project to digitize the justice system had been postponed for several years. But now, it's time to move as fast as possible, thanks to the roadmap for EU accession.On the timing of the reconstruction, Mudra states that the war is still ongoing. Still, the important thing is to have a clear and transparent process, which is why they must create a legal context in advance to confiscate the Russian assets.In August, Mudra said trials could not be held for Ukrainian prisoners of war.At the same time, she that Ukraine records the crimes committed by Russian Federation and uses available international legal opportunities to ensure the rights of Ukrainian defenders held captive by the Russian occupiers.
In September, the media wrote about her: ""But even that is no easy task. Ukraine’s deputy justice minister, Iryna Mudra, this month is touring capitals in Europe and the U.S. to convince governments to track down assets of sanctioned Russians — and confiscate them... Mudra also wants the EU to confiscate Russian state assets, not just private ones, to use for the reconstruction of Ukraine. That plan, however, faces legal hurdles and is unlikely to become reality any time soon — which Mudra acknowledges.""
Iryna Mudra stated in September that her country has no prospects of receiving reparations from Russia in international courts. She explained that Russia had withdrawn from the Council of Europe and had agreed not to implement the decisions issued by the European Court of Human Rights after March 15. According to the Ukrainian politician, the Russian funds confiscated so far will not be enough to rebuild Ukraine.In September 2022, German politician Günter Krings wrote: ""Yesterday I was able to exchange views with the Ukrainian Minister of Justice, Denys Maliuska, his deputy Iryna Mudra and other colleagues from the Kyiv government, together with colleagues from the legal committee of our Bundestag. Ukrainian officials have demanded that oligarchs' assets be frozen and confiscated for future reparations claims. Natural and legal persons in Ukraine should receive compensation for it. Compensation should also be paid for environmental damage. Establishing a compensation fund and a register of all damages was suggested. Even before the summer break, we, as the Union, had called for the sanctions against oligarchs to be improved and will be happy to take up this topic and follow it closely.""
Later she attended the UK: ""Ukraine’s deputy justice minister, Iryna Mudra, was in London last week to discuss the issue with the Foreign Office after lobbying the Council of Europe’s council of ministers in Strasbourg alongside Olena Zelenska, the wife of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A former banker, Mudra has been at the helm of the detailed legal and political discussions on reparations, holding talks in Germany, Paris, and Brussels and with the US treasury assistant secretary, Elizabeth Rosenberg.""

== Civic and political activism ==
Starting in 2004, Orobets has actively participated in preparations for Ukrainian presidential elections.
According to analysts, Orobets may claim a record in the number of parliamentary appeals she has addressed to executive authorities at different levels of the government. Between 2011 and 2013 alone, Orobets sent over 800 appeals to government officials, which focused primarily on protecting the rights of citizens and combating corruption during various important procedures.

This mobilization of citizens forced the government to make a decision relating to the closure of the factory.Since 2010, she has also fought to prevent the formation of a rigid vertical system of administration in the field of science and education as well as Dmytro Tabachnyk's intended course of politicization of the field of science and education in the interests of the Party of Regions.
From 2010 to 2012, Orobets actively protested against attempts to falsify committee rulings and regulations. Orobets publicly turned to Volodymyr Lytvyn in 2011 with a request to renew the text of the law on banning tobacco advertisement, which was falsified before being given to the head of the Verkhovna Rada to sign.During the parliamentarian elections in 2012, Orobets defended the will of citizens of Cherkasy from falsification in district 194.One of her priorities as a Secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is that Ukraine signs an Association Agreement with the EU.


== Legislative initiatives ==
Her legislative priorities include the reform of primary, secondary and higher education, transparent and effective system of elections for units of representative government, and encouragement of charitable activities and leading a healthy lifestyle.
During her term in the 6th convocation of the Verkhovna Rada, Orobets prepared 35 regulatory propositions which included propositions on the reform of Ukraine's higher education system, standardization of independent evaluations as the single criteria for acceptance into universities, the increase of the right of individuals to basic education, a crucial proposition on the regulation of charitable organizations, and, alongside experts, the development of international charity funds. Of these, eight regulations, are already in effect. These regulations include, ""On public associations"", ""On the introduction of a moratorium on the closure of secondary schools in rural areas"", ""On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine to ban advertisements, sponsorships and promotion of sale of tobacco products"", ""On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine to pass laws to restrict tobacco product smoking spaces"" and more.Experts highlight the high effectiveness of Orobets' regulatory innovations in the sphere of corruption prevention and smoking reform aimed at the ban of tobacco product advertisement (first and second legislation), increasing the tobacco excise tax and banning smoking in public places (first and second legislation). As a result of these regulatory innovations, the level of smoking in Ukraine over the last five years has decreased 17% among men and double that figure among women. In fact, due to the introduction of the excise tax, in only nine months (January 2012 – September 2012) the Ukrainian budget received 12.8 billion UAH. Moreover, since September 16, 2012 all tobacco product advertisements have been banned in Ukraine. As of December 16, 2012, there has been a complete ban on smoking in all food service locations.Orobets is also actively struggling to solve the problems of Ukrainian orphans, specifically through the ratification of international agreements in this field.

President Viktor Yushchenko awarded Yuriy Orobets the Hero of Ukraine award posthumously in 2007. During the 2004 mayoral elections in Mukachevo, Yuriy Orobets actively struggled against the use of administrative resources and election fraud. He died in a car accident under suspicious circumstances before a special inquiry commission released a report about unlawful elections in Cherkasy. 
Lesya Orobets' mother is Oksana (Ukrainian: Оксана), a chemical engineer and pensioner.
Orobets is married to Oleksandr Omelchuk and has two daughters – Sofiya (16 December 2008) and Erika (25 August 2010). Omelchuk is Chairman of Phoenix Capital, a Ukraine-based investment bank.In November 2012, a few weeks after the 2012 parliamentary elections, Omelchuk landed in the center of media attention in relation to allegations of tax evasion and the Phoenix Capital office was searched on 13 November. This was seen by Orobets herself as a way of pressuring her into a pro-Presidential (Viktor Yanukovych) majority in the Verkhovna Rada and an attempt to monopolize the entire investment sector to ""the people close to power"". (According to Orobets) due to increasing political pressure, Omelchuk was forced to flee the country in June 2013. She added that she was receiving anonymous phone threats. Late June 2013 the leaders of the three opposition political groups - Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Vitaliy Klychko and Oleh Tyahnybok - along with over one hundred other MPs signed a claim to stop the politically motivated persecution of opposition MPs and members of their families.
