10,"Valentina Ivanovna Matviyenko (née Tyutina; born 7 April 1949) is a Russian politician and diplomat serving as a Senator from Saint Petersburg and the Chairwoman of the Federation Council since 2011. Previously she was Governor of Saint Petersburg from 2003 to 2011.
Born in the Ukrainian SSR, Matviyenko began her political career in the 1980s in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and was the First Secretary of the Krasnogvardeysky District Communist Party of the city from 1984 to 1986. In the 1990s, Matviyenko served as the Russian Ambassador to Malta (1991–1995), and to Greece (1997–1998). From 1998 to 2003, Matviyenko was Deputy Prime Minister for Welfare, and briefly the Presidential Envoy to the Northwestern Federal District in 2003. By that time, Matviyenko was firmly allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin, an alliance which secured her a victory in the gubernatorial elections in Saint Petersburg, Putin's native city.
Matviyenko became the first female leader of Saint Petersburg. Since the start of Matviyenko's service as governor, a significant share of taxation money was transferred from the federal budget to the local budget, and along with the booming economy and improving investment climate the standard of living significantly increased in the city, making income levels much closer to Moscow, and far above most other Russian federal subjects. The profile of Saint Petersburg in Russian politics has risen, marked by the transfer of the Constitutional Court of Russia from Moscow in 2008. Matviyenko developed a large number of megaprojects in housing and infrastructure, such as the construction of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, including the Big Obukhovsky Bridge (the only non-draw bridge over the Neva River in the city), completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam aimed to put an end to the infamous Saint Petersburg floods, launching Line 5 of Saint Petersburg Metro, and starting land reclamation in the Neva Bay for the new Marine Facade of the city (the largest European waterfront development project) containing the Passenger Port of St. Petersburg. Several major auto-producing companies were drawn to Saint Petersburg or its vicinity, including Toyota, General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai Motor, Suzuki, Magna International, Scania, and MAN SE (all having plants in the Shushary industrial zone), thus turning the city into an important center of automotive industry in Russia, specializing in foreign brands. Another development of Matviyenko's governorship was tourism; by 2010 the number of tourists in Saint Petersburg doubled and reached 5.2 million, which placed the city among the top five tourist centers in Europe.Some actions and practices of Governor Matviyenko have drawn significant criticisms from the Saint Petersburg public, the media, and opposition groups. In particular, new construction in already heavily built-up areas and several building projects were deemed to conflict with the classical architecture of the city, where the entire centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some projects eventually were cancelled or modified, such as the controversial design of a 400-metre-tall Okhta Center skyscraper, planned to be built adjacent to the historical center of the city; however, after a public campaign and the personal involvement of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, it was relocated from Okhta to the Lakhta suburb. Another major point of criticism was Matviyenko's handling of the city's snow removal problems during the unusually cold and snowy winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11. On 22 August 2011, soon after completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam, Matviyenko resigned from office. As a member of the ruling United Russia Party, on 21 September 2011, Matviyenko was elected as Chairwoman of the Federation Council, the country's third-highest elected office.


== Early life ==
Valentina Tyutina was born in Shepetivka in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast of Western Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. In 1972, Matviyenko graduated from Leningrad Institute of Chemistry and Pharmaceutics, where she met her husband, Vladimir Vasilyevich Matviyenko. They had a son, Sergey, in 1973. Matviyenko held various leadership positions within the Komsomol organization until 1984.


== Early political career ==
Valentina Matviyenko graduated from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Academy in 1985 and became a party official in Leningrad's municipal government. In 1984–1986, she was the First Secretary of the Krasnogvardeysky District Committee of the Party.
Matviyenko was elected as a people's deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and headed the committee on women, family and children affairs.
Between 1991 and 1998, Matviyenko served in the diplomatic service and held diplomatic positions including posts of Russian ambassador to Malta (1991–1995) and Greece (1997–1998).
On 24 September 1998, Matviyenko was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Russia for Welfare, and occupied this position until 2003.
In June 1999 she worked on the board of directors of the ORT TV channel.
On 3 February 2000, she was nominated for the presidency, but refused to contest. On 29 February 2000, she announced that she was considering running in the St. Petersburg governor elections to be held on 14 May, and on 10 March announced that she was indeed launching her campaign. However, on 4 April she claimed that Vladimir Putin had asked her to withdraw from the elections, and she did so on 5 April.
On 11 March 2003, she left the Deputy PM position and was appointed presidential envoy to the Northwestern Federal District by Vladimir Putin.

=== Election ===

Her nomination was supported by the United Russia political party and President Vladimir Putin. Putin publicly supported her candidacy on 2 September in a meeting that was broadcast by two state-owned TV stations. Previously, at the end of June, the new management of local channel St. Petersburg Television shut down a range of analytical programmes on local politics, which was thought to be one of the factors in elections outcome.In the first round of elections held on 21 September 2003, Matviyenko came first with 48.61% of the vote, followed by Anna Markova, a former member of Yakovlev's staff, with 15.89%. 10.97 percent of the electorate voted against all nine nominees. Turnout was low at just 29%. On 5 October 2003, Matviyenko won the second round with 63 percent (vs. 24% for Anna Markova) and was elected governor of Saint Petersburg, the head of the Saint Petersburg City Administration. She became the first female head of government of Saint Petersburg.


=== Confirmation in office ===
In 2005, a new Russian federal law came into force whereby governors are proposed by the President of Russia and approved or disapproved by regional legislative assemblies rather than elected by direct popular vote. On 6 December 2006, one year before her term as elected governor would expire, Valentina Matviyenko asked Vladimir Putin to nominate her for approval according to the new legislation, and he agreed. She was approved by the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly on 22 December 2006.


=== Public protests ===
On 3 March 2007, scores of participants of the Dissenters' March, organized by marginal opposition parties, demonstrated in the city's main avenue, Nevsky Prospekt, calling for governor Matviyenko's dismissal. She in turn accused them of stirring up trouble ahead of elections to the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly scheduled for 11 March, of criticising the city's perceived dynamic development and for allegedly receiving financial support from dubious sources. On 15 April 2007, the Dissenters' March took place in Saint Petersburg for the second time.


=== Assassination attempt ===
On 19 May 2007, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation announced it had detained several members of an undisclosed youth religious group on 16 May who were alleged to be preparing an assassination attempt on Valentina Matviyenko's life using hand grenades and plastic explosive.


=== City development ===


==== Budget and incomes ====
Matviyenko electoral promises included the transfer of a significant share of taxation money from the federal budget to the local one, which was supported by President Putin, a native of Saint Petersburg. 


==== Political profile ====
New governor pledged her support for the idea of transferring some part of the capital's functions from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. The role of Saint Petersburg in Russian politics has risen, marked by the transfer of the Constitutional Court of Russia from Moscow in 2008. The city's main television broadcast, Petersburg – Channel 5, in October 2006 was licensed to broadcast nationwide again.


==== Infrastructure ====
Matviyenko developed a large number of megaprojects in housing and infrastructure, such as building of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road including the Big Obukhovsky Bridge (the only non-draw bridge over the Neva River in the city), completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam aimed to put an end to ill-famous Saint Petersburg floods, launching Line 5 of Saint Petersburg Metro.


==== Industry ====
Several major auto-producing companies were drawn to Saint Petersburg or its vicinity, including Toyota, General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai Motor, Suzuki, Magna International, Scania and MAN SE (all having plants in Shushary industrial zone).


==== Tourism ====
The city administration launched a number of programs aimed to increase the number of tourist arrivals (such as advertisement campaigns abroad) and to improve the tourist infrastructure in the city, including the construction of new hotels. Between 2003 and 2010, the number of tourists in Saint Petersburg doubled and reached 5.2 million, which placed the city among the top 5 tourist centers in Europe.


==== Culture ====
The June celebration of the graduation from school, the Scarlet Sails (a part of the White Nights Festival), rose to a new scale under Matviyenko.


=== Criticism ===


==== Controversial construction projects ====
The new construction in already heavily built-up areas was a point of continuous criticism during Matviyenko's governorship. Of especial note were a number of building projects deemed by many experts and conservative public to contradict the classical architecture of the city where the entire centre is UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Matviyenko supported the construction project of the Gazprom City business center (also called Okhta Center) including a 400-meter skyscraper holding the headquarters of some of Gazprom's subsidiaries on the right bank of the Neva River in the vicinity of the historic Smolny Cathedral. The current regulations forbidding construction buildings of more than 42 meters (48 with expert approval) were specially changed by the city administration for the project.
By the end of her governor service, Matviyenko more eagerly engaged in dialogue with the groups of the so-called gradozaschitniki (градозащитники, ""city-defenders""). A number of controversial projects eventually were cancelled or modified. Notably, after an extensive public protest campaign, which lasted several years, and after the personal involvement of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the Okhta Center was relocated from Okhta to Lakhta suburb.
Other controversial projects include the Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage and the reconstruction of the New Holland Island. Both projects required destruction of some of the earlier historic buildings, and the new stage of the Mariinsky Theatre was originally attempted to be built according to a highly original design by French architect Dominique Perrault, resembling a cocoon. The project, however, was deemed too costly and too much out-of-line with the surrounding classical architecture, and the design was changed.


==== Snow cleaning problems ====
Matviyenko's handling of the cleaning of the city from snow during the unusually cold and snowy winters of 2009–2010 and 2010–2011, in the last two years of her governorship, drew criticism, especially from the automobile owners and drivers in the city. The authorities were unprepared for vast amounts of snow on the city streets, especially in the historical centre, and there was a lack of snow cleaning equipment.


==== Accusations of corporate raiding ====
Businessman Vitaly Arkhangelsky accused Matviyenko of corporate raiding and corruption. According to him, Matviyenko is the real owner of the Bank Saint Petersburg that staged a corporate raid on the property of his company, OMG that included Vyborg Port and Western Terminal of Saint Petersburg port using falsified documents with Arkhangelsky's forged signature. The lawyers of Bank Saint Petersburg insist on exclusion materials of Matviyenko's involvement from the criminal case in London court.


== Chairwoman of the Federation Council ==
On 22 August 2011, soon after completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam along with the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, Matviyenko resigned from the office of the governor of Saint Petersburg. Georgy Poltavchenko was appointed as acting governor in her place. She was backed by President Dmitry Medvedev as a candidate to head the Federal Assembly or Upper House of the Russian Federation. The previous speaker of the Federation Council, Sergey Mironov, was recalled in May after criticising Matviyenko's handling of Saint Petersburg. The leader of A Just Russia party, Mironov was ousted by the majority United Russia and replaced by an acting speaker Aleksandr Torshin.As a member of United Russia party, Matviyenko stood in a municipal election in August in order to have legal possibilities to attain the office in the Federation Council. She won the municipal election with more than 95% of the vote, despite having 18% approval rating in July, for which she was criticized by the opposition.


== Sanctions ==
Due to her role in the Crimean status referendum, Matviyenko became one of the first people put under executive sanctions by United States President Barack Obama. The sanctions freeze her assets in the US and ban her from entering the United States. She was put on a sanction list by the United States and Canada on 17 March 2014, the European Union on 21 March 2014, Switzerland on 2 April 2014, Liechtenstein on 17 April 2014, Australia on 19 June 2014, and Ukraine on 16 October 2016.Sanctioned by the UK government in 2014 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War.In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 6 April 2022 the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury added Matviyenko to its list of persons sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order 14024.


== Family ==
Valentina Matviyenko has a son, Sergey (ru, born 5 May 1973), with her husband, Vladimir Vasilyevich Matviyenko. In May 2003, Sergey Matviyenko was appointed vice-president of the Bank Saint Petersburg. Later he also became vice-president and first vice-president (2005) of Vneshtorgbank. Sergey married Zara Mgoyan, a Russian pop singer of Armenian and Kurdish origin (b. 1983) on 30 April 2004, but they divorced a year later.

== Biography ==


=== Yaroslavl ===
Yelena Borisovna Mizulina was born on December 9, 1954, in the city of Buy in Kostroma Oblast, Soviet Union. In 1972 she began studying at the Faculty of Law and History of the Yaroslavl State University where she first met her future husband Mikhail Mizulin. They were married after their fourth year as undergraduates at university. She graduated in 1977 with a law degree and worked as a research assistant of the same university.Between 1977 and 1984, she worked as a consultant, and then from 1984, as head consultant in the Yaroslavl regional court. In parallel she obtained a Candidate of Sciences degree via distance learning from the Kazan State University. In 1983 she successfully defended a dissertation entitled ""The nature of supervisory review in the criminal process (based on the material provided by the Yaroslavl Regional Court)"".In 1985, she became Senior Research Associate to Yaroslavl State Pedagogical University named after K.D. Ushinsky. Her husband later confessed that he had taken advantage of his job as the head of the ideology in the Yaroslavl Oblast to obtain the job for Yelena.

She remained a member of the Communist Party until 1991.In 1992, she obtained a Doctor of Science in Law degree (see Education in Russia) entitled Criminal code: the concept of self-limiting country at the Institute of State and Law. In regard to this dissertation Yelena Mizulina has publicly declared the following: ""It seemed that what I wrote was unique, and that I was indeed a learned person of God"" (in Russian ""казалось, что то, что я написала — уникально, что я, действительно, учёный от Бога""). Between 1992 and 1995, she was a docent and subsequently a professor at Yaroslavl State University.


=== Member of Yabloko ===
In 1993, she joined the Russian legislature from the political union ""The Russian Choice"" and was elected to the Federal Council (upper house of parliament in the Russian Federation), where she became the Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Legislation and Judicial and Legal Matters, a member of the Committee on Regulation of Parliamentary Procedures.In 1995, she joined the opposition pro-democratic political party Yabloko and the group ""Reformi – the new direction"" (in Russian ""Реформы — новый курс""). From 1995 and on, she was the head of the Yaroslavl regional and public organisation Ravnovsie (in Russian ""Равновесие"" he Federation Council).In December 1995, Muzilina was elected a member of parliament Duma from the Kirov region representing the political party Yabloko. As a result, she resigned her position in the Federation Council in January 1996.
As a parliament member of the Duma, she held the position of the Deputy Chairman of Committee on Legislation and Judicial-legal Reforms and Deputy of the Subcommittee on Matters of State building and Constitutional Rights of Citizens. Muzilina was also involved in the legal implementation of the failed attempt to carry out the impeachment of Boris Yeltsin.In December 1999, she was elected member of Russian parliament, the Duma, from the Yabloko party. In July 2000, she became the head of the 'Yaroslavl Union of Democratic Forces' (in Russian ""Ярославский союз демократических сил""), which was composed of members of the Yabloko party and the Union of Right Forces.


=== Member in Union of Right Forces ===
In February 2001, she announced that she would discontinue her membership in the Yabloko party and in June of the same year she joined the Union of Right Forces party.She explained her decision to leave Yabloko by the fact that she was ""ashamed to be in a party that had obtained only 5% during elections. This had become a moral problem"". Her former colleagues from Yabloko and Union of Right Forces Sergey Mitrokhin and Leonid Gozman have accused Yelena Mizulina of changing her political affiliation to keep up with political trends.After the Union of Right Forces lost the 2003 legislative elections, Mizulina, no longer an elected parliament member, was appointed to the Constitutional Court of Russia as the representative of the Duma. In this position, she was a proponent of local governors being no longer elected but rather directly nominated by the president of the Russian Federation.As a member of the Constitutional Court, she also worked as the Deputy Head of the Legal Department of the Duma and she graduated from the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration in 2005.

The sanctions freeze her assets in the US and ban her from entering the United States.She was sanctioned by the UK government in 2014 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War.


== Legislative work ==
Yelena Mizulina is among the lead authors of a set of controversial legislative projects including:

2010 bill on On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development
2012 Internet Restriction Bill.
Future amendment to the bill On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development that would block all websites containing swearing and the usage of mat. Opponents to the Internet Restriction Bill stressed that under the pretext of protecting children, this bill provides overwhelming tools for a broad scale Internet censorship and a limitation of freedom of speech in Russia. This protest has leading to public outcry such as the Russian-language Wikipedia strike. On June 10, 2012, she incriminated foreign intervention in these protests and therefore, she announced that she would issue an inquiry to the ministry of justice of the US. She also claimed that the Internet protests were organized by a ""pedophile lobby"".
2013 Anti-Magnitsky bill denying Americans the right to adopt Russian children. Following this proposal, US authorities have responded by proposing to include Y. Mizulina, along with Vitaly Milonov within the Magnitsky list of banned Russian personalities.
2014 bill preventing women from entering higher education before giving birth.
2017 bill to decriminalise domestic violence ""first assaults which cause less serious injuries"" to an administrative offence.On November 14, 2012, Yelena Muzilina declared that the 'prophylactic goals' of Internet Restriction Bill of ' acquiring a safe information space on the web without making use of punitive measures' had been accomplished. She also disclosed a possible future legislative project that would prevent access to sites previously included in the Russian Internet blacklist. Among such portals are expected to fall rublacklist.net belonging to Pirate Party of Russia.


== Views on marriage, family and sexual relations ==
Yelena Mizulina in recent times became concerned with birth rates, in her role as Chair of the Duma Committee on Family, Women and Children Affairs. In an interview with Vladimir Posner she has expressed the following views: ""Analyzing all the circumstances, and the particularity of territorial Russia and her survival ... I came to the conclusion that if today we want to resolve the demographic crisis, we need to, excuse me, tighten the belt on certain moral values and information, so that giving birth and raising children become fully valued"".


=== Position on abortion ===
Yelena Muzilina believes in limiting women's right to abortion. She has proposed to let abortions remain free of charge only for medical reasons and in cases of rape. In all other cases, she believes abortions should be billed to the abortion-seeking woman. She has also publicly spoken out against abortions being carried out in private medical institutions, and in favor of a ban on selling products that result in abortions without a prescription from a physician. She believes in obtaining the consent of the husband by all married women before carrying out an abortion, and in the case of underaged women – the consent of their parents.In July 2013, Yelena Mizulina was part of a group of members of parliament that proposed legislation affecting the Offences Code of Russia that would result in a fine of 1 million rubles on doctors and medical institutions that carried out abortions on women without providing them a 'waiting period' to reflect on their decision to abort. It was also proposed to fine the pregnant women that did not respect this ""quiet time"" up to 3,000–5,000 rubles.


=== Position on family and marriage ===
Yelena Mizulina has expressed strong views concerning the adoption of Russian children by US citizens: ""This is just mean, not to say despicable. Russia has never defended its interest at the expense of children"". Two month later, she voted for the Anti-Magnitsky bill, a law that bans United States citizens from adopting Russian children.In June 2012, the Duma Committee on matters of Family that Mizulina presides, rendered public a project entitled ""The State Concept of Family Policy until 2025"", which proposes amongst other things, several controversial elements including the following:

introduction of a tax on divorce
condemnation of the birth of children out of wedlock
proposition of new restrictions on abortion
strong condemnation of homosexuality
proposition to strengthen the role of the church in passing legislation relative to family matters
increase of the number of multi-generational families (families where grandparents, parents and grandchildren live together).
recommendation to actively advocate multiple births
determination of the minimum sum of child support, and proposition that it be implemented independently of the parent's income status.Opposition journalists including Alexander Nikonov have speculated that the divorce of Vladimir Putin that took place two days after the publication of the legislative project was precipitated by the proposed fine on divorce.After the publication of the ""Concept"", it was pointed out that some of the positions described in it had been plagiarized verbatim from a school report published in a free access on the Internet, which itself was plagiarized from a curriculum on family studies in the Tomsk Polytechnic University.In this context, she has also called for the removal from Russian airwaves of the satirical cartoon South Park.Yelena Mizulina believes in raising the age of consent in sexual relations in Russia from 16 to 18 years.Contrary to the clause 30 of Citizen's health protection Law of Russia, she proposed to ban surrogate motherhood pointing out that the latter threatens not just for Russia to survive but also to the survival of entire humanity and is an analogy to the banning of nuclear weapons.


=== Position on LGBT issues ===
Yelena Mizulina is the author of several legislative projects directed against ""propaganda of homosexuality"" including the infamous Russian LGBT propaganda law. She believes that the phrase ""gays are people too"" should be considered potentially extremist by the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare. Yelena Mizulina is also in favor of confiscating children from gay parents, including biological parents.In July 2013, Mizulina and Olga Batalina, her deputy in the Duma Committee, filed a complaint at the Institution of Criminal Proceedings against the LGBT rights activist Nikolay Alexeyev. According to Mizulina, Alexeyev is the ""leader"" of the LGBT community and has launched a campaign to discredit her, ""to the detriment of Russia as a whole"". Mizulina stated she wanted Alexeyev's punishment to be ""in the form of compulsory work in a place where he can not proceed with propaganda, for example, driving a hearse"". Representatives of the LGBT community have also appealed to the prosecutor's office with a complaint against Mizulina for inciting hatred against homosexuals and for infringing on the LGBT rights in Russia.


=== Accusation of political opponents of belonging to a ""pedophile lobby"" ===
Yelena Mizulina has accused several of her political opponents of belonging to a so-called ""pedophile lobby"" She first suggested that ""in the depths of the United Russia party there was a ""pedophile lobby"" that was against toughening the law on sexual offenses against minors in 2011 during the evaluation of the Criminal Code of Russia.Those opposing the law on On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development were also accused by Yelena Mizulina of being part of a ""pedophile lobby"". In 2012, in regard to the Russian-language Wikipedia protest against the Duma's reading of the bill On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development, Mizulina said:

This is a coverup. Wikipedia itself is not threatened. I too use Wikipedia. Notice, how only the Russian-language version was closed down. Therefore [I believe that ..] this is an attempt to blackmail the Russian parliament. Behind this there stands a lobby, and suspicions are high that it is ""pedophile lobby"".
In June 2013, the writer and former Russian Vice Prime Minister Alfred Koch published an article concerning Mizulina's son that lives in Belgium and works for the large international law firm called Mayer Brown that sponsors pro-gay associations and organizations and is among the hundreds on pro-LGBT rights organizations in Belgium, whilst his mother is waging war on homosexuality in Russia. In response to this, Mizulina accused Koch of being a member of a ""pedophile lobby"". The journalist Andrei Malgin wrote a piece in his blog entitled ""Great: anyone that Mizulina doesn't like is a ""pedophile lobby"".


=== Decriminalisation of domestic violence ===
In July 2016, The Moscow Times reported that Senator Mizulina had proposed amendments to present legislation to downgrade spousal and child abuse from a criminal offense to an administrative misdemeanor offense. Mizulina publicly stated her opinion that the present laws against domestic violence, in which the convicted are subject to fines and a two-year prison sentence, are ""absurd"" suggesting that such a punishment is excessive for ""just a slap.""On 11 January 2017, during the first reading of the law, 368 Russian lawmakers voted in favour of the law, one deputy voted against and another abstained.


== Investigation of alleged defamation of Mizulina ==
In June 2013, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal investigation concerning the alleged defamation of Mizulina by a group of people consisting of:

journalist of Novaya Gazeta Yelena Kostyuchenko
gay-rights activist Nikolay Alexeyev
journalist-socialite Kseniya Sobchak
economist, writer former Russian Vice-Prime Minister Alfred KochAccording to Yelena Mizulina bloggers disseminated false information concerning her alleged intention to ban oral sex in Russia. Ksenia Sobchak has communicated to the press that she was interrogated by an investigator on the topic of oral sex. Similarly, Alfred Koch claims that he was interrogated for three hours concerning the ""gay-oral phobia of Mizulina"" and his position concerning the latter.


== Criticism ==
The Russian political scientist Mark Urnov has described the laws instigated by Yelena Mizulina as ""diverse, but having a single common quality – their capacity to spread intolerance. They are simply a legal expression of the intolerance and the suppression of everything that corresponds to one's personal views in regard to what is right and wrong"".The writer Dmitri Bykov believes that Yelena Mizulina is ""constantly providing a legislative form for things that should remain a question of personal choice, which is far more dangerous than any gay pride parade"".In April 2019 Mizulina was widely quoted for her statement in defense of Russian Internet censorship laws, which were characterized as Orwellian by many journalists:
What are rights? They’re the biggest lack of freedom. I can tell you that the more rights you have, the less free we are. A ban is when the person is free because it says ""this is impossible, but with everything else — [you can] do what you want.""


== Personal life ==
Yelena Mizulina is married and has two adult children.Her husband Mikhail Muzilin holds a PhD in Philosophy and is a docent at the Faculty of Political Sciences of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. He was the head of the Yabloko party headquarters in Yaroslavl. He has also formerly served as dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Yaroslavl State University.Her son Nikolay Mizulin lives in Brussels with his wife and two children where he works as a lawyer in the firm Mayer Brown. This family connection caused a controversy when former Russian Vice Prime Minister Alfred Koch alleged that Nikolay's employer, US law firm Mayer Brown, which supports LGBT rights, might be in breach of the anti-gay laws instigated by Russian government and spearheaded by Nikolay's mother. After the publication, Alfred Koch was interrogated by Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for three hours, based on accusations by Yelena Mizulina. Also, Mizulina was quoted as saying that Alfred Koch is a part of ""paedophile lobby"", trying to hinder the Russian government's campaign against sexual criminals.Mizulina's daughter Ekaterina is the head of the Moscow Fund of Social-Legal Initiatives ""The Rights Capital"" (in Russian ""Правовая столица""), a firm that acts as a financial intermediary, publishing and advertising, which was reported to belong in fact to Yelena Mizulina.In the law proposed by Yelena Mizulina entitled ""Concept of the State Family Policy until 2025."" (in Russian ""Концепции государственной семейной политики до 2025 года""), she has defined the 'ideal family' as marriage with the goal of commonly bringing up three or more children'. In this law she also proposes several generations of Russian parents, children and grandchildren should inhabit the same place. In a recent interview with the opposition radio station Echo of Moscow, Mizulina when asked why she herself had not conformed with the 'ideal family' she responded the following way: ""I wanted three children, Misha [Mikhail – her husband] also wanted three. But things happen as they did. Fate has given us two"".In 1994, a polemic broke out when she requested a larger state-provided flat in the goal of exotic cat breeding.

15,"Elvira Sakhipzadovna Nabiullina (Russian: Эльвира Сахипзадовна Набиуллина; Tatar: Эльвира Сәхипзадә кызы Нәбиуллина, romanized: Elvira Säxipzadä qızı Näbiullina; Bashkir: Эльвира Сәхипзада ҡыҙы Нәбиуллина; born 29 October 1963) is a Russian economist and current head of the Central Bank of Russia. She was president Vladimir Putin's economic adviser from May 2012 to June 2013 after serving as the minister of economic development from September 2007 to May 2012. As of 2019, she was listed as the 53rd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. She has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.


== Early life and education ==
Nabiullina was born in Ufa, Bashkir ASSR, on 29 October 1963 into an ethnic Tatar family. Her father, Sakhipzada Saitzadayevich, was a driver, while her mother, Zuleikha Khamatnurovna, was a factory manager. Nabiullina graduated from school No. 31 of Ufa, followed by the Moscow State University Faculty of Economics in 1986. In subsequent years, she was selected for the 2007 Yale World Fellows program.


== Career ==
Between 1991 and 1994, Nabiullina worked at the USSR Science and Industry Union and its successor, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In 1994, she moved to the Ministry for Economic Development and Trade, where she rose to the level of deputy minister by 1997; she left the ministry in 1998. She spent the next two years with Sberbank as its chief executive and with former Economic Development and Trade Minister Herman Gref's non-governmental think tank, the Center for Strategic Development, before returning to the Ministry for Economic Development and Trade as first deputy in 2000. Between 2003 and her September 2007 appointment as minister, she chaired the Center for Strategic Development as well as an advisory committee preparing for Russia's 2006 presidency of the G8.
Russian President Putin appointed Nabiullina to the post of minister of economic development and trade on 24 September 2007, replacing Gref. She found working with then-deputy premier and finance minister Alexei Kudrin ""difficult but always interesting"" and remained in that position until 21 May 2012. In 2012 she was one of six senior government figures to accompany Putin back to the Kremlin administration after Putin was elected president of Russia for a third term. From May 2012 to June 2013, she served as Assistant to President Putin for Economic Affairs.Succeeding Sergey Ignatyev in 2013, Nabiullina was appointed head of the Central Bank of Russia, becoming the second woman after Tatiana Paramonova to hold that position, and thus the first Russian woman in the G8. In May 2014 she was named one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes, which noted that she ""has been given the difficult task of managing the ruble exchange rate during Russian military operation in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea and facilitating growth for an economy trying to avoid a recession"". In an effort to stop the ruble's slide, the Central Bank of Russia, under her leadership, hiked interest rates, free-floated the exchange rate, and kept a cap on inflation, thus stabilizing the financial system and boosting foreign-investor confidence. Euromoney magazine named her their 2015 Central Bank Governor of the Year.In 2017, the British magazine The Banker chose Nabiullina as ""Central Banker of the Year, Europe"".On 28 February 2022, she gave a speech announcing a number of measures to combat the 2022 Russian financial crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including that the Central Bank of Russia's interest rate would rise to 20%, that the stock market be closed, and that capital controls would be instituted. In March 2022, it was reported that she had attempted to resign her position, only to be ordered to stay in post by Putin. In September 2022, the United States Treasury Department sanctioned Nabiullina.


=== ""Nabiullina's brooch"" ===
There is a belief in the Russian media that the head of the Central Bank uses brooches at public events to signal the state of the economy and the regulator's plans. In 2020, Nabiullina appeared at press conferences with a brooch of a blue wave, a dot, a tumbler, a stork. In March 2021, when the increase in the refinancing rate was announced for the first time in three years, she appeared with a hawk.In September 2021, Nabiullina revealed the meaning of the brooches, which represent her own way of communication, an alternate language to ""give the market a chance to reflect"". Meanwhile, according to Nabiullina, the exact significance of any brooch should remain mysterious and is with rare exceptions ambiguous.In her speech on 28 February 2022 announcing measures to alleviate the 2022 Russian financial crisis she wore black attire and no brooch. Sergei Guriev of Sciences Po speculated that it ""should not be read as she disagreed with Putin's policy, but as a sign that it is time to bury normal monetary policy,"" while adding that ""I am sure she was not part of the narrow circle making the decision on going to war.""


== Personal life ==
In the late 1980s while studying at the graduate school of Moscow State University, Nabiullina married a lecturer there, Yaroslav Kuzminov. Kuzminov became rector of National Research University Higher School of Economics (1994-2021), since July 2021 the academic supervisor of the HSE. They have a son, Vasiliy (born 13 August 1988), at present a Research Fellow at the HSE.


=== Sanctions ===
On 19 April 2022, Nabiullina was sanctioned by Australia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 30 September 2022, after the Russian annexation of southern and eastern Ukraine, she was sanctioned by the United States. She was also sanctioned by New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

Between 1982 and 1989 Narochnitskaya worked at the Secretariat-General of the United Nations in New York.
In the 1990s  Narochnitskaya was a member of several minor political parties in Russia, including Constitutional Democratic Party and Derzhava. She gained some publicity as an advocate of the greater political role of the Russian Orthodox Church and her support of the Russian military actions in Chechnya in 1994-1996. Narochnitskaya was also an outspoken opponent of NATO intervention in former Yugoslavia and of NATO expansion, having called recognition of state continuity for the Baltics a ploy ""to dilute the obstacles to the entry of parts of historic Russia into NATO.""Narochnitskaya was elected to parliament as a representative (but not member) of the Rodina block in 2003 and served as vice chairman of the international affairs committee in the State Duma. She was not reelected in 2007.
Narochnitskaya Was a protege of the spymaster Yevgeny Primakov at the institute for World Economy in Moscow during the time of the perestroika reforms. ( p.433 . Putins People, Catherine Bolton)
Narochnitskaya advocates that an indispensable condition for the success of Russia's foreign policy in the modern world is the renewal and detailed study of traditional pre-Soviet foundations of Russian diplomacy. Considered to be a conservative, Narochinitskaya has argued for ""full legal continuity"" with pre-Soviet Russia and views post-World War I Bolshevik treaties, which reduced the sovereign Russian territory, as illegitimate.In January 2008, Narochnitskaya was appointed director of the Paris-based Institute of Democracy and Cooperation, a Russia-funded NGO.She is an author of several works dedicated to Russian history; antiglobalism; and international, political and spiritual affairs.
Narochinitskaya is often criticized for failing to adhere to the stated purpose of IDC to create “a bridge of solid friendship between two great European nations”. In her numerous interviews she has put forward very hostile views, claiming that the West wants to subjugate Russia, impose its rules on it, even “dismember” it. She is often seen on state TV channels corroborating Putin's claims that the opposition movement in Russia is funded and coordinated by the NATO nations.

19,"Valeriya Ilyinichna Novodvorskaya (Russian: Вале́рия Ильи́нична Новодво́рская; 17 May 1950 – 12 July 2014) was a Soviet dissident, writer and liberal politician. She was the founder and the chairwoman of the Democratic Union party and a member of the editorial board of The New Times.


== Biography ==
Novodvorskaya was born in 1950 in Baranavichy, Byelorussian SSR to a Jewish engineer, Ilya Borisovich (Boruchovich) Burshtyn, and a pediatrician, Nina Feodorovna Novodvorskaya, who came from a noble Russian family. Her parents divorced in 1967; Ilya Borisovich later emigrated to North America.
Novodvorskaya was active in the Soviet dissident movement since her youth, and first imprisoned by the Soviet authorities in 1969, when she was 19, for distributing leaflets that criticized the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The leaflets included her poetry about the Soviet Communist Party:

She was arrested and imprisoned at a Soviet psychiatric hospital and, like many other Soviet dissidents, diagnosed with ""sluggish schizophrenia"". In the early 1990s, psychiatrists of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia proved that the claim of her mental illness was false. She described her experience in her book Beyond Despair.
Based on the materials of the case, the Moscow prosecutor's office of the USSR compiled the following certificate (revealed only in 1999):
Novodvorskaya V. I. (born in 1950, Jew, member of the Komsomol, secondary education, student at the Torez Institute of Foreign Languages, Moscow) […] In December 1969, in the Kremlin Hall of Performances, she scattered a large number of anti-Soviet leaflets in the stalls. March 16, 1970
Novodvorskaya stood as a Democratic Union candidate in the 1993 Russian legislative election in a single-mandate district as part of the Russia's Choice bloc, and she also contested the 1995 Russian legislative election on the list of the Party of Economic Freedom. She was not elected in either election, and never held public office.In 2009, Novodvorskaya published an autobiographical book, Farewell of Slavianka.


== Views ==
Novodvorskaya self-identified primarily as a liberal politician and was described by her colleagues as ""a critic of Russian realities in the best traditions of Pyotr Chaadayev, Vissarion Belinsky and Alexander Herzen"".In the 1990s, she was strongly critical of the reintroduction of Soviet propaganda in Russia and the First Chechen War. Her consistent criticism of Russia's past and present, of political and social life, as well as her extravagant lifestyle granted her titles such as ""the eternal dissident"" and ""an idealist at the edge of madness"".On 27 January 1995, the Office of the Prosecutor-General launched the Novodvorskaya Case in reaction to her interview given to Estonian journalists on 6 April 1994 where she stated that she ""cannot imagine how can anyone love a Russian for his laziness, for his lying, for his poverty, for his spinelessness, for his slavery"", as well as several publications in Novy Vzglyad and other periodicals. According to the prosecution, she denigrated rights of Russians in Estonia and claimed that ""manic depression"" was the major trait of Russian people which defined all their national history.All materials were checked for ""propaganda of civil war"", ""of inferiority of people based on their ethnicity"" and ""incitement to hatred"". Henri Reznik who defended her in court insisted that Novodvorkaya had only expressed her opinion ""similarly to Pyotr Chaadayev, Nikolai Gogol, Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Lenin"". The case lasted for two years and was closed in June 1997 for the ""lack of crime"". However Novy Vzglyad stopped publishing her articles, and its founder Yevgeny Dodolev later dedicated a critical book to Novodvorskaya and her case.Aleksandr Dugin, Igor Shafarevich, Sergey Kara-Murza, Yevgeny Dodolev, Vladimir Bushin and a few others accused Novodvorskaya of expressing anti-Russian views and condemning Russian history while idealizing Western civilization and the United States.Novodvorskaya strongly opposed the Second Chechen War and Vladimir Putin's domestic and foreign policies.

According to Novodvorskaya, it was Russian governmental policies in Chechnya that turned Shamil Basayev into a terrorist. In response, Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of the liberal radio station Echo of Moscow, banned her from appearing on their programs.Novodvorskaya accused the Russian government of murdering Polish president Lech Kaczyński in a plane crash on 10 April 2010 in Smolensk Oblast.She supported Georgia in the Russo-Georgian War and Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War.


== Personal life ==
Throughout her life, Novodvorskaya lived in a flat with her mother Nina Fyodorovna (Нина Федоровна Новодворская, 1928–2017), a pediatrician, and cat Stasik. In the summers, they rented a dacha in Kratovo. She was fond of swimming, science fiction, theater and cats.In 1990, Novodvorskaya was baptized by the non-canonical Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Reunited. She belonged to the church until her death while remaining highly critical of the KGB-controlled Russian Orthodox Church. According to her priest Yakov Krotov, ""she was more of a Christian than I ever was.""


== Death ==
On 12 July 2014, Novodvorskaya died of toxic shock syndrome, which arose from a phlegmon of the left foot.
Mikhail Gorbachev gave this description of Novodvorskaya on the day of her memorial service: ""She was a unique personality in the democratic movement. Exceptionally fearless, categorical and adamant in defending her views, Valeria Ilyinichna always drew fire on herself. The indomitable spirit of an idealist fighter lived in her.""


== Awards ==
Novodvorskaya received the Galina Starovoitova Award ""for contribution to the defense of human rights and strengthening democracy in Russia"". She said at the ceremony that ""we are not in opposition to, but in confrontation with, the present regime"".She was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in 2008.

She was the Chairman of the Commission of the Presidium of the General Council of the Party for consideration of complaints of citizens expelled from the party members, Chairman of the Commission of the Presidium of the General Council of the Party for interaction with public associations of the production sector.She is also Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (nominated by the largest political faction of the Congress - ""European People's Party / Christian Democrats""). She also leads the Russian delegation to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe.


== Criticism ==
The politician and businessman Mikhail Prokhorov accused Orlova of the fact that, at her request, Alexander Filippov, a competitor from the Civic Platform, was forcefully removed from the gubernatorial elections; a case was also initiated against Filippov's father. Prokhorov also believes that Orlova initiated the registration for the elections of Civic Position, a spoiler party similar in name and symbolism to Civic Platform, as well as the nomination of Filippov's namesake from this party.The Russian press, both federal and directly from the Vladimir Oblast, often criticized Orlova for a mass of election promises that she did not fulfill when she became governor. In particular, in 2013, Orlova stated that ""there will be no garbage from the Moscow region in the Vladimir region."" However, she subsequently supported the concept of building a waste processing plant in the Kirzhachsky district of the region, which was supposed to receive, among other things, waste from the housing renovation program operating in Moscow. This concept met with strong opposition from the residents of the area, ecologists and scientists.The media note Orlova's love for exaggerating her own merits: the governor rounds up and does it only in her favor. For example, she stated that 37 schools would be built by 2025, although only 24 were listed in the construction plan. Another time she reported that 4,000 residents were relocated from the emergency fund, in fact only 3382.Former Senator Konstantin Dobrynin wrote that “Orlova was known in the Federation Council as a 'flapper'. She always clapped a lot, furiously, but most importantly: she always started clapping first. The secret was simple: when the president did not have time to finish the thought, she already raised her elbows to chest level, spread her arms and began to clap her hands. Precisely to beat - do not clap. Sometimes accompanied by loud shouts of ""Bravo!"" Or ""Right!"" The most important thing was to get noticed. And the president noticed.""In one of her speeches, she lamented that ""America has not yet paid off the Lend-Lease.""


== Family ==
She is married, has a son and three grandchildren.Her husband, Viktor, in the past a sea captain, heads the NP ""Unipartnermarin"".Her son, Vladimi (born 1979), is a graduate of Moscow State University, who worked in the tax police, from 2003 to 2008, an employee of the Department of Economic Security of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, and a police captain. According to press reports, Vladimir, together with his colleagues in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was involved in the illegal confiscation of goods from entrepreneurs in the 2000s and their subsequent sale.

After the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Orlov worked as an advisor to the general director of the Olympstroy corporation, but resigned from it of his own free will.

== Career ==


=== Ukrainian service ===
After her graduation, Poklonskaya worked in the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office, initially serving as an assistant prosecutor to the Acting Prosecutor of the Republic of Crimea. She was the assistant attorney of Krasnogvardeisky district in Crimea from 2002 to 2006, and the assistant attorney of Yevpatoria from 2006 to 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, she was the deputy chief of a surveillance law enforcement unit of the Prosecutor's Office of Crimea which was responsible for dealing with organized crime.In 2011 in Simferopol, she acted as the state prosecutor in the high-profile trial of Ruvim Aronov, a former deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea and a former manager of the Saki soccer club. Aronov was prosecuted for his leadership role in the Bashmaki gang, an organized crime group that emerged in Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and Kyiv after the 1991 dissolution of the USSR. The gang had been ""known for its cruelty"" and had been implicated in racketeering, robberies, eight abductions, and 50 murders. In December of the same year, Poklonskaya was allegedly assaulted in the stairwell of her home in Yalta. As a result, she suffered partial facial paralysis. The alleged attack was widely believed to have been a revenge attack by the Bashmaki gang. On December 9, 2019, she reported that the information about the beating was not true, saying that “the story that someone beat me up at the entrance is not true.""
As a state prosecutor in the case of the Bashmaki gang, she was poisoned during a business trip to Odesa. Poklonskaya described the situation as follows: “I drank a bottle of ordinary water at the hotel when I was on a business trip in Odesa. There was an unknown substance in the water. At the hotel, there was water on the nightstand, as usual. It happened at night - nausea, intestinal and stomach upset. A wild headache, my head was splitting to such an extent that I wanted to die.” Subsequently, the unidentified substance was removed from the body; after the poisoning, Poklonskaya filed a report, telling the manager that she would no longer be able to work on this matter.In the same year, she was appointed the inter-district environmental prosecutor of Simferopol. Following that, she was transferred to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office in Kyiv, where she served as a senior prosecutor.From October to December 2012, Poklonskaya worked as head of the prosecution with the proceedings of the Court of Appeal of Crimea. Later, from December 2012 up until March 2014, she was a senior attorney of the 2nd division of the General Directorate of Internal Affairs involved in pre-trial investigation and public prosecution management supervision with oversight of law enforcement in criminal proceedings.On 25 February 2014, Poklonskaya handed in her resignation, in which she stated that she was ""ashamed to live in the country where neo-fascists freely walk about the streets"" (a reference to radical Euromaidan activists). The resignation was not accepted. Instead, she was given a vacation and left Kyiv for Crimea where her parents lived.


=== Prosecutor of Crimea ===
On 11 March 2014, amid the Russian occupation of Crimea, Poklonskaya was appointed Prosecutor of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Poklonskaya was appointed to the position by Sergei Aksyonov after the position had been reportedly rejected by four others, including the former Vice-Prosecutor of Crimea, Vyacheslav Pavlov. Her previous criticism of the opposition protests in Ukraine, and the ""anti-constitutional coup"" led the Ukrainian government to launch a criminal case against her and strip her of the civil service rank of Counsellor of Justice. For her part, Poklonskaya refers to the change of power in Ukraine as an ""unconstitutional coup and armed seizure of power"", and called Ukraine's new parliamentarians ""devils from the ashes.""Immediately following her appointment as Prosecutor, she was involved in an investigation into the violent attacks committed against Crimean Berkut members. On 19 March 2014, Poklonskaya confirmed that investigations were ongoing into a shooting in Simferopol which killed two while denying reports that the shooter had been detained. She compared the shooting to the ""sniper attacks on Independence Square in Kyiv"" from 18 to 21 February, and stated her belief that the shooting was meant to ""provoke violence between the military forces"" of Ukraine and Crimea.Crimea, which in the meantime had come under Russian control and become a federal subject of Russia (since then Crimea is under dispute by Russia and Ukraine), saw the creation of its new Prosecutor's Office, now subordinated to Russia's Prosecutor General Yury Chaika. On 25 March, Chaika appointed Poklonskaya as acting Prosecutor of the Republic of Crimea for this new office. Around the same time, Poklonskaya was listed as a wanted criminal on the website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, due to alleged involvement in conspiracy to overthrow constitutional order or seize state power. On 27 March, Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika granted Poklonskaya the rank of Senior Counsellor of Justice. On 4 April, Poklonskaya gave the approval for the Russian FSB to begin an operation to arrest Yevgeniy Pomelov, the assistant attorney of Yalta, as part of a larger bribery case.On 11 April, the Prosecutor General of Russia personally presented Poklonskaya with her official papers as a Russian legal officer. On 2 May, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Poklonskaya Chief Prosecutor of Crimea. On 4 May, Poklonskaya accused the Crimean Tatars' self-governmental body (the Mejlis) of extremist activity, warning that the Mejlis could be dissolved and outlawed across Russia.In June, Poklonskaya was appointed as a judge to ""guarantee impartiality in the selection of winners"" for Russia's Five Stars singing competition, which would select Russia's entrant for the Intervision Song Contest. In September, Poklonskaya declared that those who did not recognize the annexation of Crimea by Russia, as well as those who incited ethnic strife, would be deported. Also in November 2014, Poklonskaya was rated as the sixteenth out of the hundred most promising politicians in Russia by the Institute for Social-Economic and Political Studies.In March 2015, Poklonskaya was appointed as the head of the Japanese-Russian Friendship Society. In May 2015, Poklonskaya accused local activist Alexander Kostenko of making Nazi gestures during the Maidan protests, and that they were judging ""not just [Kostenko], but the very idea of fascism and Nazism, which are trying to raise their head once again"". Kostenko would later be sentenced to four years in a penal colony. On 11 June 2015, Putin granted Poklonskaya the rank of 3rd Class State Counsellor of Justice which corresponds with the military rank of Major General.Poklonskaya resigned as Prosecutor General on 27 September 2016 due to her election as MP in the State Duma during the 2016 Russian legislative election.Prior to her resignation, she was the youngest female general in Russia, at age 36.


=== Political career ===
In 2015, Poklonskaya announced that she would be running as an MP in the State Duma for the United Russia party. Poklonskaya was elected during the 2016 Russian legislative election. Throughout Russia, she was sometimes considered a potential candidate at the early stages of the presidential elections in 2018.In office, Poklonskaya became notable for her defense of early 20th century Tsar Nicholas II. Considered a Saint by the Russian Orthodox Church, Nicholas II was accused in the film Matilda of having an affair with Mathilde Kschessinska. Poklonskaya defended the Tsar and called on local prosecutors to determine whether the film was religiously insensitive. Poklonskaya was accused of being the head of an unofficial ""Orthodox Taliban"" by Deutsche Welle. Poklonskaya has argued that Nicholas II's abdication in 1917 was legally null and void.In 2018, Poklonskaya was the only United Russia MP to vote against a government bill to raise the retirement age. She did not stand for reelection in 2021.

On 13 October 2021, Poklonskaya was appointed ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to the Republic of Cabo Verde. She was, however, unable to take up that position, and was instead on 2 February 2022 appointed to be the deputy chief of Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation (commonly known as Rossotrudnichestvo) after completing a master's degree in international relations.In April 2022, the Moscow Times reported that Poklonskaya has labelled the Russia invasion of Ukraine as a ""catastrophe."" In a video address to an international forum she said, ""People are dying, houses and entire cities are destroyed leaving millions of refugees. Bodies and souls are mutilated. My heart is bursting with pain. My two native countries are killing each other, that's not what I wanted then and it's not what I want now."" Also in April 2022, she had told a popular YouTube blogger that Ukraine's society has ""changed"" in the eight years since the beginning of the war in Donbas with pro-Russian separatists and that Ukrainians ""would not greet Russia with flowers."" Later that month Poklonskaya also criticized the Z military symbol as used by the Russian invasion force. After doing this she received an immediate response from Rossotrudnichestvo head Yevgeny Primakov who claimed that the letters Z and V are ""symbols of the very liberation of Ukraine from the obvious evil of terrorists and bandits."" She also proposed investigating the events in Bucha as a war crime, called reports about US biological laboratories in Ukraine “fantasy” and stated that she did not consider Ukraine a Nazi state. According to the Moscow Times Poklonskaya's break with Russia's official line that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify and demilitarize"" Ukraine was practically unheard of for a sitting official.Amid her anti-war comments, Poklonskaya was dismissed as deputy chief of Rossotrudnichestvo on 13 June 2022. On her Telegram channel, Poklonskaya announced she would be ""moving to another job"" and thanked Putin for his ""support and trust."" She assumed her new position as adviser to Prosecutor General of Russia the following day.


== Internet popularity ==

After a video of Poklonskaya at a press conference on 11 March 2014 was uploaded to YouTube, she went viral among mainly Japanese and Chinese internet users, and also became the focus of attention of Internet communities such as Reddit, 4chan and VKontakte, which was reported by international news outlets. Within a month, the press conference was viewed over 1.7 million times. Many fan-created anime-style moe images of her uploaded to the Internet also attracted international media attention. A music video by YouTuber Enjoykin based on Poklonskaya's press conferences and interviews has had 48 million views on YouTube.In 2014, Poklonskaya was among the most searched-for ""celebrities"" on the Internet in both Russia and Ukraine. According to Google, she was the year's 7th most searched-for person in Russia and the 8th in Ukraine, and according to the Russian search engine Yandex – the 2nd most searched-for female in Ukraine and the 4th in Russia. She was described as a sex symbol by the New York Observer and Die Welt. Of the numerous cartoons of her appearing in Japanese newspapers, Poklonskaya said ""My daughter looks at these pictures every day. She happily tells me, 'Mom, you’re becoming an anime heroine in Japan,' which of course is very exciting for her. As for myself, though, I'm too busy to really pay much attention to the drawings.""
After being appointed advisor to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation in the summer of 2022, Poklonskaya completely stopped speaking on social networks - until October 2023. The reason to break the silence was an attempt by scammers to deceive an American citizen, who was informed that the ex-deputy had been extradited to Ukraine and was asked for 100 thousand dollars for a ransom. She reported this story on her Telegram channel.


== Personal life ==


=== Family ===
Due to the international media coverage she received in 2014, Poklonskaya has been intentionally reticent about her personal life. Although Russian media reported her as being married, when Poklonskaya failed to disclose her husband's name in her financial declarations, she was forced to admit that she had broken up with her fiancé, and had only stated she was married to prevent unwanted attention from male fans who may have wanted to date her. Poklonskaya has a daughter named Anastasiya (born 2005).On 13 August 2018, a number of media reported that Poklonskaya married 47-year-old Ivan Nikolaevich Soloviev, a veteran of law enforcement agencies, honoured lawyer of Russia, and head of the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia. The wedding took place in Crimea. A year later, in September 2019, Soloviev revealed that he and Poklonskaya had separated.


=== Other details ===
In the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, she voted for Viktor Yushchenko.
Poklonskaya said that since March 2014 she has not been a citizen of Ukraine. In April 2022 she referred to Russia and Ukraine as her ""two native countries"". Also in April 2022, she said Ukrainian society has ""changed"" in the eight years since the beginning of the war in Donbas with pro-Russian separatists and that ""Ukraine is not Russia"".Poklonskaya is deeply religious, and is a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. In March 2017, she claimed that a bronze bust of Tsar Nicholas II in Simferopol was seeping fragrant myrrh. The Russian Orthodox Church stated that they did not detect traces on the bronze bust, but instructed the church priest to continue observation; in the past some Roman Catholic worshippers had made claims of weeping statues of the Virgin Mary. Poklonskaya's statement drew ridicule from some Russian netizens.In February 2017, Poklonskaya led a campaign to block the release of the film Matilda for its allegedly blasphemous portrayal of the affair between Tsar Nicholas II (who has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church) and the ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. In April, she released a 39-page report attempting to denounce the film and alleging, among other claims, that the historically evidenced and well-documented affair could not have happened as Kshesinskaya was, in the opinion of the report's authors, ""too ugly to have attracted the attention of the Tsar"".On February 8, 2018, the Book World publishing house published Poklonskaya's book Devotion to Faith and Fatherland. At the beginning of 2019, she published an autobiographical book Crimean Spring: Before and After.In April 2019, she expressed admiration for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him ""a wonderful actor and politician"" and saying that she considers Zelenskyy ""a talented person"" and ""would be ready to vote for him.""Poklonskaya plays the piano. On her visit to the summer residence of Tsar Nicholas II, she played (among other pieces) Masquerade, a waltz by Soviet Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian.Poklonskaya told the website Novorossia Today in March 2016 that she views her beauty as an asset: ""My looks have never been an obstacle – I hope they deceive my enemies.""


==== Sanctions ====
Poklonskaya was sanctioned by the United Kingdom on 5 May 2014 in relation to ""actively implementing"" Russia's annexation of Crimea. On 12 May, the European Union added Poklonskaya to its sanctions list. This barred her from entering EU countries and any of her assets there, if existent, were to be frozen. Canada imposed similar sanctions on Poklonskaya a month later, followed by Japan on 4 August. Australia followed soon after, sanctioning Poklonskaya on 2 September. On 19 December, the United States introduced its individual sanctions against several Ukrainian separatists and Russians, of which Poklonskaya was the only woman.  In 2021, Ukraine added Poklonskaya to its sanctions list.
In an interview in 2020, Poklonskaya noted that despite visa sanctions, she travels abroad with a diplomatic passport.

41,"Irina Konstantinovna Rodnina (Russian: Ирина Константиновна Роднина, IPA: [ɪˈrʲinə kənstɐnˈtʲinəvnə rədʲnʲɪˈna]; born 12 September 1949) is a Russian politician and retired figure skater, who is the only pair skater to win 10 successive World Championships (1969–78) and three successive Olympic gold medals (1972, 1976, 1980). She was elected to the State Duma in the 2007 legislative election as a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. As a figure skater, she initially competed with Alexei Ulanov and later teamed up with Alexander Zaitsev. She is the first pair skater to win the Olympic title with two different partners, followed only by Artur Dmitriev.


== Figure skating career ==
In her pre-school years, Irina Rodnina suffered from pneumonia eleven times; deciding to enroll her in an activity, in 1954 her parents brought her to her first skating rink, in the Pryamikov Children Park in Moscow. Since the sixth form of secondary school, age 13, she trained at Children and Youth Sports School of CSKA on Leningradsky Prospekt.
By 1963, Rodnina had begun skating with her first partner Oleg Vlasov, coached by Sonia and Milan Valun. In 1964, her coach became Stanislav Zhuk, who paired her with Alexei Ulanov. They won four consecutive World and European titles. Rodnina/Ulanov won their first World title in 1969, ahead of Tamara Moskvina/Alexei Mishin.
Rodnina and Ulanov won their next two World titles, 1970 and 1971, ahead of silver medalists Lyudmila Smirnova/Andrei Suraikin. However, Ulanov fell in love with Smirnova, and prior to the 1972 Olympics, the couple made the decision to skate together the following season. Rodnina/Ulanov went on to compete at the 1972 Olympics where they captured the gold. They then prepared for their last competition together, the 1972 World Championships. While practicing together a day before the start of the competition, the pair had an accident on a lift and Rodnina ended up in hospital with a concussion and an intracranial hematoma. Despite the accident, they had a strong showing in the short program, receiving some 6.0s. In the long program, Rodnina became faint and dizzy but it was enough for their fourth World title. Ulanov continued his career with Smirnova, while Rodnina considered retirement.
In April 1972, her coach Stanislav Zhuk suggested she team up with the young Leningrad skater Alexander Zaitsev, who had good jumping technique and quickly learned the elements. Their music stopped during their short program at the 1973 World Championships, possibly due to a Czech worker acting in retaliation for the suppression of the Prague Spring. Known for intense concentration, they finished the program in silence, earning a standing ovation and a gold medal upon completion, ahead of Smirnova/Ulanov, whom they again defeated in 1974.
In 1974, Rodnina/Zaitsev left Zhuk, with whom the working relationship had become strained, to train with Tatiana Tarasova. They won six consecutive World titles together, as well as seven European gold medals, and won their first Olympic title together in 1976. Rodnina/Zaitsev did not compete during the 1978–79 season because she was pregnant with their son who was born on 23 February 1979. They returned in 1980 to capture their second Olympic title together and Rodnina's third. At the age of 30 years and 159 days, she became one of the oldest female figure skating Olympic champions. They then retired from competitive skating.
Throughout her career, Rodnina competed internationally for the Soviet Union and represented the Armed Forces sports society at the national level. Rodnina, along with Ulanov and her later partner Alexander Zaitsev ""completely dominated international pair skating throughout the 1970s"". With her partners, she won ten World Championships and three consecutive Olympic gold medals from 1971 to 1980, a record that equaled Sonia Henie's, along with eleven European titles, making her the most successful pair skater in history. She was one of the first female pair skaters to be known for her athleticism and ever-increasing dangerous tricks. She and her partners were also known for their acrobatic lifts, side-by-jumps, and for the split triple twist. In the early 1990s, she coached at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead, California.


=== Comments on Doping ===
In a 1991 interview, Rodnina said she was aware that Soviet figure skaters had used doping substances since the early 1970's in preparation for the competitive season. According to Rodina ""Boys in pairs and singles used drugs, but this was only in August or September. This was done just in training, and everyone was tested (in the Soviet Union) before competitions.""


== Political career ==
Rodnina became a member of the Public Chamber of Russia in 2005. In the 2007 legislative election, she was elected to the State Duma as a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. On 17 December 2012, Rodnina supported the Dima Yakovlev Law, the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the United States.

SanctionsSanctioned by the United Kingdom from 15 March 2022 in relation to Russia's actions in Ukraine.In December 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament sanctioned Rodnina for her support of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2023, she supported Poland's decision to boycott the Olympic Games in case Russian athletes are allowed to compete, saying that it would mean ""Poland gets banned for the next two Olympic cycles"".


== Personal life ==
Rodnina graduated from the Central Institute of Physical Culture. Her first marriage was to Alexander Zaitsev, with whom she has a son of the same name, born in 1979. From her second marriage with the film producer Leonid Menkovsky, Rodnina has a daughter, Alyona Minkovski, born in 1986. She is currently divorced. She spent a number of years living in the United States and then moved back to Russia.


=== Twitter controversy ===
On 13 September 2013, Rodnina caused a stir when she tweeted a doctored photo of U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, with Obama's mouth full of food, with a photoshopped banana in the image's foreground. She said she was practicing her right to free expression, but critics claimed she was making a racist comment about the African-American president. On 10 February 2014, Rodnina in her Twitter claimed that her account was hacked at the time of posting the offensive photograph and apologized for her handling of the affair.

46,"Svetlana Yevgenyevna Savitskaya (Russian: Светла́на Евге́ньевна Сави́цкая; born 8 August 1948) is a Russian former aviator and Soviet cosmonaut who flew aboard Soyuz T-7 in 1982, becoming the second woman in space. On her 1984 Soyuz T-12 mission she became the first woman to fly to space twice, and the first woman to perform a spacewalk.
She set several FAI world records as a pilot.


== Early life and early career ==
Svetlana Savitskaya was born in a privileged family.  Her father, Yevgeny Savitsky, was a highly decorated fighter pilot during the Second World War, which later brought him to the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Air Defense. Her mother was a Moscow Communist party leader.Without the knowledge of her parents, Savitskaya began parachuting at the age of 16. Her father realized her unknown extracurricular activity upon the discovery of a parachute knife in his daughter's school bag. After his discovery, he further promoted this tendency.  On her seventeenth birthday she already had 450 parachute jumps.  Over the next year, she led record stratosphere jumps from 13,800 m and 14,250 m. Over the course of her flying experience, Savitskaya achieved three world record jumps from the stratosphere and 15 world record jumps from jet planes.After graduating in 1966, she enrolled in the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI), where she also took flight lessons.  In 1971 she was licensed as a flight instructor.  After graduating from the MAI in 1972, she trained as a test pilot at the Fedotov Test Pilot School, graduating in 1976. In May 1978 she went to work for the aircraft manufacturer Yakovlev, as a test pilot. In her flight experience, she became the first woman to reach 2,683 km/h in a MiG-25 aircraft. An experienced and highly educated female in the Soviet Space Program, Savitskaya was reportedly an extremely serious, unbending, and steely woman. While she and Valentina Tereshkova were both chosen for missions into space due to Soviet propaganda purposes, Savitskaya was much more trained and experienced in aeronautics whereas Tereshkova was chosen as a political stunt.Between 1969 and 1977 she was a member of the Soviet national team for aerobatics.  At the FAI World Aerobatic Championships in July 1970 at Hullavington, she flew a Yak-18 and won the world championship together with an all-female team. At this particular Championship in the United Kingdom, a journalist for the British Press nicknamed Savitskaya “Miss Sensation”. At the 1972 World Championships in Salon-de-Provence she placed third; in 1976 in Kiev with a Yak-50, fifth.


== Soviet space program ==
In 1979, Savitskaya participated in the selection process for the second group of female cosmonauts.  On June 30, 1980, she was officially admitted to the cosmonaut group. Of the nine women selected, Savitskaya was the only test pilot. The groups’ training was announced during French Air force officer and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien’s space mission. She passed her exams on February 24, 1982.


=== First flight: Soyuz T-7 / T-5 ===
In December 1981, Savitskaya prepared for her first space flight, a short-term flight to the space station Salyut 7. She held the position of research cosmonaut on this mission. The mission of this second visiting expedition of the Salyut 7 was to prove the Soviet superiority to America by flying another woman into space and to replace the Soyuz T-5 spacecraft the crew would use for their return with a new vehicle.The commander of this mission was Leonid Popov, with his third flight; it was flight engineer Alexander Serebrov's first flight.
The launch of Soyuz T-7 took place on August 19, 1982. This made Savitskaya the second woman in space, 19 years after Valentina Tereshkova. During the journey, Savitskaya claimed to have tied herself down to prevent from being carried into another compartment of the craft due to the loss of gravity. The three cosmonauts docked with the space station the following day, where they were welcomed by Anatoly Berezovoy and Valentin Lebedev.  This was the first time a space station had a mixed gender crew.  Savitskaya was assigned the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 as a private area, but slept as well as the men in the space station.  On August 27, 1982, Popov, Savitskaya, and Serebrov returned to Earth in Soyuz T-5. The total duration of the mission was 7 days, 21 hours, and 52 minutes.In 1995, Savitskaya gave an interview to Baltimore Sun journalist Clara Germani. She recalled encountering some sexism from her male crewmates and that upon entering Salyut 7 for the first time, Valentin Lebedev presented her with an apron and told her ""to get to work"". She stated that ""I was quickly able to establish a working, professional relationship with them.""


=== Second flight: Soyuz T-12 ===
In December 1983 she was assigned to her second flight, including an extravehicular activity, or EVA, three weeks after American astronaut Kathy Sullivan's flight and EVA assignment were made public. The timing of her mission would become one of her last triumphs to further the Soviet propaganda agenda in performing the first woman's space walk before the Americans. Savitskaya was chosen above other female cosmonauts due to the extensive flight experience and physical ability to perform the necessary operations in a heavy, bulky space suit for multiple hours. Savitskaya participated in this mission under the title of flight engineer.Again, it was to be a short-term mission to Salyut 7, this time bringing tools to the station so that the third resident crew, the Salyut 7 EO-3, could repair a fuel line.
On July 17, 1984, Savitskaya launched aboard Soyuz T-12, together with Commander Vladimir Dzhanibekov and research cosmonaut Igor Volk.  On July 25, 1984, Savitskaya became the first woman to spacewalk, conducting EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes, during which she cut and welded metals in space along with her colleague Vladimir Dzhanibekov. The importance of their mission was to test the Universal Hand Tool or Universalny Rabochy Instrument (URI). This tool created at the Paton Institute in Kiev, Ukraine could be used to cut, solder, weld, and braze in space. During the EVA, Savitskaya performed a total of 6 cuts of titanium and stainless steel, 2 coatings of anodized aluminum, 6 tests of tin and lead solder, and test cuts of a 0.5 mm titanium sample. Of the 57 Soviet/Russian spacewalkers through 2010, she is the only woman, and as of April 2020 is still the only Soviet/Russian woman to walk in space. The return to Earth took place on July 29, 1984.
Savitskaya recalled that, during her second mission, she expressed concern about the extravehicular welding exercises, as ""I did not understand the point of it. We might burn our spacesuits or the exterior of the station."" but her overall excellent performance on both flights silenced critics who questioned a woman's capability to perform space missions. Savitskaya's and Dzhanibekov's training and tests allowed for Dzhanibekov to direct two members of the Salyut 7 crew, Kizim and Solovyov, who had performed multiple EVA's to repair the ship, in the techniques to operate the URI in order to fully repair the fuel line. The total duration of their mission lasted 11 days, 19 hours, and 14 minutes.


=== Possible third spaceflight ===
Upon returning to Earth, Savitskaya was assigned as the commander of an all-female Soyuz crew to Salyut 7 in commemoration of International Women's Day. She was chosen for this duty because she was the only experienced female cosmonaut still on active duty at the time. She was set to command Yekaterina Ivanova and Yelena Dobrokvashina, two younger female cosmonauts. In February 1985, however, the radio contact with Salyut 7 was lost; the space station was rescued by the Soyuz T-13 mission in the summer of 1985.  When the next mission had to be stopped in November 1985, due to an illness of the commander Vladimir Vasyutin, the women's flight was finally canceled.  In addition, after two unsuccessful flights in 1983, Soyuz T-8 and Soyuz T-10-1, not enough Soyuz spacecraft were available.  Later it would have been possible to fly with a Soyuz-TM to the space station Mir.  However, this plan was not pursued due to Savitskaya's pregnancy and birth of her son in 1986.


== Biography ==
Savitskaya is married, with one child, a son Konstantin born in October 1986.  In February 1986, she graduated from the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School.  From 1983 to 1994 Savitskaya held a position of Deputy Head of NPO Energia.A committed communist, Savitskaya was elected as a people's deputy of the USSR from 1989 and a people's deputy of Russia in 1990, a position she held until 1992. She did not welcome the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, noting that everything her parents had worked hard to build was destroyed almost overnight and she was ""glad they did not live to see it"".Savitskaya retired in 1993 from the Russian Air Force with the rank of Major.  In 1994/95 she worked as an assistant professor in Economics and Investment at the Moscow State Aviation Institute.  In 1996, she was elected a deputy of the State Duma representing the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and has been re-elected four times since then. She presently serves as Deputy Chair of the Committee on Defence, and is also a member of the Coordination council presidium of the National Patriotic Union.

47,"Maria Sergeyeva is a Russian political activist.


== Personal life ==
Sergeyeva was born on September, 10th 1985 into a working-class family.  Her father was a metal worker and her mother an accountant.  Formerly a member of the Democratic Party of Russia, she left the party because of its support for Russia's inclusion in the European Union.  In 2006, she joined the United Russia Young Guard,. She continues to keep the public apprised of her political thoughts through her LiveJournal blog.  She also posts about her personal life there, including provocative and candid photographs with such captions as, ""I'm at a conference, drunk,"" in describing one picture.Sergeyeva is a philosophy student and a political activist identified with Russia's right-wing political movement.  She is a nationalist and has said, ""I was brought up to be a patriot from day one.  My love for Russia came with my mother's milk. I loved listening to my grandparents' heroic tales from the war.
[Vladimir] Putin has given us stability and economic growth. It's good that he's hardline and tough.""


== Political activism ==
After she delivered a speech in early 2009 praising Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, her popularity became such that Russia's largest political blog had to remove references to ""Masha"" (short name for Maria in Russian) due to excessive bandwidth use.  Sergeyeva's physical attractiveness has been noted by several media outlets as a possible catalyst to her political popularity, and she sometimes comments on what she perceives as her political opponents' lack of physical attractiveness in some of her political commentary.


== Political beliefs ==
Sergeyeva holds to nationalist, right-wing philosophies such as opposition to illegal immigration, support for Russian manufacturers, and distrust of intervention by the United States in Eastern European affairs.  Her ambition is to become an MP and eventually a minister.
In breaking with traditional right-wing politics, she has become more pro-environment, stating, ""Before I found out a rubbish burning plant was going to be built right underneath my window, I did not think about ecological issues at all. I understood that Moscow has a large population, many cars, and therefore a lot of pollution, but the problem, just like for most Russians, did not hit close to home. After it sunk in that I was going to have to breathe in filthy air, I began reading a lot about the issue.""


== Criticism ==
Despite her reputation as a Russian nationalist, she considers herself a fan of Margaret Thatcher, Winston Churchill, and others she describes as ""independent thinkers"".  At the same time, she has also called Catherine the Great ""a great leader"".

55,"Elena Borisovna Skrynnik (Russian: Елена Борисовна Скрынник; maiden name Novitskaya) (born 30 August 1961) is a Russian politician. She served as the first female minister of agriculture of the Russian Federation between March 2009 and May 2012.


== Early life ==
Skrynnik was born on 30 August 1961 in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Her father was a mining engineer. In 1986, she graduated from Chelyabinsk Medical Academy.In 1992, Skrynnik graduated from the State Academy of Agriculture of the Russian Federation and interned in Germany and France in the field of leasing technologies.


== Career ==
Skrynnik worked at the Chelyabinsk Polytechnical Institute clinic and later as deputy chief surgeon of Chelyabinsk Metallurgy Enterprise clinic. She continued her medical career in cardiology at a regional clinic.In 1994, she founded an Inter-regional medical leasing company named Medleasing. She acquired the sobriquet ""Madam Leasing"" and was accused of money laundering. The inspection and audit of the accounting chamber did not confirm these allegations. As a result, the article was perceived by experts as an attempt to slow down the development of the leasing industry in Russia by attacking her as the Russian specialist in this field.In 1998, she was given an international award for best leasing project. In 1997, she assumed the chair of the Russian Association of Leasing Companies and in 1998 she became the chairwoman of Experts Council for Leasing.In 1999, the Russian Biography Institute declared her Person of the Year in economics and entrepreneurship. In 2000, she became a board member of the Union of Russian Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs. 
In 2002, she became the general director of state-run company Rosagroleasing. According to Kommersant, Rosagroleasing under her guidance had significantly higher turnover and greater transparency versus the leadership of Valery Nazarov.In November 2008, she was elected to the Supreme Council of Russian political party United Russia. On 12 March 2009, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin appointed Skrynnik minister of agriculture. Her tenure ended in 2012 when she was removed from office due to her alleged involvement in nepotism and illegal activities. Skrynnik was not included in the new Russian government in 2012, while on maternity leave. Allegations of possible corruption connections were refuted by the report of the Accounting Chamber, according to which the lessees debt in 2008 amounted to 1 billion rubles and not 39 billion rubles, as the media claimed. 
The corruption component was not supported by the auditors of Accounting Chamber. In an interview with TASS Skrynnik announced her intention to sue the journalists. According to some analysts, an inquiry of her activities can be explained as an intra-elite struggle presented under the guise of a fight against corruption. Skrynnik, heading the state-owned company, was not a government official and was not governed by civil service, so she did not commit any violations.It is possible that problems could appear because of Skrynnik's disagreements with Viktor Zubkov. Skrynnik could face administration friction with the first vice-premier of agriculture, since he wanted to manage all agricultural policy matters. ""Zubkov was meant to respond hard to violations of Rosagroleasing in any case,- said Yevgeny Minchenko from the Institute of Political Expertise: ""To turn away a blow, as he led the company's board of directors"".On 18 February 2016 a TV program Moment of Truth came on Channel 5, stating that the charges in the address of Skrynnik were a frame-up. Author and presenter Andrew Karaulov analyzed her activity as a Minister of Agriculture, and concluded that the cause of the incident was her decision to drastically reduce imports of ""Bush legs"" to the Russian market. Another reason was the successful implementation of the program of import substitution, promoted by Skrynnik signed by Putin. In an attempt to discredit Skrynnik, the film accused the largest producers of chicken meat in the United States.Criminal cases were not opened against her.In October 2015, the Swiss Federal attorney opened a criminal investigation against Skrynnik on suspicion of money laundering and ordered her bank accounts frozen. It soon became clear that the reports were false. Skrynnik and the seizure of her accounts are not mentioned in the request to the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation for legal assistance in a criminal case in Switzerland in relation to Russian defendants. Sergei Ivanov, the presidential chief of staff of Russian Federation, said: ""As far as I know, the General Prosecutor of Switzerland has no claims specifically to Elena Skrynnik. There are claims, and significant ones, in relation to her deputy, who previously worked in ""Rosagroleasing."" In his opinion, we should not pay attention to the publications in media on that. ""Do not read Soviet newspapers"".Some Russian media incorrectly  reported that she was expelled from United Russia. Sergey Neverov, the ex-Secretary of United Russia General Council  said, ""The information about her expulsion is not consistent with the reality"".Skrynnik was a Candidate of Sciences in economics since 2010. On 24 December 2014 she was stripped of her degree because her thesis was plagiarised.


=== Minister of Agriculture ===
From 12 March 2009 to 21 May 2012 she served as Minister of Agriculture. Her activities in agriculture were noted by Boris Gryzlov, Chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation: ""Elena Skrynnik ... made a great contribution to the development of agricultural support mechanisms. During regional business trips, I often visit farm units ... and I know how leasing programs are in demand for agricultural production.""In May 2009 Skrynnik established a state-owned company for the supply of fuel, oil and lubricants at preferential prices for rural areas. The Ministry later established a system of uninterrupted supply of fuel, oil and lubricants for rural equipment and technology on preferential terms. In 2011 the Russian government decided to end sugar imports, as for the preceding two years domestic sugar beet production was sufficient. In the same year, Russia began exporting sugar for the first time ever.Under Skrynnik's leadership Russia began providing itself with the main categories of agricultural products. The Ministry started active cooperation with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service. On 1 January 2010 the directive of a Chief State Medical Officer came into effect in Russia that banned selling chicken disinfected with high-concentration chlorine compounds. Skrynnik was seen as one of the initiators of this ban. In 2010 Skrynnik began carrying out a policy of import substitution, reducing poultry imports and increasing exports of Russian meat. Skrynnik also banned import of milk powder to Russia from Belarus.Following the 2010 drought, in August 2010 the Ministry resumed the work of the Federal Commission to restructure debts of agricultural companies. The commission's task was to prevent bankruptcies due to drought. Skrynnik increased lending in 2011 to restore agricultural production. Locust plagues across Russia disrupted production in 2011. Skrynnik supported initiative of creating special mobile units to control the pests.


== Controversies ==
In November 2012, VGTRK published an investigation about Skrynnik stating that during her ministership of agriculture, the ministry allegedly allocated money from its budget to improve housing conditions of employees but eventually spent the funds on purchasing mansions in the Rublyovka area.

The list was based on women's fortune and celebrity status. She is known across Russia as a socialite, TV host and presenter. Sobchak was Russia's No.1 ""it girl"", an analogue to Paris Hilton.


== Political background and activities ==


=== Background ===
Sobchak's father, Anatoly, had been both Vladimir Putin's and Dmitry Medvedev's law professor at Leningrad State University. He built a close relationship with Putin, in particular, and in 1991 Anatoly helped launch Putin's career in politics when he was the mayor of Saint Petersburg. Putin then helped Anatoly flee Russia when he was wanted on corruption charges. According to the Moscow News, ""Putin's reported affection for the Sobchak family is widely believed to give Ksenia Sobchak a protected status, which may also explain her boldness"", such as her encounter in October 2011 with Vasily Yakemenko, the controversial leader of the pro-Kremlin Nashi youth movement, when she reprimanded him for eating at an expensive restaurant in Moscow and published a video of the encounter on the internet.


=== ""Everyone is Free!"" ===
At the end of March 2006, Sobchak rented a two-story mansion at 16 Arbat Street and convened a press conference to announce the creation of the youth movement ""Everyone is Free!"" According to the TV presenter, she was prompted to take this step by numerous letters in which fans of her work in Dom-2 shared their problems and experiences. Sobchak felt that political positions and opposition served only as a pretext for realizing her ambitions and declared her movement non-political, aimed at providing help and support to young people. Sobchak promised to provide funding for ""Everyone is Free!"" from her personal funds. The rented building on Arbat was hastily renovated and decorated in the movement's ""signature"" color of blue denim; it housed the movement's headquarters and a reception area for those wishing to join. The Izvestia newspaper conducted an online survey in which, after the press conference, users were asked about their desire to join Sobchak's movement. The results showed a lack of enthusiasm: of 2,133 respondents, only 6% expressed a desire to join for political reasons or sympathy for the leader, and 38% admitted that they did not know who Ksenia Sobchak was. After the first press conference, Sobchak stopped communicating with journalists for a month. On 7 July, she avoided participating in a debate with the leader of the youth branch of the Rodina party, Sergey Shargunov, at the Club on Brestskaya, which caused dissatisfaction among the youth politicians and journalists who attended the event.On 12 June, ""Everyone is Free!"" declared itself with a street action dedicated to improving the square around the monument to Sergei Yesenin on Tverskoy Boulevard. Participants in the movement collected garbage, painted benches and playgrounds on the boulevard, and Sobchak herself, in the presence of journalists and onlookers, wiped off a yellow bikini with a red heart drawn by an unknown vandal from the crotch of the Yesenin monument. According to local residents, on the morning of that day, there was no paint on the monument, and it appeared only before the event. The action ended with a small concert and fashion show on a stage near the monument. In early July, a ""club day"" was held at the movement's headquarters. Sobchak made policy statements and issued club cards to the most active participants, providing free access to nightclubs, discounts, and other privileges. During the meeting, Sobchak presented a presentation on the goals and moral guidelines of the movement, in which two slides were occupied by the declared sponsors: Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Russian Standard Bank, the Renaissance Capital investment bank, Lukoil, MegaFon, the Bilingua cafe-club, and other companies. ""Club day"" ended with a debate between writers Oksana Robski and Sergey Minaev.At first, the movement was the cause of gossip in the political environment: experts and young politicians tried to understand Sobchak's motivations. Political scientist and contemporary art collector Marat Gelman suggested that Sobchak could have set her sights on a political career in United Russia and was gathering her supporters ahead of the 2007 Russian legislative election. The head of Yabloko Youth, Ilya Yashin, doubted Sobchak's independence and shared with journalists his opinion that ""Everyone is Free!"" could have been created to criticize the opposition with the approval of the Presidential Administration. The leader of the pro-Kremlin Nashi movement, Vasily Yakemenko, doubted the Kremlin's involvement in the creation of the ""Everyone is Free!"" movement: in his opinion, Sobchak could both be useful to the Presidential Administration and discredit the Russian authorities. Subsequently, the movement ceased any activity, and journalists mentioned Sobchak as the head of ""Everyone is Free!"" only once - in the context of discussing the elections to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg of the fourth convocation, which it considered fictitious, and the construction of the Okhta Center skyscraper for Gazprom on the right bank of the Neva opposite the Smolny Cathedral.


=== Russian presidential election, 2018 ===

In September 2017, prior to her announcement to run, Putin said of Sobchak's presidential intentions to a press conference at the 9th BRICS summit, that ""Every person has the right to nominate himself in accordance with the law. And Ksenia Sobchak is not an exception here. I respect her father Anatoly Sobchak, I believe that he was an outstanding figure in contemporary Russian history. I'm saying this without a trace of irony. He was very decent, played a big role in my own destiny. But when it comes to running for presidency, things of a personal nature cannot play any significant role. It depends on what program she's offering, if she'll actually run, and how she'll build her presidential campaign"".Sobchak declared her candidacy in the Russian presidential election 2018 on 18 October 2017. Prior to the announcement of her intention to enter the Presidential race in 2018, Sobchak discussed her intention personally with Putin. She said: ""With Vladimir Vladimirovich, my family has been associated with a great deal... so I felt it right to say that I made such a decision"". Putin, she said, told her that ""every person has the right to make their own decisions and must be responsible for them"".Sobchak was the Civic Initiative's candidate for the 2018 Russian presidential election.Some skeptics accused Sobchak of being a spoiler to undermine Alexei Navalny; every recent election for the presidency has featured a prominent liberal candidate handpicked by the Kremlin. Other skeptics suspect Sobchak's candidacy is mostly about building her brand. Sobchak did not believe she could win against Putin in 2018, but has stated she's in it for the long haul: ""Of course I want to be president, I want to win, but I also want to be sincere. In a system created by Putin, it is only possible for Putin to win. I am realistic about who will become the president.""On 15 March 2018, Sobchak and Dmitry Gudkov announced the creation of a new party, called the Party of Changes on the basis of the party Civic Initiative. The aim was of party was to ""return our freedom and your freedom"". Sobchak won 1.68% of the vote in the 2018 presidential election.


=== Flight from Russia ===
On 26 October 2022, Russian media reported that Sobchak would be detained as part of an investigation into the alleged extortion of 11 million rubles from the head of Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, by Sobchak's  director Kirill Sukhanov. Lithuanian authorities confirmed that Sobchak had entered Lithuania and was entitled to stay for 90 days without a visa because she was an Israeli citizen. The raid came after the arrest of Kirill Sukhanov, a commercial director at Sobchak's media group, ""Ostorozhno, Media"", for alleged extortion, with Sobchak reportedly being a suspect in the case. Lithuanian border officials said that Sobchak had arrived on an Israeli passport, while Sobchak called the case an attack on her editorial team. Then, days after she fled the country, she returned to Russia, according to state media.


== Political views ==
In 2012, Sobchak was critical of Putin's political policies. Although she stated that she had ""happily"" voted for Putin when she was younger, she would not do so any longer. In the 2012 Russian presidential election, Sobchak says she voted for Mikhail Prokhorov.After the parliament elections held on 4 December 2011, which are known for the large number of alleged fraud reports, Sobchak joined the protest rallies held in Russia as a response to the alleged electoral frauds. She also took part in the campaign against Putin's re-election, working as an observer during the president elections held on 4 March 2012. She was one of the Russian protest participants targeted by the Investigative Committee of Russia on 12 June 2012, when her apartment in Moscow was entered and searched.


=== Economic views ===
Outlining her economic views, she writes:

Russia is a country of a free economy with a strong state sector. All large state corporations should be privatized with antitrust restrictions. The state should not control any sectors of the economy, the state's share in enterprises and industries should be limited to breaking up monopolies. Private property should be protected by law, the review of any ownership and nationalization are possible only on a reimbursable basis on the basis of independent market valuations. Reform of tax and regulatory legislation and practices should stimulate the development of private entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized businesses, technological and innovative development of enterprises, education. The list of licensed branches of the economy should be significantly reduced.


=== Views on feminism ===
In her 2017 manifesto, she criticised the lack of women's representation in industry and politics.

Almost 500 heavy professions in Russia are officially closed to women. But among all the others – the salary of a woman is almost 30% less than that of a man. Among the most important companies in the country, women head only about 5%. ... In any case, half the country's population deserves a female voice for the first time in 14 years in these allegedly male games.


=== On the status of Crimea ===
Ksenia Sobchak is of the opinion that, having annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum; she claimed on 24 October 2017 that ""Under these agreements, we agreed that Crimea is Ukrainian, which is the most important for me"". Sobchak stressed that she did not consider the issue with Crimea resolved. ""I believe that these things need to be discussed, it is very important to discuss them ... look for some ways out."" She also added that ""the most important thing that Russia and Ukraine should do now is to restore our friendship at any cost."" Simultaneously she suggested to hold a new referendum on the status of Crimea after ""a broad and equal campaign."" In December 2017, Sobchak claimed that an unconditional withdrawal of Russia from Crimea would lead to a civil war in Russia.


=== Other views ===
Sobchak has said that if she becomes president, she will remove the body of Vladimir Lenin from Red Square, since, in her opinion, this is an indicator of a ""medieval way of life in the country... so the corpse of Lenin must be removed from Red Square.""In her interview discussion with Julia Volkova in 2021 Sobchak voiced her support for LGBT rights in Russia, stating that she disagrees with the country's controversial ""gay propaganda law"". On 24 February 2022 Sobchak voiced opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, writing that ""We the Russians will be dealing with the consequences of today for many more years"".


== Personal life ==
On 1 February 2013 Sobchak married Maksim Emmanuilovich Vitorgan (born 10 September 1972 in Moscow, RSFSR, USSR). He is an actor, known for Möbius (2013), Bite the Dust (2013) and Dreamfish (2016).

They arrived to their wedding ceremony in a hearse.In 2015 Sobchak said that if there was ever the possibility of political persecution against her, she had thought about emigration or getting an Israeli passport, but would prefer the United States where she could find a Russian-speaking community:
I'm a very big patriot. I really love my job, the city, my friends. And if tomorrow is war, then the place for emigration will have to be a Russian-speaking place. I have to work in Russian.
In April 2022 she received Israeli citizenship.On 15 July 2023, TASS said that seven people were arrested in a connection with a plot to kill Sobchak and Margarita Simonyan, the chief editor of RT.
