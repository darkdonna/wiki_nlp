1,"Mary Lou Jepsen (born 1965) is a technical executive and inventor in the fields of display, imaging, and computer hardware. She was the co-founder and first chief technology officer of One Laptop per Child (OLPC), and later founded Pixel Qi in Taipei, Taiwan, focused on the design and manufacture of displays. She founded and led two moonshots at Google X, and was an executive at Facebook / Oculus VR, leading an effort to advance virtual reality.
Her contributions have had adoption in head-mounted displays, HDTV, laptop computers, and projector products. She contributed to low-cost computing and innovative consumer and medical imaging technologies. Time Magazine named her in their list of the hundred most influential scientists and thinkers in the world (The 2008 TIME 100). CNN named her as one of their 2013 top 10 thinkers in science and technology for her work in display innovation. She has over 200 patents published or issued.
In 2016 she founded OpenWater, a startup working on fMRI-type imaging of the body using holographic, infrared techniques.


== Early life and education ==
Jepsen studied Studio Art and Electrical Engineering at Brown University. She received a Master of Science in Holography from the MIT Media Lab, and then returned to Brown to receive a Ph.D. in Optical Sciences.


== Career ==
Her PhD work combined theoretical coupled-wave analysis with lab work, in which she created large-scale, embossed surface-relief diffraction gratings with liquid crystal-filled grooves with high diffraction efficiency in un-polarized illumination.She has created some of the largest ambient displays ever. In Cologne, Germany she built a holographic replica of pre-existing buildings in the city's historic district and created a holographic display encompassing a city block. She also demonstrated that it was technically feasible – but agreed it was culturally unacceptable – to project TV images on the moon's surface.From 2003 until the end of 2004, she was the chief technology officer of Intel’s Display Division. In 2016 she joined the board of directors of Lear Corporation, a leading maker of automotive electronics and seating.


=== MIT Media Lab and OLPC ===
In 2005 Jepsen joined the faculty of the MIT Media Lab as a professor with a tenure-track position. Here she started the Nomadic Displays Group, and co-created the first holographic video system in the world in 1989, where the interference structure of the hologram was computed at video rates, and shown on her hand-made display. This system inspired a new subfield of holographic video and received numerous awards.Working with Nicholas Negroponte, she simultaneously co-founded One Laptop per Child, a $100 computer, the lowest-power laptop ever made. As of 2013, millions of units have shipped to children in the developing world and revenues are beyond the billion dollar mark. There are deployments in over 50 countries and in more than 25 different languages. For the entire first year of the effort (2005) she was the only employee of One Laptop per Child [OLPC]. By the end of 2005, she had completed the initial architecture, led the development of the first prototype, and signed up some of the world's largest manufacturers to produce the XO-1. By the end of 2007 she had led the laptop through development and into high volume mass production. At OLPC, Jepsen invented the laptop's sunlight-readable display technology and co-invented its ultra-low power management system, and transformed these inventions into high volume mass production.


=== Pixel Qi ===

In 2008, Jepsen started a for-profit company, Pixel Qi, to commercialize some of the technologies she invented at OLPC. The firm's business was based on the concept that the screen is the most critical component of any mobile device. It aimed to deliver high performance, low-power, sunlight-readable screens for mobile devices. The long-term vision of Pixel Qi was to create devices that never needed to be recharged by lowering the power consumption and using alternative power generation and battery technologies. Its screens became available in a few dozen commercial and specialized products with sunlight readability, and reduced screen power consumption (which typically accounts for about 90% of the power draw in a tablet, and 70% of the power draw on a standard cell phone.


=== Google X and virtual reality ===
Jepsen joined Google X in 2013. She advised and directed display and consumer electronic programs throughout Google. The Wall Street Journal reported that among her projects there she created Google Lego TV: displays composed of smaller screens that plug together like Legos to create vast, seamless images and ""live walls"" for wall size interaction, television, video conferencing and gaming, to virtual reality without having to wear anything on your face or body. She was also one of the first contributors in Google's ""Solve for X"" projects with her idea of ""Imaging the Mind's Eye"".In February 2015, she joined Facebook as an executive for virtual reality.


=== Openwater ===
In 2016, she left Facebook and founded Openwater, a firm aiming to use infrared holography to make fMRI-type imaging inside the body practical, at the price level of consumer electronics and in wearable form factors. She gave a talk at 2018 TED on the technology behind the Openwater approach. At the IGNITION 2018 Conference, Jepsen further discussed the resolution progression of Openwater's MRI machines and the potential for the technology to make advancements in telepathy by allowing users to transmit thoughts and feelings electronically.In a 2020 online call, Mary Lou mentioned that openwater devices are actively in the rapid prototyping phase with alpha kits expected August 2020. The Openwater website stated in 2020: ""We are starting hospital studies on humans for use as a stroke detector at the end of 2020.""As of 2020, the final devices were slated to come out sometime in 2021, but this has been revised to 2024 in an FAQ written in January 2024.In an open ""Founder's Letter"" in January 2024, Dr. Mary Lou Jepsen announced having raised ""$54 million in the past several months"" to create an AGPL-licensed open source platform for enabling other organisations to slash the cost of disease treatment.


== Awards and recognitions ==

6,"Lynda Marie Jordan (born 20 September 1956) is an American biochemist, ordained minister, and CEO & founder of A Place to Heal Ministries, Inc. (APTHM). She was the third Black woman to receive a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was a Ford Fellow at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, an associate professor of chemistry at North Carolina A&T State University, and the first woman to be invited to the MLK Visiting Professor program at MIT. Jordan was also the first person at Harvard University to complete a Master of Public Health and Master of Divinity simultaneously.


== Early life and education ==
Jordan was born at Boston City Hospital, Roxbury, Boston in 1956 to Charles Thessel Jordan, a meat cutter, and Charlene Veasley Jordan, a homemaker. Jordan was the oldest of the couple's three daughters, and when her parents divorced, Jordan assisted her mother with finances, child care and other adult responsibilities in the household despite her young age. The family moved into the Bromley-Heath Housing Project, where, like the Jordans, 85% of the households depended on welfare to survive.When Jordan was 11, her mother remarried, and Jordan, her sisters and her mother moved to Dorchester with their new stepfather and his 12 children. Jordan got ""lost in the shuffle""and began hanging out on the streets. During this time, while evading a teacher at Dorchester High School who had caught her smoking in the gym locker room, Jordan took cover in the audience of an invite-only Upward Bound presentation in progress in the school auditorium. She describes hearing the speaker, Joseph Warren, ask the assembled group ""What are you going to do with your life - hang out on the street corner?"" Jordan was struck that he seemed to know her situation. She approached the speaker, expressed interest in the program, applied, and was accepted.Halfway through her first summer in Upward Bound, which followed her sophomore year and was hosted at Brandeis University, Jordan was recognized as one of the six most improved of the 100 participants. She recalls this recognition as a key moment when she realized her academic potential, and she returned to Upward Bound for the following two summers. During her second summer there, Jordan completed the science curriculum before finishing the program, and Warren hired a private tutor to teach her organic chemistry.Jordan graduated from high school in 1974. Encouraged by Warren, an alumnus, Jordan entered North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University as a nursing major but switched to chemistry. She was the president of the Beta Kappa Chi honor society and a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. After attending the Harvard Health Careers summer program, Jordan became increasingly interested in biochemistry. She graduated from North Carolina A&T in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, becoming the first person in her family to graduate from college.Jordan continued to Atlanta University (AU) where she conducted research at Morehouse School of Medicine and graduated with a Master of Science in biochemistry in December 1980. As part of the graduate program at AU, Jordan regularly took the Graduate Record Examination, performed exceptionally well, and was recruited by MIT to complete a Ph.D. in biological chemistry.Before beginning her MIT program, Jordan interned at the Polaroid Corporation during the summer of 1981, beginning her Ph.D. in the fall. At the time, the Ph.D. program was composed mainly of men, and only 3% of the students were Black. Jordan co-chaired the Black Graduate Student Association while at MIT, and in 1985 she became only the third Black woman ever to receive a Ph.D. from MIT.


== Career and research ==
Jordan completed her postdoctoral research as a Ford Fellow at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, also receiving fellowships from the French Institute of Health and Medical Research and Chateaubriand. She worked under Françoise Russo-Marie, who had been studying lipocortin, the protein inhibitor of the phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) enzyme, in non-human sources. Jordan successfully isolated the PLA-2 from human placentas, contributing to ongoing research goals of isolating and treating the underlying causes of PLA-2 diseases such as asthma, arthritis and pre-term labor.Jordan returned to North Carolina A&T in 1987 as an assistant professor of chemistry. She began improving and developing the biochemistry lab there; continued her work with PLA-2; presented her research alongside her students at various conferences in the United States, Switzerland, Japan and Australia; and received national and international recognition for her teaching and support for under-represented groups.In 1997, Jordan was the first woman to be invited to MLK visiting professor program at MIT, and served in that position until 2000. She completed both a Master of Divinity from Harvard Divinity School and a Master of Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health simultaneously, becoming the first person in the history of Harvard University to do so. She became the associate minister at the Holy Temple Church in Roxbury, MA and the CEO and Founder of A Place to Heal Ministries in Cambridge, which she established in 2010.


== Awards and publications ==
In 1995, Nova and WGBH-TV produced a documentary series, Discovering Women, which aired through March and April and included a one-hour segment on Jordan.

10,"Susan Laurie Kamil (September 16, 1949 – September 8, 2019) was the publisher (as of 2018) as well as editor-in-chief of the Random House Publishing Group.


== Career ==
Susan Kamil was born in Manhattan, where she attended the High School of Music & Art. After graduating from George Washington University, she began her publishing career at Simon & Schuster in 1979. Kamil was a subsidiary rights director and then became a senior editor at Simon & Schuster working under Joni Evans. Evans was married to Dick Snyder, then CEO of Simon & Schuster. When Evans divorced Snyder in 1987 in a very public divorce, Evans moved over to Random House as Publisher, taking Kamil with her. Kamil said that Dick Snyder, CEO of Simon & Schuster ""taught me everything--not just business lessons, life lessons--and I'll always be grateful to him.""At Random House, Kamil was executive editor at ""Little Random"" under Joni Evans. Both women later formed the imprint Turtle Bay books at ""Big"" Random House in 1991. Early titles from Turtle Bay focused on celebrity memoirs that had ultimately disappointing sales including Michael Caine's, What's It About?, Joan Rivers's Still Talking, and Brandon Tartikoff's The Last Great Ride. An exposé in New York magazine said that the fate of Turtle Bay Books was sealed by the infamous ""Hair Piece."" The New York Times ran a photo in the Business section featuring ""a huge photograph of Evans and her glamorous gang of four looked like a fashion shoot."" The title of the article was Random House's Glitzy New Imprint and Susan Kamil was in the photo. In the article, Joni Evans was quoted as saying, ""What we normally talk about at these meetings is our hair."" New York Magazine went on to report that ""Jimmy Breslin told a friend of Evans's that she had the best-looking 'house' he'd ever seen. The Post's 'Page 6' christened the venture the Brownstone o' Babes. 'They looked like Charlie's Angels,' says one editor. 'Suddenly the whole thing seemed like a joke, and I don't know if they ever overcame it.'"" Kamil and other women in the photo certainly did overcome it—Kamil becoming CEO of Random House, Julie Grau founding the imprint Spiegel and Grau, and Karen Rinaldi as Senior Vice-President at Harper Wave.The Turtle Bay imprint was shuttered in 1993 after only two years and Kamil moved over to Bantam Doubleday Dell. It was there that she revived Dial Press as an imprint. The original Dial Press had been closed in 1985.In 2008 she was named the editorial director for Dial Press and the editor-in-chief for the Random House Publishing Group or ""Little Random."" Kamil was promoted to Publisher for both Dial and Random House Publishing Group in 2010.Kamil edited many notable books and authors including The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, The Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman, Major Pettigrew's Last Stand by Helen Simonson, and Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series.  Other notable authors she worked with include Allegra Goodman, Elizabeth McCracken and Franz Lidz, whose childhood memoir Unstrung Heroes was the first book she purchased at Simon & Schuster. She died from complications of lung cancer in Manhattan on September 8, 2019, aged 69.

11,"Karen Kane is an American fashion designer. Her designs are known for their relaxed, California-inspired feeling.


== Biography ==
Kane was born in the Akron suburb Barberton, Ohio, the youngest of three children. At the age of 9, her family moved from Ohio to Santa Barbara, California, where she grew up sewing and taking as many fashion-related classes as possible.Karen Kane started her career in fashion when she graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles at the age of 19. Her first job was as a pattern maker at a junior sportswear company. It was there that she met her husband and future business partner, Lonnie. In 1979, Karen and Lonnie married and launched the Karen Kane womenswear collection out of their Studio City garage. Initially, the brand was sold only at smaller specialty stores, but as the line expanded, it was picked up by department stores such as Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Belk, and Von Maur, online retailers like Zappos, Gwynnie Bee, Lord & Taylor, Wolf & Badger, and large national specialty stores.
In 2012, Karen Kane was invited to the White House to attend US President Barack Obama's ""Insourcing American Jobs"" summit and later that year, US Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis toured Kane's headquarters in California to learn more about the challenges of domestically manufacturing apparel in the United States. In 2011, 80% of Kane’s line was made in the United States and 20% was imported from other countries. In Spring 2012, that percentage increased to 90%. As of Fall 2013, Kane continued to manufacture most of her collection in the United States (primarily in Southern California).In 2008, Karen Kane launched Fifteen Twenty, a collection of assorted separates primarily made of silk. The brand has been worn by celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Biel, Carrie Underwood, Jessica Alba, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and others. In 2011, Kane introduced a casual complement to her Fifteen Twenty line entitled Red 23. “The line of T-shirts, tank tops, sweaters, jackets and scarves in neutral colors…will be carried by high-end specialty stores.” In 2015, Red 23 was absorbed into Fifteen Twenty to broaden the main brand into a larger collection. Today, Fifteen Twenty is a full collection of tops, jackets, dresses, skirts, and pants, and is sold in high-end specialty stores and online boutiques such as Nordstrom and Rent The Runway.
In 2013, Kane selected IMG (company) to represent the brand in developing licensed products.During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kane's company temporarily shifted production from manufacturing clothing to making face covers for medical workers, nursing homes, first responders, and other at-risk individuals.


== Company ==
Kane's clothing is most well known for having an easy, relaxed style that is reflective of her native California. In 2020, Kane's company earned B Corporation (certification). Kane is privately owned and family operated.
In addition to sizes XS-XL, the brand also produces a plus size division of the lifestyle collection entitled Karen Kane Women’s, as well as petite sizes. In 2013, Kane added a sixth division to her company: Robert Michaels. Named for her two sons (Michael & Robert), the collection consists of knit dresses, tops, and sweaters, and is sold exclusively at Bloomingdale's. Kane's husband, Lonnie, currently serves as the Chairman of the California Fashion Association. Since its inception, Kane's business has always been family-run. Her parents, Olga and Frank, were the company's first accounting and facilities employees. Lonnie's mother, Cecelia, worked in customer service and eventually handled employee benefits.  Karen and Lonnie's older son, Michael, serves as the company's other co-president. Their younger son, Robert, designed a line of t-shirts that appeared in the 'Karen by Karen Kane' summer collection.

She subsequently began working at Body, a local clothing store in Encino, California, where she worked for four years, assisting in the opening of the Calabasas location. In 2000, after entering into her first marriage, she resigned.


== Career ==


=== Beginnings (2003–2006) ===
By 2003, Kardashian was working as a personal stylist to the R&B singer and actress, Brandy, the sister of Ray J. Later, the siblings' mother (and manager) Sonja Norwood, alleged that in 2004 she had authorized Kardashian to make ""one and only one"" purchase on her American Express credit card and that nevertheless Kardashian and her sisters Khloé and Kourtney had incurred over $120,000 in unauthorized charges to that card. Norwood also alleged that the bulk of the charges were attributable to purchases made at Kardashian's family-owned boutique in 2006 and 2007, after Kardashian was no longer employed by Norwood's daughter. Norwood further alleged that, at the request of her children, she did not file criminal charges, instead presenting her allegations personally to Kardashian, and that Kardashian apologized and promised to repay the debt. In 2008, no payments having been forthcoming, Norwood filed a lawsuit. Kardashian has denied all these allegations. In 2009, the parties reportedly reached a confidential settlement, and the lawsuit was dismissed.In 2006, Kardashian had begun working as a stylist for Paris Hilton, a childhood friend of hers. She appeared in several episodes of the reality series The Simple Life and was frequently photographed accompanying Hilton to events and parties. Sheeraz Hasan, a PR strategist working with Hilton, had previously met Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner in 2005, and stated in a 2020 20/20 television special that Kardashian was ""ready to do whatever it takes"" to create a successful brand. Rick Mendozza, a freelance photographer on assignment for the tabloid TMZ, remarked in the same interview that, when Kardashian accompanied Hilton to nightclub Hyde, which was a Hollywood hotspot at the time, he continued to get assignments from tabloids to get photographs of Kardashian for the next three years. In 2021, Kardashian said that Hilton ""literally gave me a career. And I totally acknowledge that.""


=== Breakthrough (2007–2010) ===
In February 2007, a sex tape made by Kardashian and singer Ray J in 2003 was leaked on the internet and gained national attention. Kardashian filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment for distributing the film as Kim Kardashian, Superstar. She dropped the suit 3 months later and settled for a reported US$5 million, giving Vivid permission to market and sell copies of the tape. Sales from the film reportedly generated nearly US$1.5 million in revenue in the first six weeks. Several media outlets later criticized her and her family for using the sex tape's release as a publicity stunt to promote their forthcoming reality show. In October 2007, a few months later, Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, her step-parent Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce Jenner), her siblings Kourtney, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, began to appear in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The series proved successful for E!, and led to the creation of a number of spin-offs, including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami. The flagship series concluded in June 2021 after 294 episodes.Kardashian posed in a nude pictorial for the December 2007 issue of Playboy, and appeared on the cover of the November 2010 issue of Romanian Playboy, promoting a pictorial titled ""Poezia Unui Fund Bombat"" (The Poetry of a Bulging Ass). She made her feature film debut, opposite Carmen Electra, in the disaster film spoof Disaster Movie (2008), in which she appeared as a character named Lisa. In 2008, she was a participant on season seven of Dancing with the Stars, where she was partnered with Mark Ballas. She was the third contestant to be eliminated. In September 2009, Fusion Beauty and Seven Bar Foundation launched ""Kiss Away Poverty"", with Kardashian as the face of the campaign. For each LipFusion lipgloss sold, US$1 went to the Foundation to fund women entrepreneurs in the United States. In October, she launched her first fragrance, self-titled ""Kim Kardashian"". That year, she also released a workout DVD series, became a guest host–judge of WrestleMania XXIV on America's Next Top Model, and guest-starred in How I Met Your Mother, Beyond the Break, and CBS's CSI: NY.
By 2010, Kardashian had ventured into several new endorsement deals, including endorsing various food products for Carl's Jr. On July 1, 2010, the New York City branch of Madame Tussauds revealed a wax figure of Kardashian. Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé wrote an autobiography titled Kardashian Konfidential, which was released in stores on November 23, 2010, and appeared on New York Times's Best Seller List. In December 2010, she filmed a music video for a song titled ""Jam (Turn It Up)"". The video was directed by Hype Williams; Kanye West makes a cameo in the video. Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010. The song was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, ""There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun—with a good cause"". Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a ""dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature"", and suggested that the single made Kardashian the ""worst singer in the reality TV universe"".In 2010, Kardashian also served as producer for The Spin Crowd, a reality television show about a New York City public relations firm run by Jonathan Cheban and Simon Huck, appeared on season ten of The Apprentice, and guest starred with Khloé and Kourtney as themselves on the season three premiere episode of the series 90210.


=== Continued exposure (2011–2016) ===
In 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance, ""Gold"", as well as a novel, Dollhouse, along with sisters Kourtney and Khloe. In 2012, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million. That year, Kardashian released her fourth fragrance, ""True Reflection"", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote, and her fifth fragrance, ""Glam"", which was made available through Debenhams. In Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor (2013), a romantic drama produced, written, and directed by Tyler Perry, Kardashian obtained the role of the co-worker of an ambitious therapist. While the film was a moderate box office success, with a worldwide gross of US$53.1 million, critical response was negative and Kardashian won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.
Kardashian released Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a mobile game for iPhone and Android, in June 2014. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet. The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items. It was a hit, earning US$1.6 million in its first five days of release. In July, developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store. She voiced an alien in the September 21, 2014, episode of the adult animated series American Dad!.Kardashian appeared on the cover and in a pictorial in Paper's winter 2014 issue, photographed by Jean-Paul Goude. On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: ""Break the Internet"", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media. A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and ""trying to tear down"" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was ""just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise."" However, the stunt ""set a new benchmark"" in social media response, and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself, in May 2015. It received positive reviews from critics, with Kat Brown of The Telegraph describing it as ""unexpectedly revealing"" and ""oddly moving"". That year, she was also the cover model for the August issue of Vogue Spain, and released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji. The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps in its first week of release.By November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kardashian was reportedly paid at least US$300,000 for each post that she made on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well-known charities. Business Insider later estimated her fee to be around US$720,000 per Instagram post. Even though engagement data indicates that her posts are worth slightly less, her regular features in the news allows her to demand a premium above any calculated Instagram sponsored post price.


=== Business ventures (2017–present) ===

After announcing a new range of shapewear called Kimono in June, Kardashian was heavily criticized over the name of the brand, which critics argued disrespected Japanese culture and ignored the significance behind the traditional outfit. Following the launch of the range, the hashtag #KimOhNo began trending on Twitter and the mayor of Kyoto wrote to Kardashian to ask her to reconsider the trademark on Kimono. In response to public pressure, she announced that she would change the name. However, Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko stated that he would still be dispatching patent officials for a meeting at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and that Japan would keep an eye on the situation. In August 2019, she rebranded the shapewear company to the name ""Skims;"" it officially launched the following month on its web store and shortly after, was made available on various other retailers such as SSENSE, David Jones, Net-a-Porter, and Ounass.In February 2020, Skims entered its first retail partnership with luxury store chain Nordstrom.

In October 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Kardashian had agreed to pay a $1.26 million fine, to not promote cryptocurrency assets for three years, and to cooperate with an ongoing investigation without admitting or denying wrongdoing for failing to report receiving a $250,000 payment to promote the EthereumMax token.

== Personal life ==


=== Relationships ===
In 2000, at 19 years old, Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas. Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later blamed their separation on physical and emotional abuse on his part and said she was high on ecstasy during their wedding ceremony. Before her divorce was finalized, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.Kardashian then dated Reggie Bush. Their relationship began after Matt Leinart introduced them at the 2007 ESPY Awards. They split on July 27, 2009 and got back together on September 28, 2009.

They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California. Earlier that month, she had released her ""wedding fragrance"" called ""Kim Kardashian Love"" which coincided with her own wedding. A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding. After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences. Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures. A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed a suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and later settled the case that included an apology from Jaxson. A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split. The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries. Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013, Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday, and married on May 24, 2014, at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.

West said Kardashian was his muse.In January 2021, CNN reported that the couple were discussing divorce and on February 19, 2021, Kardashian officially filed for divorce. In April 2021, they both agreed before court that they would end their marriage due to ""irreconcilable differences"" and agreed to joint custody of their four children. They also agreed that neither of them need spousal support. In February 2022, Kardashian filed a complaint to the Los Angeles Superior Court, asking for a quicker proceedings in the divorce from West, saying that West was trying to delay it and saying that ""Mr. West, by his actions, has made it clear that he does not accept that the parties' marital relationship is over.""

=== Paris robbery ===
On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry. The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag. Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life. She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped. On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed ""on hold indefinitely"" after the robbery.After the robbery was announced, several critics expressed skepticism about whether it was staged or not, with some even drawing comparison to Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte's recent false robbery claim. On October 10, 2016, a video was released showing Kardashian immediately after the robbery, as police began conducting their investigation. In the video, she is seen using the cell phone that she had reported stolen, and did not have any of the markings she claimed from being bound by her captors, prompting more questions as to whether or not the events were staged. In response, Kardashian filed lawsuits against several media outlets the following day, and secured a gag order to get the video removed from any articles due to it being part of an active police investigation. On October 25, 2016, Kardashian dropped the lawsuit, prompting more criticism that the robbery was a ploy to generate media attention. Production resumed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians on October 26.On January 9, 2017, French police detained 17 persons of interest for questioning in the robbery case. Later in 2017, 16 people were arrested for their alleged involvement. It was revealed in 2020 that French prosecutors would seek trial for 12 of the suspects. The suspects who allegedly entered her room were of, or near, senior age and were named the 'Grandpa Robbers' by the press. In 2021, the suspects were still awaiting trial with at least one of the five who entered Kardashian's room reportedly set to plead no contest to the charges.


== Activism ==
During an interview with Caity Weaver of GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Democrat, and declared her support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.In January 2017, she tweeted a table of statistics that went viral, highlighting statistics that show that gun violence in the United States kills 11,737 people annually while terrorism in the United States kills 14 people annually. In December 2017, the tweet was mentioned by the Royal Statistical Society in the announcement of its ""International Statistic of the Year"" for 2017. On a trip to Uganda in October 2018, she and her husband met with President Yoweri Museveni. They had a press conference, and Kanye talked about tourism in Uganda. They were criticized for meeting Museveni due to his being a dictator and his recent crackdown on the opposition and the Ugandan LGBT community.In April 2019, Vogue reported that Kardashian was studying to pass the bar exam; instead of attending law school, she is ""reading law"". In 2021, Kardashian said she had failed her first-year law exam (the baby bar) for a second time, performing ""slightly worse"" than her first attempt earlier in the year. In December 2021, she passed the ""baby bar"" law exam on her fourth attempt.In 2020, Kardashian condemned the actions of Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and expressed her support for Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh. On November 20, 2021, it was reported that Kardashian and the English soccer club Leeds United F.C., with the help of Rabbi Moshe Margertten of the Tzedek Association, had financially helped female Afghan soccer players to make their way safely to England. The women and girls had escaped Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover, but were stranded in Pakistan.


=== Armenian genocide recognition ===
Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry. She is not a citizen of either Armenia or the United Kingdom, and does not speak Armenian. She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian genocide on numerous occasions and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement. In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement by FactCheckArmenia.com denying the Armenian genocide. In April 2021, Kardashian wrote a letter to President Joe Biden thanking him for officially recognizing the Armenian genocide and becoming the first United States president ever to do so.In April 2015, Kardashian traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé, and her eldest daughter and visited the Armenian Genocide Memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan. On October 10, 2020, Kardashian announced she donated $1 million to Armenia Fund, a humanitarian organization that supports Armenia's development.


=== Prison reform and clemency advocacy ===
Kardashian has worked in the area of prison reform, advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Chris Young and also of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense as the leader of a major cocaine ring in Tennessee which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018. Along with Van Jones and Jared Kushner, she was instrumental in persuading President Trump to support the First Step Act, which enacted major reforms in the US prison system. Van Jones later stated that without Kardashian, the act would have never passed because it would not have received the president's support. It was later passed by a great majority in the US Senate.
In 2019, Kardashian largely funded the 90 Days to Freedom campaign, an initiative to release nonviolent drug offenders from life sentences by attorneys Brittany K. Barnett and MiAngel Cody. The effort resulted in 17 persons being released under provisions of the First Step Act. Kardashian was widely credited for the success of the campaign in media headlines. Commentary on her involvement ranged from praise, to assertions that it was a public relations stunt, to accusations that she was taking the credit for work she did not do. In a Facebook post from May 7 of that year, Barnett commented on the divisive and underfunded nature of the ""criminal justice reform space"", adding, ""Kim linked arms with us to support us when foundations turned us down. We and our clients and their families have a lot of love for her and are deeply grateful for her.""In April 2022, Kardashian advocated for the clemency of Melissa Lucio, the only woman of Hispanic descent on Texas' death row, in a series of tweets. She tweeted, ""I recently just read about the case of Melissa Lucio and wanted to share her story with you. She has been on death row for over 14 years for her daughter's death that was a tragic accident."" Lucio is on death row for the abuse and death of her daughter, who was two years old. Kardashian deleted the series of tweets the same day. When Lucio was granted a stay of execution on April 25, Kardashian celebrated on her social media channels.In July 2022, Kardashian expressed support and petitioned for the release of rapper Gunna, who was imprisoned without bond, charged with one count of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. However, in October of the same year, Gunna was again denied release from jail ahead of his January trial. In December, Gunna pled guilty to a single charge of racketeering and was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year commuted to time served and the rest of the sentence suspended subject to probation conditions. He was soon released from jail, and instead was ordered to serve 500 hours of community service.

30,"Georgette Klinger (née Eckstein; February 28, 1915 – January 9, 2004) was a Moravian-born American businesswoman and cosmetologist who founded skin care brand Georgette Klinger Inc. in New York City in 1941. Born into a wealthy family in Brno, Moravia, she became interested in beauty care after developing an acne rash from applying cosmetic products she won at a beauty contest. Klinger opened her first salon in 1938 before closing it a year later so she and her family could flee abroad when the Nazi Party invaded Czechoslovakia. 
She formed her business from a bank loan of $15,000 and expanded it to operating nine salons by the time of its sale to a financial and investment firm in 1998. Klinger devised the first specialized treatment programs for teenagers in 1967 before expanding it to men five years later. She co-authored a book with Barbara Rowes in 1979, and was invited to join The Committee of 200 in 1982. Klinger's salons have been cited by experts as a precursor to the multi-billion spa industry, and she brought European-style female skin care to the United States.


== Biography ==
Klinger was born in Brno, Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic) on February 28, 1915. She was the third child and the sole daughter of textile manufacturer Benno Eckstein and gardener and weaver Ilona Eckstein (née Rosenthal). Klinger had three brothers, was raised in a wealthy family, who owned a summer home in Brno to entertain foreign visitors. She was educated in cosmetic chemistry in schools in Budapest, Vienna, and Paris, before she won a beauty contest in her homeland aged 18. The cosmetic products Klinger won irritated her skin, and gave her a breakout that caused a persistent acne rash. Klinger's mother took her to a professor of dermatology in Vienna, and the two women ventured to other cities for a period of two years for treatment, which was initially unsuccessful. She had listened to the professor of dermatology, by learning the business side of beauty care in Budapest and Prague, and cured herself.In 1938, Klinger withstood the objections from the family of her husband about working, and she and a local doctor opened her first skin care salon in her hometown of Brno. Because of her young age, she wore spectacles and tied her hair into a bun to make her appear older to customers. When the Nazi Party of Adolf Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, Klinger and her family fled to London by providing authorities with exit visas. In London, she established a costume jewelry business, which she later relinquished to a friend of hers; she worked secretly to liberate Czechoslovakia during World War II. She emigrated to New York City on an empty troop ship in 1941, after the bombing of London became severe. Klinger had no money; she found adjusting to life in the United States difficult at first due to the country's sense of humor and cried when she was called ""honey"" by others. She had an uncle who resided in Great Neck, New York; he, the wife of a publisher, and a broker helped Klinger secure a bank loan of $15,000, with the belief her methodology would prove effective.The bank loan allowed her to open a shop called Georgette Klinger Inc. at 509 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; she created her projects from fresh and natural ingredients with herbs and fruits in her kitchen during the early years of her career. Klinger was one of the first to advise against exposure to the sun to prevent premature aging, told clients to consume extra water, not to use soap to clean themselves, to eschew hairspray, and avoid applying a large amount of make-up as used in Hollywood beauty. She connected air pollution and smoking to poor skin care. avoided products tested on animals, employed personnel who had been trained in Europe, and wore a magnifying glass on her neck. She visited her stores regularly, provided equal treatment to her customers regardless of their social class, and published a small amount of advertising due to a partial dislike of large wording. preferring word of mouth. Klinger moved the flagship store to 501 Madison Avenue in 1959, and opened a second salon in the Los Angeles suburb of Beverly Hills ten years later. She devised the first specialized treatment programs for teenagers in 1967 and men five years later.Klinger stated to The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1984 that she was the first skin care specialist to introduce elasticity-saving collagen protein in the United States and the first to produce perfume-free products. She trademarked the company name in 1977, and ran four salons in the United States by 1979. That same year, she and Barbara Rowes co-authored Georgette Klinger’s Skincare to talk about her skin care methodology. In October 1981, Klinger received the Eye Research Institute of the Retina Foundation's inaugural Woman of Vision Award, and in 1982 was invited to join The Committee of 200, which was composed of businesswomen who ran businesses with an annual turnover of $5 million. She established a factory and laboratory in New Jersey to expand the manufacture of her products to a wide scale in 1982. Klinger's company reported annual revenues of $20 million by the early 1990s, and had a mail order section. After repeatedly declining offers to sell her business to larger firms since the 1970s, she sold it to Madison, Wisconsin-based financial and investment firm Pyle Group in 1998, by which time had nine salons.


== Personal life ==
Klinger married lawyer Frank Klinger in 1938 and divorced in around 1946. Her second marriage to Venezuelan businessperson Jacobo Eisenberg in 1949 until his death in 1976 led to the birth of a daughter, Kathryn, in 1951. Kathryn joined her mother's business soon after graduating from college in 1970. Klinger became a naturalised citizen of the United States on an unknown date. She died from natural causes caused by a decline in her health at Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City on January 9, 2004. A service for Klinger was held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Manhattan on January 11, and is buried in Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale.


== Personality and legacy ==
The Ottawa Citizen described Klinger in her later years as ""a silver-haired woman with soft sloping gray eyes and luminous porcelain skin"", and ""a quietly elegant woman"". Her Eastern European accent caused her to pronounce Ws as Vs, such as ""vomen's skin needs vauhter"", was fluent in seven languages. and admired opera. She was known to scrutinize her employees, and was a perfectionist. Maureen O'Sullivan of Palm Beach Daily News noted Klinger did not ""sugar coat her assessments"" and provided staff with support and assistance. She mandated salon facialists to sport white uniforms and call customers ""Miss"" to create calmness. Her public image was one of her being rarely seen without sporting a hat, and preferred to wear uncomfortable shoes.Called the ""Dean of Skin Care"", her salons became a precursor of the multi-billion dollar spa industry, brought European-style female skin care to the United States, and according to O'Sullivan, introduced scientific skin care to the country. Douglas Martin of The New York Times wrote Klinger's approach of treating the skin ""as a tender, living organ, not a surface in need of decoration"" had ""revolutionized cosmetic skin care.""

Krawcheck (born November 28, 1964) is the former head of Bank of America's Global Wealth and Investment Management division and is currently the CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial advisor for women launched in 2016. She has been called ""the most powerful woman on Wall Street.""


== Early life and education ==
Krawcheck grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. She has described her childhood as ""half Jewish, half WASP-y"". She attended the Porter-Gaud School. While in high school, she participated on the school's track and field team. In 1983, as a high school senior, she was honored as a South Carolina Presidential Scholar. She received a Morehead Scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and graduated with a degree in journalism. In 1992, she obtained an MBA from Columbia Business School.


== Career ==


=== Sanford C. Bernstein ===
Krawcheck started her business career as equity analyst covering the Wall Street firms, rising to become director of research and then chairman and CEO of sell-side research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. She had a reputation for impartial advice and her decision to take Bernstein out of the lucrative, but conflicted underwriting business, caused Fortune to dub her ""The Last Honest Analyst."" Citigroup sought her out to deal with criticisms over conflicts of interest within its wealth management and research business after charges were brought against the company by Eliot Spitzer.


=== Citigroup ===
Krawcheck was named CEO of Citigroup's (then new) Smith Barney unit, for which she was named to Time's 2002 list of ""Global Influentials"" and Fortune's Most Influential Person Under the Age of 40. The Smith Barney unit was set up in order to separate Citigroup's investment banking from its stock brokering and research operations, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in those areas.

At the time of her arrival, the Private Bank had been thrown out of Japan for sales practice issues; this, combined with continuing Citi regulatory issues, resulted in financial advisor attrition that was at an all-time high. She worked to change the corporate culture for Smith Barney's financial advisors as an early advocate of a fiduciary standard for the brokerage industry.Krawcheck left Citi on September 22, 2008, following months of tension with chief executive officer Vikram Pandit due to the fact that Krawcheck argued for Citi to reimburse clients for defective investments distributed by Citi wealth management's brokers and bankers. Pandit and other chief officers at Citi disagreed, arguing that Citi had no legal obligation in the matter.


=== Bank of America ===
Following the acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2009, Bank of America hired Krawcheck to head the new division. Although Bank of America then-chief executive Ken Lewis had attempted to cancel the deal in the weeks before it closed, fearing Merrill Lynch was in worse financial condition than previously known, Krawcheck led the unit to $3.1 billion in profits during her two years as president of the wealth management unit. In the second quarter of 2011, Krawcheck's division increased net income by 54 percent, from $329 million to $506 million, while Bank of America posted an overall $8.8 billion loss.Krawcheck's position at Merrill was eliminated by the firm's new chief executive, Brian Moynihan, as part of restructuring, and Krawcheck left Bank of America on September 6, 2011. She received severance payments of $6 million.


=== Ellevate Network ===
Krawcheck acquired 85 Broads Unlimited LLC. (which is now doing business as Ellevate Network) in 2013 and is now the chairwoman of the organization.


=== Ellevest ===
Krawcheck is the co-founder and CEO of Ellevest, a digital investment platform for women. Ellevest's goal is to work to close the gender investing gap in the U.S. by ""redefining investing for women.""

42,"Estée Lauder ( EST-ay LAW-dər; née Josephine Esther Mentzer; July 1, 1908 – April 24, 2004) was an American businesswoman. She co-founded her eponymous cosmetics company with her husband, Joseph Lauter (later Lauder). Lauder was the only woman on Time magazine's 1998 list of the 20 most influential business geniuses of the 20th century.


== Early life and education ==
Lauder was born Josephine Esther Mentzer in Corona, Queens, New York City, the second child born to Rose Schotz and Max Mentzer. Her parents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants. Her mother's mother was from Sátoraljaújhely and her mother's father was from Gelle (now Holice, Slovakia), while her father had Czech-Jewish ancestry. Lauder's claims of descent from European aristocracy were discredited in a biography, Estée Lauder: Beyond the Magic (1985) by Lee Israel. Her New York Times obituary observed ""she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all"", notwithstanding ""the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry"". Her ""favourite story was that she had been brought up by her Viennese mother in fashionable Flushing, Long Island, in a sumptuous home with stables, a chauffeured car and an Italian nurse.""In actuality, her mother Rose emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1898 with her five children at the time to join her first husband, Abraham Rosenthal. In 1905, Rose married Max Mentzer, a shopkeeper who had also immigrated to the United States in the 1890s. When their daughter was born, they wanted to name her Eszti, the diminutive form of the Hungarian first name Eszter, after her mother's favorite Hungarian aunt, but decided at the last minute to keep the name ""Josephine"", which they had agreed upon. However, the baby's nickname became ""Estee"", the name she would grow up using and responding to. Eventually, when she launched her perfume empire with her husband, she added an accent mark to make her name look French and began pronouncing it the way her father had in his Hungarian accent.Lauder spent much of her childhood trying to make ends meet. Like most of her eight siblings, she worked at the family's hardware store, where she got her first taste of business, entrepreneurship, and what it takes to be a successful retailer. Her childhood dream was to become an actress with her ""name in lights, flowers and handsome men"".
When Lauder grew older, she agreed to help her uncle, Dr. John Schotz, with his business. Schotz was a chemist, and his company, New Way Laboratories, sold beauty products such as creams, lotions, rouge, and fragrances. She became more interested in his business than her father's. She was fascinated watching her uncle create his products. He also taught her how to wash her face and do facial massages. After graduating from Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens, New York, she focused on her uncle's business.


== Career ==
Lauder named one of her uncle's blends Super Rich All-Purpose Cream, and began selling the preparation to her friends.: 115  She sold creams like Six-In-One cold cream and Dr. Schotz's Viennese Cream to beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts. One day, as she was getting her hair done at the House of Ash Blondes, the salon's owner Florence Morris asked Lauder about her perfect skin. Soon, Estée returned to the beauty parlor to hand out four of her uncle's creams and demonstrate their use. Morris was so impressed that she asked Lauder to sell her products at Morris's new salon.: 116 In 1953, Lauder introduced her first fragrance, Youth-Dew, a bath oil that doubled as a perfume. Instead of using French perfumes by the drop behind each ear, women began using Youth-Dew by the bottle in their bath water. In the first year, it sold 50,000 bottles; by 1984, the figure had risen to 150 million.Lauder was a subject of a 1985 TV documentary, Estée Lauder: The Sweet Smell of Success. Explaining her success, she said, ""I have never worked a day in my life without selling. If I believe in something, I sell it, and I sell it hard.""


== Awards and honors ==
Lauder received the Chevalier (Knight) class of the Legion of Honour from the Consul General of France, Gerard Causer, on January 16, 1978. She was the first woman to receive this honor.She was inducted to the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1988. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004.


== Personal life ==
Estée met Joseph Lauder when she was in her early twenties. On January 15, 1930, they married. Their surname was later changed from Lauter to Lauder. Their first child, Leonard, was born March 19, 1933.: 115  The couple separated then divorced in 1939 and she moved to Florida, but they remarried in 1942. Their second son, Ronald, was born in 1944. Estée and Joseph Lauder remained married until his death in 1983, and she later regretted her divorce, saying that she married young and assumed that she had missed out on life but soon found out that she had the ""sweetest husband in the world"".Leonard became the chief executive of Estée Lauder and then chairman of the board. Ronald was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration and was U.S. Ambassador to Austria in 1986–87. As of 2021, he is the president of the World Jewish Congress.

She has won an Academy Award, a BAFTA  Award and an Annie Award, and has been nominated for one more BAFTA Award and two more Annie Awards.


== Early life ==
Jennifer Michelle Rebecchi was born on October 22, 1971 to Linda Lee and Saverio Rebecchi, who were living in Barrington, Rhode Island at the time. After their divorce, Lee and her older sister Amy, who later became an English teacher, lived with their mother in East Providence, Rhode Island.

== Career ==
Lee graduated from Columbia University School of the Arts' Film Program with an MFA in film in 2005. While at Columbia, she won several awards for excellence in screenwriting and gave birth to her daughter.Her script for The Round Up was a quarter-finalist in the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting competition in 2009 and was subsequently optioned by Appian Way Productions.In March 2011, Phil Johnston, a former classmate at Columbia, called Lee to ask her to join him at Disney Animation in Burbank to help him write Wreck-It Ralph. What was supposed to be a temporary eight-week writing gig eventually turned into a much longer commitment. First, she was asked to stay on until Ralph was finished. She then became involved with Frozen, initially as screenwriter and later as director alongside Chris Buck. When Lee was brought on board, she helped transition the film from an action-adventure to ""more musical, with more comedy."" She worked closely with the songwriters (Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez) in the writing of the script.

It was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by Warner Bros.' Wonder Woman.On May 17, 2014, Lee delivered the commencement address to the class of 2014 at her alma mater, the University of New Hampshire.  She revealed that she had struggled with self-doubt while growing up,: 2:00  and then in April of her junior year of college, her boyfriend was killed in a boating accident, after which she felt ""no doubt, only grief ... and for a brief moment ... [knew] better than to waste a second doubting."": 6:18   Years later, that memory would help her overcome her initial doubt over whether she was good enough to apply to Columbia.: 7:10  At Columbia, Johnston recognized she was talented but insecure, and one day asked her to ""promise ... that you'll leave it out of your work, just know that you're good enough and move on.""  She concluded: ""If I learned one thing it is that self-doubt is one of the most destructive forces. It makes you defensive instead of open, reactive instead of active. Self-doubt is consuming and cruel and my hope today is that we can all collectively agree to ban it ... Please know, from here on out, you are enough and dare I say, more than enough.""  UNH then awarded her the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.In September 2014, it was announced that Lee and Buck would co-direct a short film featuring the Frozen characters called Frozen Fever. It was released in March 2015. Lee was one of several Disney writers and directors who received credit for ""Creative Leadership"" on the 2014 film Big Hero 6 and the 2016 film Moana, and received screen credit as one of the writers who developed the story for the 2016 film Zootopia.In August 2014, Variety reported that Lee's next project after Frozen would be an adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 novel A Wrinkle in Time.

57,"Nadya Lev (born in Moscow, Russia) is a Russian-American photographer, editor, publisher, designer, and entrepreneur.


== Early life ==
Nadya Lev spent her childhood in the USSR, growing up in a Soviet dissident family.


== Career ==


=== Photography ===
Lev began her photography career at age 21, shooting the 50th anniversary cover for fetish fashion magazine Skin Two. Subsequently, her work was used by Vogue Italia, MTV, Dazed & Confused, Elle, Marie Claire, New York Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, The Museum at FIT and Nick Knight's SHOWStudio in features on alternative fashion. Lev's work has been described as sitting at the crossroads of portraiture and fashion, with her subjects possessing an ""almost surreal combination of hollow power"" and her work emphasizing ""the model as storyteller rather than empty object."" Seeking to understand photography from her models' perspective, Lev began posing as a subject for photographer colleagues. She has modeled for Clayton Cubitt, Allan Amato and Christopher Voelker.
In 2011, Lev became the second-youngest person in medical literature to be diagnosed with genetically-inherited PEX glaucoma. She lost a significant portion of her vision and underwent 15 eye surgeries. After adjusting to hallucination-like distortions in vision, Lev re-trained herself in photography and resumed publishing new work.In 2013, Lev was appointed as general manager and later CEO of Zivity, an art patronage platform for models and photographers founded by Cyan Banister.


=== Print publishing ===
Lev is one of the co-founders of Coilhouse Magazine – a print and web art publication established in 2007, together with Meredith Yayanos and Zoetica Ebb. The magazine's tagline was ""a love letter to alternative culture, in an era where alternative culture no longer exists."" Coilhouse was widely acclaimed for thoughtful coverage of art, music, fashion, film, technology and literature. Coilhouse has also been praised for its high production value and original graphic design by creative director Courtney Riot. Lev's design for the original Coilhouse website, inspired by Merz Magazine and El Lissitzky, won L.A. Weekly's Best-Designed Site Aesthetic Award.In 2017, Lev announced that she was working on a Japanese coffee-table art book titled Eros & Thanatos, together with Tokyo-based art magazine editor Masanao Amano.


=== Mixed reality ===
In 2016, Lev co-founded the technology company Aconite together with Star St. Germain. Lev describes Aconite as ""a mixed reality storytelling platform."" Lev and St.Germain define mixed reality stories as immersive experiences that sit at the intersection of adventure, narrative and gaming. The project draws on several gameplay, real-world exploration and storytelling traditions, including transmedia, psychogeography, escape rooms, and live-action roleplay.Aconite's first prototype was Limberlost, a location-based game with a magical realist narrative written by Steen Comer, designed to be played at any bookstore or library in the world. The first playtest took place at Powell's Books during XOXO Fest 2016 in Portland. Players used their mobile phones to solve puzzles which led them through a sequence of physical books. Each book contained an illustration that acted as an augmented reality marker. When triggered, the markers displayed audiovisual data that provided clues for the next book in the sequence, and unlocked new parts of the game's narrative.In 2019, Aconite came out of stealth mode and announced their first title, HoloVista.

They were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016.On December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a son in 2018.


=== Ancestry ===
According to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and  Faces of America host Henry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Longoria is the Castillanized form of this Asturian-language surname.
In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.According to DNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Indigenous American, and 3% African. After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is anciently related by human haplogroup to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Maya from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.
Longoria identifies as a ""Texican""—a Mexican-American Texan.

71,"Rebecca Lukens (1794–1854), born Rebecca Webb Pennock, was an American businesswoman. She was the owner and manager of the iron and steel mill which became the Lukens Steel Company of Coatesville, Pennsylvania.  Fortune Magazine called her ""America's first female CEO of an industrial company"" and its board of editors named her to the National Business Hall of Fame in 1994.


== History ==
Rebecca was the daughter of Quaker Isaac Pennock who founded the Federal Slitting Mill near Coatesville about 1793. She grew up in the business often accompanying her father in the mill. She went to boarding school first at Westtown School, a nearby Quaker Boarding school, and then at the Wilmington School for Girls in Wilmington, Delaware, where among other subjects, she studied chemistry. The slitting mill processed iron from other mills into barrel hoops and nails. It was called ""Federal"" in honor of the new constitution. By 1824, when Isaac died, the mill was known as the Brandywine Iron Works and Nail Factory, after Brandywine Creek which provided the water power for the mill.
She married Dr. Charles Lukens in 1813. He soon entered the iron business, and together the Lukens leased the mill from her father. Starting in 1816 they lived in ""Brandywine Mansion,"" which is now located within the Lukens Historic District. Charles experimented with new products, such as rolled steel plate, in the early 1820s. The steel plate was used to construct the first metal hulled steamboat in America, the Codorus, and was later used as boilerplate in steam engines and locomotives. Charles died in 1825, leaving Rebecca in charge of a company near bankruptcy. An inheritance dispute and the Panic of 1837 further complicated matters.

She ran the company until 1847, making it into the country's premier manufacturer of boilerplate. During her retirement she wrote an autobiography for her grandchildren. In 1848, she built Terracina as a wedding present for her daughter Isabella upon her marriage to Dr. Charles Huston.She is buried in Ercildoun, south of Coatesville, in the Fallowfield Orthodox Friends Burying Ground.


== Legacy and honors ==
During World War II the Liberty ship SS Rebecca Lukens was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in her honor.On January 6, 1994, the 200th anniversary of Lukens' birth, the Pennsylvania Legislature and City of Coatesville declared her ""America’s first woman industrialist."" The company remained independent until 1997, being ranked number 395 on the FORTUNE 500 industrial list in 1993.  As of 1994 the mill was considered the oldest continuously operating steel mill in the U.S. The mill is operating today under Cleveland-Cliffs. In 2020, Lukens was one of eight women featured in ""The Only One in the Room"" display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.


== Letters ==
In March 2015, a cache of at least ten letters were found in the walls of Brandywine Mansion. The letters are awaiting study and after review will be displayed in Coatesville. They contain business correspondence from as far away as Albany, New York.

73,"Barbara Lynch is an American restaurateur. In 2017,  she was included in Time magazine's ""Top 100 Most Influential People of the Year"" for her pioneering contributions in the culinary world and her focus on local wealth creation through agronomy.  In 2014, she was the second woman to be awarded the James Beard Foundation Award for Outstanding Restaurateur, which honors ""a working restaurateur who sets high national standards in restaurant operations and ownership.""


== Early life ==
Lynch grew up in South Boston during the era of desegregation busing. She was the youngest of six children, raised by a single mother.At age 13, she stole an MBTA bus ""just for laughs and never got caught.""That same year, she got her first kitchen job — making meals for the priests in the rectory of the church across from her family's home. It was there, along with inspiration from a home economics teacher, that led her to choose a career as a chef. Lynch did not complete high school. ""I figured if I could cook, I’d have a job for the rest of my life.""Lynch started as a waitress at Boston's St. Botolph Club at age 15. Its chef, Mario Bonello, ran an elegant white-glove dining establishment. ""He was making people happy by cooking. I knew then that was what I wanted to do. I would provide fantastic hospitality to make people feel amazing, with great china and great silverware and a great space. And it worked.""


== Career ==
Lynch worked with Todd English, starting in 1989. In the early 1990s, she accepted her first executive chef's job, at Rocco's, an Italian restaurant in Boston's theatre district. ""With a staff of 22 underneath me seven days a week, breakfast, lunch and dinner. By the time I was 34, I knew I didn’t want to work for another chef.""After touring Italy, she returned to Boston and was appointed executive chef at the trattoria Galleria Italiana, and subsequently won Food & Wine's “Ten Best New Chefs in America” award.
In 1998, she opened her first restaurant, No. 9 Park, near the Boston Common and Massachusetts State House.
In 2006, Lynch opened what she counts as one of her few failures. It was a produce store called Plum Produce on Waltham Street in Boston's South End. ""When I opened it in 2006, the South End was filled with young professionals who didn't like to cook during the week. My lesson was to do more research and understand the challenges of retail more.""Her business Barbara Lynch Gruppo now has 220 employees and grosses about $20 million annually. She oversees a catering company and several popular restaurants: No. 9 Park (a Brahmin Beacon Hill standard), Sportello (a date-night pasta place), Drink (a craft-cocktail bar), B&G Oysters (a seafood joint), the Butcher Shop (a meat counter and café), Menton (a fine-dining establishment) and Stir (an open demonstration kitchen where she offers classes).  The Barbara Lynch Gruppo includes the Boston restaurants No. 9 Park, B&G Oysters, and Menton (named in March 2014 one of the Top 10 Foodie Spots In Boston by USA Today).. As of March 2023, Lynch was working on opening The Rudder, a new restaurant in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  It will be her first opening in over a decade.Lynch also dedicates time and resources to several neighborhood organizations around Boston. An initiative by Lynch and her employees in 2011 promoted healthy and sustainable eating habits in at-risk schools in Boston.In April 2023 the New York Times published an article detailing employees’ claims they endured decades of abuse, sexual harassment, and alcohol-driven antics from Lynch. The accusations include workplace abuse that includes wage theft and withholding tips.Hilary Yeaw, a server at B&G Oyster, appeared on Greater Boston (news show) in early May 2023 with her lawyer. She is part of a class action lawsuit about the withheld tips. For two months in 2020, the restaurant paid the waitstaff a fixed rate and claimed the tips. The lawsuit is to have the tip money into the hands of the staff.
