5,"Annie Minerva Turnbo Malone (August 9, 1877 – May 10, 1957) was an American businesswoman, inventor and philanthropist. In the first three decades of the 20th century, she founded and developed a large and prominent commercial and educational enterprise centered on cosmetics for African-American women.


== Early life ==
Annie Minerva Turnbo was born in Metropolis, Illinois, the daughter of Robert and Isabella Turnbo, who had formerly been enslaved. When her father went off to fight for the Union with the 1st Kentucky Cavalry in the Civil War, Isabella took the couple's children and escaped from Kentucky, a neutral border state that maintained slavery. After traveling down the Ohio River, she found refuge in Metropolis, Illinois. Annie Turnbo was born on a farm near Metropolis in Massac County, Illinois., the tenth of eleven children.Orphaned at a young age, she attended a public school in Metropolis, before moving in 1896 to live with her older sister Ada Moody in Peoria.  There Turnbo attended high school, taking a particular interest in chemistry. However, due to frequent illness, she was forced to withdraw from classes.While out of school, Turnbo grew so fascinated with hair and hair care that she often practiced hairdressing with her sister. With expertise in both chemistry and hair care, Turnbo began to develop her own hair-care products. At the time, many women used goose fat, heavy oils, soap, or bacon grease to straighten their curls, which damaged both scalp and hair.


== Career ==
By the beginning of the 1900s, Turnbo moved with her older siblings to Lovejoy, now known as Brooklyn, Illinois. While experimenting with hair and different hair-care products, she developed and manufactured her own line of non-damaging hair straighteners, special oils, and hair-stimulant products for African-American women. She named her new product “Wonderful Hair Grower”. To promote her new product, Turnbo sold the Wonderful Hair Grower in bottles door-to-door. Her products and sales began to revolutionize hair-care methods for all African Americans.In 1902, Turnbo moved to a thriving St. Louis, where she and three employees sold her hair-care products door-to-door. As part of her marketing, she gave away free treatments to attract more customers.Due to the high demand for her product in St. Louis, Turnbo opened her first shop in 1902 at 2223 Market Street. She also launched a wide advertising campaign in the black press, held news conferences, toured many southern states, and recruited many women whom she trained to sell her products.One of her selling agents, Sarah Breedlove Davis, later known as Madam C. J. Walker, operated first in St. Louis and later in Denver, Colorado, until a disagreement led Walker to leave the company. Walker allegedly took the original Poro formula and created her own brand of it (this is disputed). This development was one of the reasons which led then Turnbo to copyright her products under the name ""Poro"" because of what she called fraudulent imitations and to discourage counterfeit versions. Poro may have received this name from a Mende word for devotional society or it may be a combination of the married names of Annie Pope and her sister Laura Roberts. Due to the growth in her business, in 1910 Turnbo moved to a larger facility on 3100 Pine Street.


=== Poro College ===
In 1918, she established Poro College, a cosmetology school and center. The building included a manufacturing plant, a retail store where Poro products were sold, business offices, a 500-seat auditorium, dining and meeting rooms, a roof garden, dormitory, gymnasium, bakery, and chapel. It served the African-American community as a center for religious and social functions.The college's curriculum addressed the whole student; students were coached on personal style for work: on walking, talking, and a style of dress designed to maintain a solid persona. Poro College employed nearly 200 people in St. Louis. Through its school and franchise businesses, the college created jobs for almost 75,000 women in North and South America, Africa and the Philippines.Her business thrived until 1927 when her husband filed for divorce. Having served as president of the company, he demanded half of the business' value, based on his claim that his contributions had been integral to its success. The divorce suit forced Poro College into court-ordered receivership. With support from her employees and powerful figures such as Mary McLeod Bethune, she negotiated a settlement of $200,000. This affirmed her as the sole owner of Poro College, and the divorce was granted.After the divorce, Turnbo moved most of her business to Chicago's South Parkway (now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive), where she bought an entire city block. Other lawsuits followed. In 1937, during the Great Depression, a former employee filed suit, also claiming credit for Poro's success. To raise money for the settlement, Turnbo Malone sold her St. Louis property. Although much reduced in size, her business continued to thrive.


== Philanthropy and personal life ==
In 1902 she married Nelson Pope; the couple divorced in 1907.On April 28, 1914, Annie Turnbo married Aaron Eugene Malone, a former teacher and religious book salesman.By the 1920s, Annie Turnbo Malone had become a multi-millionaire. In 1924 she paid income tax of nearly $40,000, reportedly the highest in Missouri. While extremely wealthy, Malone lived modestly, giving thousands of dollars to the local black YMCA and the Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C.She became a benefactor of the St. Louis Colored Orphans Home, where she served as president on the board of directors from 1919 to 1943. With her help, in 1922 the Home bought a facility at 2612 Goode Avenue, which was renamed Annie Malone Drive in her honor.The Orphans Home is located in the historic Ville neighborhood. Upgraded and expanded, the facility was renamed in the entrepreneur's honor as the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center. As well as funding many programs, Turnbo Malone ensured that her employees, all African American, were paid well and given opportunities for advancement.


== Death and legacy ==
Turnbo was named an honorary member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority and was awarded an honorary degree from Howard University.On May 10, 1957, Annie Turnbo suffered a stroke and died at Chicago's Provident Hospital. Childless, she had bequeathed her business and remaining fortune to her nieces and nephews. At the time of her death, her estate was valued at $100,000.St. Louis has an annual Annie Malone parade in support of children's charities.


== In media ==
A fictionalized version of Malone is portrayed by British actress Carmen Ejogo in the 2020 Netflix miniseries Self Made. In this version, the character is renamed Addie Munroe.Turnbo is featured in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story, that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry.

6,"Effa Louise Manley (née Brooks; March 27, 1897 – April 16, 1981) was an American sports executive. She co-owned the Newark Eagles baseball franchise in the Negro leagues with her husband Abe Manley from 1935 to 1948. Throughout that time, she served as the team's business manager and fulfilled many of her husband's duties as treasurer of the Negro National League. In 2006, she posthumously became the first (and, as of August 2023, only) woman inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, chosen by the Special Committee on Negro Leagues for her work as an executive.


== Early life ==
Manley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she attended school. In 1916, she graduated from Penn Central High School, completing vocational training there in cooking, oral expression and sewing. She entered the hatmaking business.Manley's racial background is not completely known. Her biological parents may have been white but she was raised by her black stepfather and her mother.The racial background of Manley's mother Bertha Cole Brooks (née Ford) is contested. Most books say Bertha was German, Effa claimed her maternal grandfather was Native American, but her maternal grandfather was German.  Bertha is listed as black on many censuses and documents, however, this could have been due to census takers and biases. No African ancestry has been proven conclusively.Most assumed Manley's stepfather was her biological father and therefore classify her as black. However, according to the book The Most Famous Woman in Baseball by Bob Luke, Effa was born through an extramarital union between her seamstress mother, Bertha Ford Brooks, and Bertha's white employer, Philadelphia stockbroker John Marcus Bishop. Daryl Russell Grigsby wrote, ""...some insist she was a white woman exposed to black culture, who identified as black. Regardless of her ethnic origins, Effa Manley thought of herself as a black woman and was perceived by all who knew her as just that."": p.55  Author Ted Schwarz wrote, ""She was a white woman who passed as a black...She could stay in any hotel she desired.""In an interview she gave, she seemed to enjoy the confusion her skin color created. She related a story of when her husband, Abe Manley took her to Tiffany's in New York for an engagement ring. She picked out a huge five-carat stone. She remarked at how every salesgirl in the store was on hand to get a glimpse of this ""old Negro man buying this young white girl a five-carat ring"" and how she got a kick out of it. In 1977, Manley was interviewed for an oral history project which is archived at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries.


== Newark Eagles ==
She married Abe Manley in 1935 after meeting him at a New York Yankees game, and he involved her extensively in the operation of his own club, the Newark Eagles in Newark, New Jersey. She displayed particular skill in the area of marketing and often scheduled promotions that advanced the Civil Rights Movement. Her most noteworthy success was the Eagles' victory in the Negro World Series in 1946. She worked to improve the condition of the players in the entire league. She advocated better scheduling, pay, and accommodations. Her players traveled in an air-conditioned Flxible Clipper bus, considered extravagant for the Negro leagues.
She took over day-to-day business operations of the team, arranged playing schedules, planned the team's travel, managed and met the payroll, bought the equipment, negotiated contracts, and handled publicity and promotions. Thanks to her rallying efforts, more than 185 VIPs—including New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who threw out the first pitch, and Charles C. Lockwood, justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York—were on hand to watch the Eagles' inaugural game in 1935.
Among the Eagles players during her ownership were future major league stars such as Larry Doby, who in 1947 was the first player to integrate the American League, Monte Irvin, and Don Newcombe. Manley was critical of Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey, who signed Jackie Robinson to a minor league contract in 1945. She felt Negro league teams were justified in requesting compensation for players who were signed to major league contracts (Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck did pay her $10,000 compensation for Doby's contract, with another $5,000 when he stayed on the Indians roster). Manley was also critical of Negro league fans who supported Rickey because they felt he was integrating the major leagues due to civil rights causes rather than her summation of Rickey seeking business opportunity for his motivation.: p.58  She also was critical of Robinson when he talked of the disorganization of the Negro leagues, asking him to not forget his beginnings and the contributions the Negro leagues had made to the game.: p.57–58 


== Activism ==
Her influence extended beyond baseball; she was active in the Civil Rights Movement and a social activist. Before the civil rights movement, Manley supported ""Don't Buy Where You Can't Work"" boycotts. As part of her work for the Citizens' League for Fair Play, Manley organized a 1934 boycott of stores that refused to hire black salesclerks. After six weeks, the owners of the store (Blumstein's Department Store) gave in, and by the end of 1935 some 300 stores on 125th Street employed black clerks. Manley was the treasurer of the Newark chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and often used Eagles games to promote civic causes.
In 1939 she held an ""Anti-Lynching Day"" at Ruppert Stadium, selling buttons that read “Stop Lynching” to support efforts to pass federal anti-lynching legislation. During World War II she arranged for entertainers to perform for segregated Black troops stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey when they were barred from segregated USO clubs and canteens.At this time most blacks were barred from practicing medicine. The Booker T. Washington Community Hospital, which offered training for black doctors and nurses, opened due in a large part to money raised from the Newark Eagles. They played numerous benefit games to raise money for new medical equipment. They also raised money for black Elks lodges, a major part of urban black social life. The Eagles worked especially hard for groups that promoted the welfare of Newark's black population. In an exhibit honoring the Negro leagues at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, there is a banner given to the team by the Newark Student Camp Fund in recognition of their efforts to help the community.
Another example of the relationship Effa helped forge with the community was copying a practice of another team which allowed the city's youth to attend games for free. Some children could afford the ten-cent fare for the bus ride while others jump on the back of a moving bus to take advantage of the free ballgames. Because of Effa Manley, the Newark Eagles were as important to black Newark as the Dodgers were to Brooklyn.
Manley and Leon Hardwick wrote Negro Baseball ... Before Integration. In addition to covering the Negro leagues from 1935 to 1960, parts of the book are autobiographical.


== Legacy ==
She was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in February 2006. She was the first woman named to the Hall of Fame.In 2010, her life was the subject of a children's book, She Loved Baseball: The Effa Manley Story, written by Audrey Vernick and illustrated by Don Tate.


== Personal life ==
Manley was married four times and had no children. Her first husband was George Bush, a chauffeur whom she had met in Atlantic City, New Jersey and married in 1920; they later divorced. Her second husband was Abe Manley to whom she was married from 1933 till his death in 1952. She was married Henry Moton Clinton from December 1953 to August 1954 and to Charles Wesley Alexander from 1956 to 1957; Manley stated that she regretted both her marriages after her second one.


=== Death ===
By the spring of 1981, Manley's health had deteriorated to the point that she could no longer live in her apartment. She moved into a rest home run by former Negro league player Quincy Trouppe. Manley told Trouppe that she would go to the hospital to get checked out. She had cancer of the colon, which progressed into peritonitis after surgery. Manley had a heart attack and died on April 16, 1981, having never returned to the rest home. She died just four days after boxer Joe Louis, her sports idol, who had been one of the most influential black athletes of that time. Manley was buried in Culver City at the Holy Cross Cemetery.

7,"Minnie Lichtenstein Marcus (October 4, 1882 – December 5, 1979) was an American businesswoman who was CEO of department store Neiman Marcus, co-founded by her husband Herbert Marcus.


== Biography ==
Born as Minnie Liechtenstein in Dallas, Texas, her father Meyer Lichtenstein had emigrated from Königsberg, Germany, whilst her mother Hattie Mittenthal had come from Russia via Peoria, Illinois. She married Herbert Marcus in 1902 and gave birth to the first of their four sons, Stanley Marcus, in 1905.  
The Marcus family and the newly married Carrie Marcus Neiman and Abraham Lincoln Neiman, who were her sister in law and her husband then moved to Atlanta, Georgia to do sales promotion work. The Coca-Cola Company and other clients brought in substantial income but Minnie and others became homesick for Dallas.  The Neiman and Marcus families relinquished sales territories in the nascent soft drink concern for $25,000 which they used to found Neiman Marcus, which initially specialized in ready-to-wear women's finery, in Dallas in 1907.Minnie gave birth to her subsequent three sons, Edward, Herbert Jr., and Lawrence, in roughly four year intervals. In 1928, she and her husband took an extensive trip to Europe while her son Stanley worked with Mr. Neiman and an expanding group of employees in the constantly growing enterprise.  After their return, they discovered that her son Stanley and A. L. Neiman had clashed on many issues and that Carrie had been told first hand about her husband's marital infidelities.  Minnie's sister in law asked for a divorce and Herbert officially made a decision to take a loan to buy out the Neiman share for $250,000 in return for Mr. Neiman being legally barred from competing with Neiman Marcus in Dallas in the future.
The World War II years brought duties to Neiman Marcus the store as rationing and other realities set in and to Minnie's sons via the Selective Service System and other government programs.  Lawrence was injured in Africa and Stanley joined the War Production Board to help the war efforts with his knowledge about clothing and business in general.

After graduating from Columbia University, Mason joined Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton and worked there for one year. In 1999, she joined the Robin Hood Foundation as Managing Director.

== Criticism ==
Mason has often been criticized for her role in the high-profile dispute between the Malaysian government and the heirs of the Sulu Sultanate. She has been said to have links to global legal financing firms like Therium and Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook, both of which are said to have interests in the oil-rich Sabah region. Therium provided third-party litigation funding to the heirs of the Sulu Sultanate, an amount which Reuters confirmed was about $20 million. Separately, a Euronews report said, “Elisabeth Mason, another lawyer representing the Sulu heirs, works closely with executives from tech giants Google and Facebook. Famously, both have been accused of backing organizations involved in climate denial and making millions from ads for ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell or entities like The American Petroleum Institute.”In April 2023 Maurizio Geri wrote in Real Clear Defence that “there can be little doubt then that as long as Malaysia refuses to budge on exemptions for foreign vessels operating in Sabah and continues to move in a pro-China direction on digital infrastructure, major American tech firms may well have an underlying interest in undermining federal control over Sabah”.Geri wrote that Mason’s close proximity to “US tech giants raises the question of whether the lawsuit representing the Sulu heirs is linked to interests with a much larger stake in the geopolitical rivalry unfolding in the Asia-Pacific over control of the region’s data networks”. The report adds that funding for Mason’s Stanford Poverty and Technology Lab “came specifically from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the main philanthropic initiative run by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife”.


== International presence ==
Mason - and Paul Cohen of the British law firm 4-5 Gray's Inn Square - was the lead co-counsel for claimants in the high-profile Malaysia-Sulu arbitration case. The claimants proclaimed themselves as the heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu and demanded compensation from the Malaysian government for a colonial-era agreement it stopped honouring in 2013.
The claimants sought US$32 billion from the Malaysian government in lost revenue on account of allegedly violating the colonial era agreement. As the agreement involved Great Britain until at least 1946, the claimants first approached the UK for intervention. After UK's refusal, the claimants approached the Madrid High Court to appoint an arbitrator. The court subsequently appointed Gonzalo Stampa as the sole arbitrator on May 22, 2019.
The Madrid High Court of Justice of Madrid later annulled the arbitrator’s appointment on June 29, 2021. However, Stampa termed it ‘an unauthorised local–court intrusion’ and moved the arbitration seat from Madrid to Paris. The arbitrator rendered his final award in Paris, ordering Malaysia to pay US$14.9 billion in compensation to the claimants. On June 6, the Paris Court of Appeal declared that the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdiction over the case, annulling the $14.9bn award by Stampa. He is now facing criminal charges in Spain for contempt of court and professional intrusion before the Madrid Criminal Investigating Court No 40.

15,"Dame Natalie Sara Massenet,  (née Rooney; born 13 May 1965) is a British-American fashion entrepreneur and former journalist, who founded the designer fashion portal Net-a-Porter. From 2013 to 2017, she was the chairman of the British Fashion Council. In 2018 alongside Nick Brown, she co-founded Imaginary Ventures and became non executive co-chairman at Farfetch.Credited by many as changing the way designer fashion is retailed, she has been described by The Observer as: ""fashion's favourite self-made success story"".


== Background and early career ==
Natalie Massenet, née Natalie Sara Rooney, was born in Los Angeles on 13 May 1965, the daughter of American journalist-turned-film publicist Robert “Bob” L. Rooney and Barbara Jones, a British model for Chanel, and film stand-in for Sophia Loren. She spent her early childhood in Paris, moving back to Los Angeles in 1976 with her father, after her parents divorced.Her first job after graduating from high school was in a menswear shop in Los Angeles and Massenet then attended UCLA, studying English Literature. After graduating, she spent a year in Tokyo working as a fashion model and stylist. Other early jobs included working as a receptionist at Universal Studios and assisting at Italian magazine Moda, where she worked with the then-emerging photographer Mario Testino.Massenet began her career as a fashion journalist at Women's Wear Daily (WWD) in 1993. She then moved on to Tatler in the UK, where she worked as assistant to Isabella Blow and her colleagues included Lucy Yeomans. She left to freelance in 1998.


== Net-a-Porter ==
Massenet founded Net-a-Porter in 2000 in London as a website in magazine format for selling designer fashion. The idea came about after Massenet was attempting to source products online for a fashion shoot. The business was launched from Massenet's flat in Chelsea and she raised the £1.2m start-up costs with the help of her then-husband, French hedge fund manager Arnaud Massenet. Initially the business operation was so low-key that Net-a-Porter's trademark black delivery boxes were stacked up in the bath.The concept behind the site was to be able to click on an image of an outfit within a magazine format and buy it. In an interview for The Wall Street Journal, Massenet said that she'd walked away from her dream career in journalism to take the idea forward and it took her several years to realise that she had created a magazine format for the 21st century. Initially, the idea of selling high fashion online was unappealing to designers and investors, who couldn't imagine selling goods without a physical retail outlet, however in 2001 Massenet persuaded Roland Mouret to sell his first collection via the site. By 2004, the company was profitable and won the best fashion shop award at the British Fashion Awards.The company launched a fashion discount site The Outnet in 2009 and in 2010 Massenet sold Net-a-Porter to Swiss luxury goods holding company Richemont for a figure estimated at £50m, remaining involved with the company as executive chairman and an investor. In 2011, a menswear site Mr Porter was established; beauty was added to the site in early 2013 under the leadership of David Olsen.As of September 2013, Net-a-Porter employed 2,600 people in the UK, US and Hong Kong, with further offices in Shanghai and fulfilment centres on the outskirts of three cities. Net-a-Porter Group is now estimated as a £350m company.In early 2014, it launched a print magazine called Porter, with an associated app and digital version of the magazine.Ahead of a merger with the Yoox Group, Massenet stepped down as the executive chairman of Net-a-Porter in September 2015.


== After Net-a-Porter ==
Massenet took over as chairman of the British Fashion Council in 2013. In this honorary role, which normally carries a three-year commitment, she is responsible for steering London Fashion Week and overseeing the Council's other activities to promote British fashion design in the UK and overseas. An article in 2013, suggested she has boosted London's reputation as an international fashion centre. She stepped down of her role in May 2018, replaced by Stephanie Phair, Chief Strategy Officer at Farfetch.
Massenet is still very much involved in online luxury as she's joined the online luxury platform, Farfetch in February 2017 as non executive co-chairman. On the day of the announcement, Jose Neves very enthusiastically said ""I have always been a huge huge fan of Natalie. She was a pioneer that started this whole thing for the rest of us. I’ve always had huge admirations. I actually found that the thought was actually mutual. She loved the Farfetch model and the brand DNA. She got more and more excited about the business.""She also co-founded Imaginary Ventures in 2018 with Nick Brown, formerly of 14W Ventures. Imaginary is a Venture Capital Fund that invests in early–stage opportunities at the intersection of retail and technology in Europe and the US. They've already invested in millennial beauty brand Glossier created by Emily Weiss, Khloe Kardashian’s denim company Good American, sustainable US label Reformation, tights company Heist, cosmetic dermatology brand Ever/Body, pop up retail company Appear Here and many more.She has been extensively renovating the listed Donhead House in Wiltshire, with Erik Torstensson since she purchased it for £1.4 million in 2014. Philip Joseph was responsible for the interior renovation of the property.

18,"Jessica O. Matthews is a Nigerian-American inventor, Founder, CEO and venture capitalist. She is the co-founder of Uncharted, which made Soccket, a soccer ball that can be used as a portable power generator. Matthews attended Harvard College and graduated from Harvard Business School. In 2011, Fortune named her one of its ""10 Most Powerful Women Entrepreneurs"" and in 2015, named her as one of it ""Most Promising Women Entrepreneurs"". In 2012, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations named her ""Scientist of the Year."" Matthews is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria. The President of Nigeria named her an ""Ambassador for Entrepreneurship"" for the country.


== Early life ==
Matthews was born on February 13, 1988, and grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York, as a dual citizen of the United States and Nigeria. She is the second of four children. Her parents run a software business, Decision Technologies International and her sister, Tiana Idoni-Matthews, became a marketing director of Uncharted Play. Matthews attended Our Lady of Lourdes High School, as a teenager pursuing science fairs and track and field. Matthews then attended Harvard College where she majored in Economics and later Harvard Business School.


== Career ==


=== Uncharted Play ===
As a junior in college in 2008, Matthews and classmate Julia Silverman invented Soccket as part of an assignment for an engineering class. She has described the inspiration for the invention as coming from an experience attending her aunt's wedding in Nigeria. When the electricity was lost and diesel generators were used to keep the lights on, Matthews recognized the health hazard posed from fumes and decided to try to do something about it. She and Silverman presented Soccket as their proposed solution, a soccer ball that stores kinetic energy as it's used. A half-hour of play with the soccer ball generates enough energy to power a small, attachable LED light for three hours, so that play with soccer ball also provides children a reading light with which to do their homework after dark. The two founded Uncharted Power to develop Soccket, with Matthews becoming CEO.After graduating from college in 2010, Matthews took a full-time job working at a crowd-funding company called CrowdTap. The following year, she left that company to work on Uncharted Power full-time, initially raising funds through Kickstarter and then utilizing convertible debt. That same year, she presented Soccket at the Clinton Global Initiative University and on President Barack Obama's 2013 trip to Tanzania. The company also makes a jump rope that stores energy in a means similar to Soccket called the Pulse, which generates three hours of power for an LED through 15 minutes of jumping rope.The initial manufacturing run of Soccket encountered significant quality control issues, so Matthews moved production to Uncharted Play's own facilities in New York. She subsequently shifted the company's focus to developing a broader range of kinetic-energy-storing products in partnership with experienced manufacturers. This shift included trademarking MORE, an acronym for Motion-based Off-Grid Renewable Energy, a system which uses Soccket's energy-storing method in consumer products beyond toys. ""Matthews describes her company's proprietary MORE technology as an energy harvesting and emanating building block that can be seamlessly integrated into various infrastructures, objects and products — everything from floor panels, streets, speedbumps and sidewalks, to subway turnstiles, strollers, shopping carts and beyond.""


=== Uncharted Power ===
In 2016, Uncharted Power had been profitable for three consecutive years and doubled gross profit margins year by year. In 2016, Matthews raised $7 million in Series A funding for Uncharted Power, with the company valued at $57 million. TechCrunch reported that this made Matthews the 13th black female founder to have raised more than $1 million in funding. By March 2017, 500,000 Socckets and Pulses had been used in developing regions, primarily in Africa and Latin America.
In 2016, when Matthews moved Uncharted Power to Harlem, New York, she created a non-profit arm, the Harlem Tech Fund (HTF), which aims to support 100 new startups and offer technology training to 10,000 Harlem residents over the next two to five years. Matthews serves as chairman of the board of HTF. In the same year, she was recognized at the Harlem Economic Development Day, receiving the Outstanding Corporate Diversity Award.


=== Other ===
Matthews has expanded to work on global infrastructure projects. She is co-founder and executive director of KDDC, developing a hydropower dam project in Nigeria. The 30-megawatt dam is among the first hydroelectric dam projects privatized in Nigeria. In 2021, she was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Energy to the U.S. Department of Energy's Electricity Advisory Committee (EAC).


== Recognition ==
Matthews has received numerous awards, honors and recognition. In 2013, she was named ""Innovator of the Year"" by Black Enterprise, and was recognised as both one of Forbes 30 Under 30 and Inc.'s 30 under 30 in 2014 and 2016 respectively, and selected twice by Fortune for recognition.

20,"Marissa Ann Mayer (; born May 30, 1975) is an American business executive and investor who served as president and chief executive officer of Yahoo! from 2012 to 2017. She was a long-time executive, usability leader and key spokesperson for Google (employee No. 20). Mayer later co-founded Sunshine, a startup technology company.In January 2017, Yahoo! announced that Mayer would end her employment by that company and would resign from its board of directors following the sale of the company's operating business to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion. She did not join the newly combined company, now called Yahoo Inc. (formerly Verizon Media and prior to that Oath), and she announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.


== Early life ==
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, an art teacher of Finnish descent, and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies. Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years. She has a younger brother. She would later describe herself as having been ""painfully shy"" as a child and teenager.She ""never had fewer than one after-school activity per day,"" participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debates, and the Brownies. During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her ""criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence"". At an early age, she showed an interest in mathematics and science.


== Education ==


=== Wausau West High School ===
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team. She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics. She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up. During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk. After graduating from high school in 1993, Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.


=== Stanford University ===
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her concentration to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer. Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997, and an MS in computer science in 1999. For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.


=== Illinois Institute of Technology ===
In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland. She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.


== Career ==


=== Google (1999–2012) ===
After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers, including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company. She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20. She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings. She became known for her attention to detail, which helped land her a promotion to product manager, and later she became director of consumer web products. She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage. She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an advertising platform that allows businesses to show their product to relevant potential customers based on their search terms. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship initiative to recruit new talents and cultivate them for leadership roles. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, where they took on extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes. Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein. In 2005, Mayer became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience. Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services. In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million. While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School. She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.


=== Yahoo! (2012–2017) ===
On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She was also a member of the company's board of directors. At the time of her appointment, Yahoo's numbers had been falling behind those of Google for over a year and the company had been through several top management changes. To simplify the bureaucratic process and ""make the culture the best version of itself"", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles. Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the ban on remote work. In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents. CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google. Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition. In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%. In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment. However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired. Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory. In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list, and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication. In March 2016 Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders. Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO. Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo. By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters. In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business. In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017. In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options. On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture. Over Mayer's tenure, the number of monthly visits on Yahoo's home page dropped from nearly 10 billion to less than 4.5 while Google's increased from 17 billion to over 56.On November 8, 2017, along with several other present and former corporate CEOs, Mayer testified before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding major security breaches at Yahoo during 2013 and 2014.


==== Allegations of gender-based discrimination ====
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that ""Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of an employee performance-rating system to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees."" He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received ""fully satisfactory"" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired. This case was dismissed in March 2018.An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.


=== Sunshine (2018–present) ===
After leaving Yahoo! in 2017, Mayer started Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Munoz Torres. The company is based in Palo Alto and is focused on artificial intelligence and consumer media. On November 18, 2020, Mayer announced that Lumi Labs would be rebranded as Sunshine at the same time as she announced its first product: Sunshine Contacts. Sunshine Contacts claims to improve users' iPhone contacts and Google contacts using intelligent algorithms, contact data, public sources, and more.


== Boards ==
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart, Maisonette, and Jawbone, Mayer also previously served or sits on several non-profit boards, such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted, live video platform Airtime.com, wireless power startup uBeam, online DIY community and e-commerce company Brit + Co., mobile payments processor Square, home décor site One Kings Lane, genetic testing company Natera, and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.


== Accolades ==
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14, 8 and 16 respectively. In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed.

Mayer briefly dated Larry Page in the early 2000s while he was the CEO of Google. Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, in July 2012, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant; she gave birth to a boy on September 30, 2012. Although she asked for baby name suggestions via social media, she eventually chose the name Macallister from an existing list. On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls, Marielle and Sylvana.Mayer is Lutheran, but she has said—referencing Vince Lombardi's ""Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers""—that her priorities are ""God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!.""

Shortly after her marriage, McClintock obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree from San Jose State University in California.In 1963, Al Staples died in an automobile accident. This led to a second marriage, to airplane pilot Fred McClintock, who was a friend of her husband. This marriage shortly ended in a divorce in 1967. Jessica McClintock was a school teacher in Marblehead, Massachusetts, 1966–68 and Long Island, New York, 1968. After the divorce, McClintock and her son Scott moved to San Francisco, California. McClintock continued her career as a school teacher at Nimitz Elementary School in Sunnyvale, California, 1964–65 and 1968–69. On February 16, 2021, Jessica Mcclintock passed away at age 91.


== Career ==
While living in San Francisco, in 1969 McClintock met Eleanor Bailey, who was the head of design and production and looking for investors for Gunne Sax Company, a local dress store. In 1970, McClintock invested $5,000 from her savings and became partners with Bailey, directly in charge of the designing and marketing of the new dress line. Bailey stepped down, leaving McClintock the sole owner of Gunne Sax.
McClintock started with a single-line clothing company and expanded it into a multifaceted outlet targeting international customers looking to purchase bridal, junior and children's designer clothing. McClintock's main design focus was on ""romance."" Her designs sold worldwide, including regions such as the Middle East, Asia and Europe. In 1979, two new clothing lines were created: One was to target girls with the Gunne Sax line, and the other was a secondary contemporary line under the McClintock name/label. Since these two lines became a success, McClintock was able to open her own retail stores. The first Jessica McClintock store was opened in San Francisco in 1981. A year later, Jessica's son, Scott McClintock, joined the company and made two clothing lines that were manufactured under labels of Scott McClintock Dresses and Scott McClintock Sport.

27,"Tara McGowan (born 1985 or 1986) is an American political strategist and journalist. She was the co-founder and CEO of multiple organizations which have been noted for large expenditures on digital advertising in preparation for the 2020 United States presidential election, including the political organization Acronym, the company Lockwood Strategy, and the media company Courier Newsroom. She was the director of the advertising branch of Priorities USA Action, which was the primary super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, and was a digital producer for the re-election campaign of Barack Obama. Previously, she was the press secretary for United States Senator Jack Reed. In 2021, she stepped down from Acronym to build media full-time as head of a new company, Good Information Inc.


== Journalism ==
McGowan began her career as a journalist, working on the CBS program 60 Minutes. After covering the Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign, she left journalism to become the press secretary for Jack Reed, a United States Senator from Rhode Island. During the 2012 United States presidential election, McGowan was a digital producer for Barack Obama's re-election campaign.In 2016, McGowan directed the $42 million digital advertising branch of Priorities USA Action, the primary super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. It was the largest ever ad campaign by the PAC.


== Digital advertising ==
In 2017, McGowan launched the political strategy firm Lockwood Strategy, which Campaigns and Elections identified as a crucial force in Democratic Party victories in the 2017 Virginia elections.Shortly after founding Lockwood Strategy, McGowan co-founded the digital advertising organisation Acronym together with Michael Dubin and with Laurene Powell Jobs and Reid Hoffman's financial backing.  Within just over a year, Acronym had raised tens of millions of dollars for digital advertising campaigns, running more than 100 ad campaigns and registering 60,000 voters.One of McGowan's projects, called Courier Newsroom, is a for-profit media company that produces digital newspapers in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with the aim of filling news deserts in swing states by providing regional news coverage from a left-wing perspective. McGowan's goal of creating a partisan online newsroom is partly intended to combat online fake news, which led The New Yorker to label McGowan ""a starry-eyed techno-utopian"" for her stated belief that digital information is the most effective way to combat digital misinformation.McGowan has been credited with significant innovations in digital political strategy, and has often been described as one of the few progressive strategists to focus specifically on digital media. Joshua Green, writing for Bloomberg News, wrote that McGowan has ""gained notoriety for her outspoken criticism of her party's inability to challenge, or even clearly comprehend, Trump's dominance of the digital landscape"". Similarly, Ozy magazine called her ""The Democrats' most dangerous digital strategist"", with Nick Fouriezos writing that her efforts ""will be one of the major forces shaping the Democrats' general-election fight against Donald Trump"", and Politico referred to her as ""one of the Democratic Party's most in-demand leaders this cycle"". McGowan has also received awards for her work on digital campaigns: she was recognized as a 2018 Rising Star by Campaigns and Elections magazine, and was listed as a ""Name to know"" by Politico.Her work on digital advertising is regularly cited in publications like The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Axios, and her views on digital strategy are frequently quoted in news stories regarding digital advertising campaigns by outlets like The Washington Post, NBC News, and The Hill.

28,"Judith A. McHale (born 1947) is a former under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. Appointed by President Obama, she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 21, 2009, and sworn in on May 26. She resigned effective July 1, 2011.
McHale now serves as the president and chief executive officer of Cane Investments, LLC, a small family-owned fund where her son Brian O'Halloran is the managing director. Cane Investments makes investments in start-ups in the fields of technology and the environment.
McHale is the former president and chief executive officer of Discovery Communications. For two decades, McHale helped build Discovery Communications, the parent company of the Discovery Channel cable channel, into a global media enterprise with 1.4 billion subscribers in 170 countries.


== Early life ==
The daughter of a U.S. Foreign Service officer, McHale was born in New York City and grew up in Britain and apartheid-era South Africa. During these formative years, McHale's family home was said to be constantly under police surveillance and was wire-tapped; family friends were detained and mistreated; and she became close with key anti-apartheid activists, including Felicia Kentridge, who founded South Africa's Legal Resource Centre, and her husband Sydney Kentridge, the noted civil rights lawyer who went on to represent slain anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko.
She is married to Michael O'Halloran and has two sons, Brian and Mark.
Her uncle was the journalist William McHale, Rome Bureau Chief for Time in the 1960s. He died along with Enrico Mattei, a leader of Italian oil company ENI, in a plane crash on October 27, 1962, later classified as a sabotage.


== Education ==
McHale graduated from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and Fordham University School of Law in New York. She has received honorary degrees from the University of Maryland, American University, the University of Miami and Colby College.


== Career ==
In the 1980s, McHale served as general counsel for MTV Networks, overseeing legal affairs for MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1.
In 1987, McHale became general counsel at Discovery Communications, then a small company with a single U.S. cable channel. She went on to serve as chief operating officer, chief executive officer, and president, helping to grow Discovery into a large media company, with more than 100 channels available in 35 languages and distributed to more 1 billion subscribers in over 170 countries. During her tenure as president, Discovery's revenues increased tenfold, with annual revenues topping $3 billion.
McHale and others at Discovery understood something important about communicating with people around the world: It makes more sense to engage people internationally on their own terms, in ways that respect their languages and customs, than it does just to bring them warmed-over versions of American programming. Discovery, nearly alone among American media companies that expanded internationally, put respect for cultural context and local voices at the heart of its business and creative strategies. It modified programming to respect viewers' regional customs and translated – rather than simply subtitled—into 35 different languages.
McHale helped forge strategic partnerships, including an alliance in 1998 with the BBC that enabled a marriage of high-quality content and global distribution strength. Under her leadership the Discovery/BBC joint venture produced numerous documentaries including ""Blue Planet"", ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and the award-winning ""Planet Earth. She also spearheaded numerous corporate acquisitions, including The Learning Channel in 1991 and the Travel Channel in 1997.
As a manager of a rapidly growing company with thousands of employees and offices in 22 countries, McHale made it a priority to create a workplace in which employees thrived professionally and personally. Discovery was consistently named one of the best places to work in various rankings, and, in 2004, McHale was honored by Working Mother magazine as a ""National Family Champion"" for her leadership.
At Discovery, McHale launched education and development initiatives in the United States and around the world, including the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership, which provides free educational programming and technological support to more than a half million students at 200 schools and community centers throughout rural Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
In 2006, after nearly 20 years at Discovery, McHale moved to Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm based in Chevy Chase, MD. McHale worked to launch the GEF/Africa Growth Fund, an investment vehicle intending to focus on supplying expansion capital to small and medium-sized enterprises that provide consumer goods and services in emerging African markets.
Prior to joining the Department of State, McHale served on the boards of directors of Polo/Ralph Lauren, Host Hotels and Resorts and DigitalGlobe, Inc. Ms. McHale currently serves on the boards of directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Ralph Lauren Corporation Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and Yellow Media Limited.


== Public service ==
In 1998, McHale was appointed by Governor Parris Glendening to a four-year term as a member of the Maryland State Board of Education. In September, 2013 McHale was appointed by Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, as chair of the President's Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.
McHale has also provided leadership to a range of organizations engaged in global affairs and development. She served on the boards of the Africa Society of the National Summit on Africa, Africare, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, and Vital Voices. In 2008, she was the co-chair of the Platform Committee of the Democratic National Convention.

Interview"
32,"Linda Marie McMahon (née Edwards; born October 4, 1948) is an American political executive, business executive, and retired performer. She served as the 25th administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.
McMahon, along with her husband, Vince McMahon, founded sports entertainment company Titan Sports, Inc. (today WWE) where she worked as the president and later CEO from 1980 to 2009. During this time, the company grew from a regional business in the northeast to a large multinational corporation. Among other things, she initiated the company's civic programs, Get REAL and Smackdown Your Vote. She made occasional on-screen performances, most notably in a feud with her husband that culminated at WrestleMania X-Seven.
In 2009, McMahon left the WWE to run for a seat in the United States Senate from Connecticut as a Republican, but lost to Democrat Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 general election. She was the Republican nominee for Connecticut's other Senate seat in the 2012 race, but lost to Democrat Chris Murphy.
On December 7, 2016, Donald Trump (president-elect at the time) announced that he would nominate McMahon to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration. The Senate confirmation hearing began on January 24, 2017, and on February 1, her nomination was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship with an 18–1 vote and confirmed by the full Senate on February 14, by a vote of 81–19.
On March 29, 2019, the Trump administration announced McMahon would step down as the administrator of the Small Business Administration to assume new responsibilities within President Trump's reelection campaign, and the resignation took effect on April 12. On April 15, she was named chairwoman of America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC.


== Early life ==
McMahon was born Linda Marie Edwards in New Bern, North Carolina, the daughter of Evelyn and Henry Edwards. She was an only child and grew up as a ""tomboy"" playing basketball and baseball. Her parents were both employees at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, a military base. She grew up in a conservative Baptist family, but converted to Roman Catholicism in her later years.Linda M. Edwards, at the age of 13, met Vince McMahon, then age 16. Her mother worked in the same building as McMahon's mother, but they had not met.
Vince's mother became good friends with the Edwards family, and Vince, who had lived with several abusive stepfathers, enjoyed the feeling of stability that he felt at their home. Edwards and McMahon dated throughout their high school years; she attended Havelock High School and he attended Fishburne Military School in Virginia. During this time, Vince was a ""permanent fixture"" at her home, and spent hours with Linda and her family. He attended East Carolina University, studying business administration. Edwards was an honors student in high school and aspired to become a pediatrician.Shortly after her high school graduation, Vince asked her to marry him. They married on August 26, 1966, when she was 17, and he was 21. She enrolled at East Carolina University in 1966, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in French, and certification to teach. From 1968 to 1971, Vince worked as a traveling cup salesman before joining his father's company, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE). Linda finished college in three years so she could graduate with Vince. Their son Shane was born in 1970, followed by daughter Stephanie in 1976.


== Early career ==
In 1969, the McMahons moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland. McMahon worked as a receptionist at the corporate law firm of Covington & Burling; she translated French documents, trained as a paralegal in the probate department, and studied intellectual property rights.Financially, the couple fared poorly for several years and, despite her husband working 90 hours a week at a quarry, briefly received food stamps. In 1976, after a series of failed business ventures including financing stunt performer Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon Jump, and while pregnant with Stephanie, McMahon and her husband filed for bankruptcy.By 1979, Vince decided to start his own wrestling company. He purchased the Cape Cod Coliseum in Massachusetts and founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. The McMahons held small hockey and other sporting events in addition to wrestling at the Cape Cod Coliseum. At one point, Linda cooked meatball sandwiches to feed the fans at these sporting events. As the company grew, Linda assisted Vince with administration and used her knowledge of intellectual property law to assist in trademark protection for the company. During much of those early years, she had little interest in professional wrestling.In 1982, Vince McMahon purchased Capitol Wrestling, better known as the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from his father. He later expanded his market by airing WWF shows on national television.
In 1983, the McMahons moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. They have six grandchildren.


== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment ==


=== Corporate ===

The McMahons founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. Many workers in the company referred to her as the ""co-chief executive"". McMahon became president in 1993 and CEO of the company in 1997. The company's explosive growth and the way it transformed the wrestling industry caused some observers to label her and Vince ""business geniuses"".One of her major interests in WWF and WWE was product merchandising. She negotiated many of the company's business deals with outside vendors and established the company's first line of action figures, Wrestling Superstars, in 1984. It was a first in the wrestling industry and helped expand the company's popularity with children. She was also the primary negotiator for the World Wrestling Federation's 2000 TV deal with Viacom.During an interview with The Detroit News, when asked what it was like being CEO in a ""testosterone-charged industry,"" McMahon replied, ""It's lots of fun. I'm an only child, so I grew up as my father's son and mother's daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. I really have a very good understanding of the male psyche—I'm very comfortable in a guy environment. I have to say that there are very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It's still a testosterone business, and I like it.""On September 16, 2009, Linda McMahon resigned from her position as CEO of WWE and left WWE to run as a Republican for a seat in the United States Senate from Connecticut. However, she still remains a minority owner of WWE.


==== McMahon's memorandum to Pat Patterson ====
In a 1989 memo to the company's vice president, Pat Patterson, McMahon directed Patterson to fire on-call physician George Zahorian and inform him of imminent legal charges charging him with steroid distribution.
Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea. Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and to tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking.
This memo became known publicly as the ""Tip-Off Memo"" during her campaign for Senate in 2010. It became a political liability used against her in both the nomination and general election campaigns.


==== Federal steroids investigation (2007–2009) ====

Following the murder-suicide of Chris Benoit in 2007, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry. The Committee investigated WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), asking for documentation of their companies' drug policies. The McMahons both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers—roughly 40 percent—had tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for steroids.McMahon was asked why there had been no follow-up during a televised interview with CBS Face the State on January 20, 2010 and responded: ""There's not been any follow-up from any of the inquiries that were made because I believe we had furnished thousands of documents and testimony for them, and I think if they looked at our policy and really delved into it, they would be very satisfied.""


==== PG rating ====

In July 2008, WWE changed its TV parental guidelines rating from TV-14 to TV-PG. In December 2008, at a UBS Media Conference, McMahon described the new rating as a marketing strategy to attract a young generation of wrestling fans and create loyalty to the brand. Due to the TV-PG rating, chair shots to the head were banned, as well as sex scenes, blood, and vulgar language.


==== Company legacy ====
During the 1980s, the WWF successfully overcame considerable opposition and some media ridicule in lobbying for deregulation in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas. By 2000, fewer than half of the 50 states had athletic regulations on the wrestling industry.Following common practice in professional sports, WWE classifies its wrestlers as independent contractors rather than employees. The classification allowed the company to avoid paying Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance for wrestlers. McMahon stated the WWE wrestlers had lucrative contracts, merchandising deals, royalty payments, and appearance fees. She noted that many of the wrestlers had agents and considered them to be on par with ""singers, golfers, or tennis players"". The company offered seminars to help wrestlers select health insurance plans.Under McMahon's tenure, WWE became one of the largest recipients of special tax credits for film and TV production granted by the state of Connecticut.During her 2010 campaign, Blumenthal's campaign criticized her and WWE for accepting the tax credits while laying off workers in 2009.


=== On-screen roles ===
McMahon often referred to the creative side of WWE as Vince's specialty, stating that she was primarily in the management team, although she appeared in several storylines. McMahon debuted on WWF TV during the Corporate Ministry storyline, on the May 3, 1999, episode of Raw during the Attitude Era. During an interview with Fox News, she said that she often did not know what the storylines were in advance and watched events unfold as the general public did.


=== Charitable work ===
Through WWE, the McMahons were major donors to The Donald J. Trump Foundation, giving $4 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2009. The McMahons donated over $8 million in 2008 to the Fishburne Military School, Sacred Heart University, and East Carolina University. Nonprofit Quarterly noted the majority of the McMahons' donations were towards capital expenditures. In 2006, they paid $2.5 million for construction of a tennis facility in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. As of 2010, she served on the board of the Close Up Foundation, a nonprofit which offers youth field trips to Washington, D.C.


==== Get R.E.A.L. ====
McMahon launched the company's Get R.E.A.L. program to deliver positive messages about education to young adults. The program encouraged literacy through public service announcements, posters, and bookmarks featuring wrestling superstars. In 2000, the American Library Association reported the WWF's Know Your Role poster was its highest-selling poster for two straight months. Since 2006, thousands of posters featuring WWE superstars have been distributed to libraries and reading facilities.


==== SmackDown! Your Vote campaign ====
McMahon initiated WWE's non-partisan voter registration campaign, ""SmackDown! Your Vote"", in August 2000. The campaign targeted the 18-to-30 voter demographic, and made use of online marketing, public service announcements, and youth voting partnerships. The campaign, which registered 150,000 new voters during the 2000 election, was started in coalition with MTV's Choose or Lose, Project Vote Smart, and Youth Vote 2000. As of the 2008 election, it listed 14 voter registration partner organizations. During the 2008 presidential election, Smackdown your Vote! registered many voters online, often in affiliation with Rock the Vote.


==== Special Olympics ====
The McMahons began supporting the Special Olympics in 1986. McMahon first developed an interest in the Olympics from her friendship with NBC producer Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James, who encouraged them to participate in the mid-1980s.She met Lowell Weicker, whose son is developmentally-disabled, through the Special Olympics. In 1995, as Connecticut Governor, Weicker appointed Linda McMahon to the Governor's Council for the World Special Olympics.


==== Achievements ====
McMahon became a member of the board of trustees of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut in November 2004. She supported many organizations, including the USO, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, the Starlight Foundation, and Community Mayors. In 2005, she won appointment to The Make-A-Wish Foundation of America National Advisory Council and received the Arthur M. Sackler Award from the Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra for WWE's support of its arts education program.On January 29, 2007, Multichannel News named McMahon to its class of ""Wonder Women"" for 2007. The award recognized her outstanding contributions to the cable and telecommunications industries. In May 2007, she appeared as the keynote speaker at the Girl Scout Council of Southwestern Connecticut's Women of Achievement Leadership Breakfast. McMahon was a Girl Scout.Under her leadership, WWE was the recipient of the USO of Metropolitan Washington's first ever ""Legacy of Hope"" award for its extensive support of U.S. troops and the USO's Operation Care Package program. In 2007, the company received the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Public Service Award for its support of deployed service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the company received the GI Film Festival's Corporate Patriot Award.On April 13, 2012, Sacred Heart University officially dedicated and opened the Linda E. McMahon Commons Building on its main campus in Fairfield, Connecticut.


== Political career ==


=== Connecticut Board of Education ===
McMahon was appointed to the State Board of Education by Governor Jodi Rell in January 2009.She went through a confirmation process in the Connecticut State Assembly where she was questioned on her record as CEO of WWE. The State Senate approved her nomination by a vote of 34–1 and the House by 96–45 with some opponents expressing concerns that the nature of her WWE activities would send the wrong message. State representative Bruce Morris claimed she lacked ""depth of knowledge regarding education"". However, state representative John Hetherington said it ""would be good to have someone outside the establishment on the board"".On April 1, 2010, McMahon resigned from the State Board of Education, because state law does not allow board members to solicit campaign contributions.


=== 2010 U.S. Senate campaign ===

On September 16, 2009, McMahon announced her candidacy for U.S. Senator to represent the state of Connecticut. She announced she would spend up to $50 million of her own money to finance her campaign and refused outside donations, the third most ever spent on a senatorial campaign. She ran for the Republican nomination, campaigning on promises of lower taxes, fiscal conservatism, and job creation. She campaigned as socially moderate, and identified herself as pro-choice while also opposing partial-birth abortion and federal funding for abortions. Her mail, radio, television, and Internet advertisements quickly gained name recognition and strong poll numbers over her opponents.
McMahon's spending became a key argument of one of her rivals, former Congressman Rob Simmons, who accused her of ""buying the election"". McMahon and Simmons engaged in a frequently bitter contest. At the party convention, McMahon received the most support, but Simmons received enough votes to qualify for the ballot for the August 10 primary, although he was not actively campaigning. In late July—two weeks before the primary—Simmons relaunched his campaign by airing ads on TV reminding voters that his name would be on the ballot, participating in debates, and accepting interviews with editorial boards. A third candidate, Peter Schiff, qualified for the ballot by submitting petition signatures. McMahon defeated her opponents and faced Richard Blumenthal in the general election, losing by 11%.


=== 2012 U.S. Senate campaign ===

Immediately after her loss to Blumenthal, McMahon hinted she would run again for Senate in 2012. McMahon maintained a high profile following the election, running television ads, campaigning for politicians, and making frequent media appearances. When Joe Lieberman announced he would retire from the U.S. Senate, she became the Republican Party favorite for the 2012 election.On September 20, 2011, in Southington, Connecticut, McMahon officially announced her candidacy. On May 18, 2012, McMahon earned the endorsement of the state Republican Party at the Connecticut State Republican Convention by a delegate vote of 658 to 351 over the next-highest candidate, former congressman Chris Shays. The two were the only candidates to qualify for the primary, which took place on August 14, 2012. McMahon defeated Shays by a three-to-one margin, spending $15.7 million of her money on the campaign. She lost to Democratic U.S. Representative Chris Murphy in the general election, marking her second consecutive defeat.


=== Political contributions ===
Following her election defeats, McMahon committed herself to becoming a major Republican fundraiser and donor. She donated to groups such as American Crossroads and Ending Spending Fund, and associated with fellow mega donor Paul Singer.As the 2016 Republican nomination process began to gear up in early 2015, McMahon, Singer, and Charles R. Schwab were among donors and prospective-candidate representatives who attended a daylong meeting near Jackson, Wyoming, that was hosted by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his son Todd, and featured ""several Republican donors who favor[ed] same-sex marriage and immigration reform"".After Donald Trump made an appearance at WrestleMania 23 in 2007, the McMahons donated $5 million to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in addition to the payment for the appearance. In 2016, McMahon donated $6 million to Rebuilding America Now, a Super PAC with the purpose of electing Donald Trump as US president, and in 2015 and 2016 combined, $1.2 million to Future 45, a Super PAC which funded anti-Bernie Sanders advertisements.


=== Small Business Administration ===
On December 7, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate McMahon to be the administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA).
With her pending nomination to become administrator of the SBA, examination of McMahon's record in preparation for her facing United States Senate confirmation began. In December she received media attention including from The Wall Street Journal, which noted that ""[a]s part of her 2012 campaign, [the nominee's] economic plan called for getting rid of 'outdated/ineffective and duplicative programs,' and expressed support for a 2012 proposal by President Barack Obama to merge the SBA, the Commerce Department's core functions and four other entities into one unit"". The merger proposal, which did not proceed far toward approval at the time, would have eliminated the Cabinet-level post to which McMahon was nominated. The Connecticut Post of Bridgeport, Connecticut, examined issues of potential conflicts of interest from remaining WWE stock holdings and other financial assets, as well as of the relationship between WWE and smaller businesses in the wrestling world, with critics and supporters cited. The Hill provided a venue for two industry representatives to specify how they hoped McMahon would reform the agency she'd been tapped to lead.The Senate confirmation hearing began on January 24, 2017; her nomination was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on February 1, 2017, with an 18–1 vote, and confirmed by the full Senate on February 14, 2017, by a vote of 81–19. She was officially sworn in as administrator of the SBA on February 14, 2017.On June 17, 2017, in an interview with CNBC, McMahon stated in her role as administrator of SBA that she is ""[l]earning how to develop business plans, how to grow, how to pitch [one's] business when [one is] trying to get investors, or to move into a different market and those are aspects of SBA that are not as well known"", as the main goals of the SBA are capital, counseling, contracts and disaster relief. She also stated that the goals were being challenged, as the agency faced a five percent budget cut and future restructuring. “What we have done is look inside SBA, and what I have found is there are some duplicative programs that we are going to be merging.”
Later in 2017, she visited 68 cities to hear from small business owners and to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 backed by President Trump. On McMahon's first anniversary as head of the SBA, on January 29, 2018, The Washington Post said the SBA's progress under McMahon had been ""so far, so good"" and credited her with improving the SBA's offices' emergency call centers in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, hiring an additional 3,000 people to work them, and revamping the administration's online presence.On March 29, 2019, McMahon announced her resignation as administrator of the SBA to chair America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC. The resignation took effect on April 12, 2019.


=== Campaign finance ===
America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC chaired by McMahon, helped raise $83 million for Trump's reelection campaign in 2020. McMahon also serves as chair of the board for America First Policy Institute, along with Vice Chair Larry Kudlow, former director of the National Economic Council under Trump and Fox Business host.

== U.S. Geological Survey ==


=== Appointment ===
In July 2009, McNutt was announced as President Obama's nominee to be the next director of the United States Geological Survey and science adviser to the United States Secretary of the Interior. The Senate unanimously approved her nomination on October 21. She was the first woman to lead the USGS since its establishment in 1879. Secretary Ken Salazar endorsed McNutt for the position. In a television interview following Obama's announcement, McNutt said:

Many other countries are far ahead of the U.S., in installing wind farms, installing solar panels, moving to alternate energies, and in preparing their populations for the decision-making necessary to cope with climate change.


=== BP oil spill ===
During her first year, four major events impacted USGS in quick succession: a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti, an 8.0 earthquake in Chile, the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull and the BP oil spill.In May 2010, McNutt headed the Flow Rate Technical Group which attempted to measure the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Preliminary reports from the group said that the rate of the oil spill was at least twice and possibly up to five times as much as previously acknowledged. Subsequent estimates, based on six independent methodologies, were four times the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. A refined estimate based on new pressure readings, data, and analysis, released by the United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and McNutt in August, said that 4.9 million barrels (with uncertainty of plus or minus approximately 10 percent) of oil had leaked from the well until it was capped on July 15. The disaster was the largest ever accidental spill of oil into marine waters.In a two-day deposition during October 2012, McNutt was questioned by lawyers for BP, for the Justice Department, for plaintiffs, and for the Gulf states. Subject to approval by U.S. federal courts, BP agreed to a settlement in November 2012 in which the company pleaded guilty to felony charges of misconduct or neglect concerning eleven deaths at the explosion site. The company agreed to pay US$4.5 billion including US$1.256 billion in criminal fines. As of 2012, BP may still be liable for US$5.4 to US$31 billion in civil fines under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act.


=== Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ===
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) filed a lawsuit against the Department of the Interior and a complaint about a NOAA scientist in the Flow Rate Technical Group which McNutt led. The group felt that government scientists understated the flow rate of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.


=== USGS peer review process ===
McNutt participated in the reversal of a 2006 USGS policy that required agency scientists to submit their work to two internal reviewers and obtain a sign-off from a higher level official before submitting their work to external journals who then applied their own peer-review process. Scientists can now have both internal and external reviews simultaneously and the internal process is reduced to one internal review plus sign-off by the USGS Office of Science Quality and Integrity.


=== Afghan mineral wealth ===
In September 2011, a USGS team including Jack H. Medlin, Said Mirzad, Stephen G. Peters and Robert D. Tucker published a report which they presented at the Afghan embassy in Washington, DC, detailing 57 information packages about Areas of Interest (AOIs) that total at least 1,000,000 metric tons of untapped mineral deposits they have found in Afghanistan. Scientific American speculated that replacing ""opium and Taliban strongholds with a mining bonanza"" could ""change U.S. foreign policy and world stability"". This report, which points to resources that The New York Times said in 2010 were worth $1 trillion, was put into the public domain. McNutt said at the time:
There is always increased risk for commercial ventures investing in new mining facilities in frontier areas such as Afghanistan, but by putting our information on the locations and estimated quantities and grades of ores in the public domain, we lower that risk, spurring progress.


=== Map of Jupiter's moon Io ===
In 2011 and online in 2012, USGS released a geologic surface map of Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in our solar system, about twenty-five times more active than earth. David Williams of Arizona State University was the project lead. The maps are made of the best images from NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 missions (acquired in 1979) as well as the spacecraft Galileo (1995–2003) named for Galileo Galilei who discovered Jupiter's moons in 1610. McNutt said:
More than 130 years after the USGS first began producing quality geologic maps here on Earth, it is exciting to have the reach of our science extend across 400 million miles to this volcanically active moon of Jupiter. Somehow it makes the vast expanse of space seem less forbidding to know that similar geologic processes which have shaped our planet are active elsewhere.


=== Animal extinction and disease ===
In 2012, USGS declared the blue-tailed skink named Emoia impar extinct because none have been observed in their home the Hawaiian Islands since the 1960s. McNutt, quoted by John Platt for Scientific American, said:

No other landscape in these United States has been more impacted by extinction events and species invasions in historic times than the Hawaiian Islands, with as-yet unknown long-term cascading consequences to the ecosystem.
In a press release, McNutt introduced a lecture by David Blehert, a USGS research scientist, speaking on white nose syndrome which may afflict six species of North American bats and may have ""far-reaching ecological consequences"":
...they are in a race against time to find a way to manage this scourge before it is too late for these under-appreciated little mammals.
McNutt commented on work by lead researcher Carol Meteyer and others from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center and the National Institutes of Health in November 2012:

...The potential discovery of IRIS in bats infected with white-nose syndrome is incredibly significant in terms of understanding both the reasons for bat mortality and basic immune response. This discovery could also prove significant for studies on treatment for AIDS.


=== Federal ""Big Data"" initiative ===
McNutt spoke on a panel of leaders of US agencies (OSTP, NSF, NIH, DOE, DOD, DARPA and USGS) who rolled out the Obama administration's ""Big Data Research and Development Initiative."" Tom Kalil of the Office of Science and Technology Policy said, ""By improving our ability to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital data, the initiative promises to help accelerate the pace of discovery in science and engineering, strengthen our national security, and transform teaching and learning."" USGS announced the latest awardees for grants it issues through its John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis.


=== Energy: fossil fuels, fracking and biofuel ===
Reuters reported that USGS released into the public domain a new estimate of the world's oil and gas resources, the first such report since 2000. Excluding the U.S. the USGS found: ""565 billion barrels of conventional oil and 5,606 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered conventional natural gas in 171 priority geologic provinces of the world"". The report said about 75% of the resources are in four places: South America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and the North American Arctic. ""In particular, this assessment underscores the importance of continuing to strengthen our energy partnerships in the Western Hemisphere with nations like Brazil..."" said secretary Salazar.Bloomberg News reported that during her testimony in March 2012, McNutt told the United States House Committee on Natural Resources that ""less than 1 percent of wells drilled to dispose of the water after fracking causes 'induced seismicity'. McNutt said more information would reduce the risk of induced earthquakes in a year or two. She said:
It's a very solvable problem. You either have to put the holes in a different place, or pump it at a different rate.
United Press International reported in March 2012 that USGS has developed a tool that can map grasslands using remote sensing data from satellites. The technique will help if and when global demand for biofuel products increases as an alternative to fossil fuels. McNutt said in a statement that the study:

takes some of the guesswork out of deciding whether it could be feasible to raise a potentially high value crop for biofuels on America's grasslands.


=== Earthquakes: hazard reduction, drill, research ===
In cooperation with the Department of Veterans Affairs, USGS continued to monitor and record in detail the performance of veterans hospital buildings during earthquakes. Recently, two buildings were fitted with sensors at the Memphis VA Medical Center which is within the range of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, the most active earthquake zone in the Eastern United States. USGS works with the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) both to monitor buildings during earthquake events and to help design safer hospitals in the future.
On October 18, 2012, McNutt, Bill Leith of USGS and Michael Mahoney of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) continued earthquake practice at the ShakeOut at the Langston Hughes Middle School in Reston, Virginia. Participants learn to ""drop, cover, and hold on"" to protect themselves during an earthquake. Millions of people have participated since the event started in 2008. ""Going through drills makes it second nature for the students in the event of an actual emergency,"" McNutt said of The Great American Shake-Out event held in February 2013 in eight US states that border on the New Madrid Seismic Zone.USGS promised up to US$7 million in grants for earthquake research in 2013. The agency has funded about 90 such grants which, for example, cataloged southern California earthquakes to better prepare emergency responders, the public and the media. Projects also provided seismic hazard estimates for safer buildings and roads, and provided data on ground shaking to help minimize damage.


=== Landsat ===
NASA and USGS launched Landsat 8 on February 11, 2013, to continue their 40-year record of providing images for land use and climate change (about 9 million images as of 2013). McNutt wrote that Landsat 8 enhances USGS's position as land steward for the United States.


=== Departure ===
McNutt directed USGS from 2009 until 2013, when she announced her departure to USGS staff members. She said at the time that she would leave after the launch of Landsat 8 and that Suzette Kimball would serve as the acting director.


=== Exit summary ===
McNutt's announcement included a 21-point summary of her tenure which she prepared for Secretary Salazar. Among achievements listed were realignment of USGS management, eight ""DOI Climate Science Centers"", the ""first national water census on water use and availability"", a California prototype of Earthquake Early Warning, publication of the ""first two of the biological carbon sequestration reports"", and various means of ""advancing US energy independence"".


== Science tenure ==


=== Open access: Science Advances ===
As editor in chief, McNutt led the editorial team at Science in their decision to enter the world of open access publishing. Beginning in 2015, they expect to publish several thousand articles per year in the online only, open access journal Science Advances (compared to Science which can publish less than one thousand per year, accepting less than 6% of submissions). McNutt told Library Journal that they were searching for a solution to licensing, perhaps one license acceptable to all authors or perhaps offering a menu of licenses so each community can choose.


=== Keystone XL ===
McNutt initially sided with environmentalists who opposed approval of the Keystone Pipeline. In an interview for NPR's Morning Edition in 2014, she explained why she changed her mind and published an editorial in favor. First, the oil is already being transported for example by truck and train, using more fossil fuels than the pipeline would use. Second, she thinks concessions can be made in exchange for approving the pipeline, for example requiring a limit on carbon emissions when converting the tar sands to liquid for transport in the pipeline, and demanding that the pipeline be the safest ever built. Finally, because the pipeline is the very least expensive mode of transport, she found a potential revenue stream in the money saved by the pipeline which she thinks should be used to fund renewable energy in the U.S.


=== Climate engineering ===
Several U.S. agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency requested that the U.S. government study climate engineering and so the committee that McNutt chairs was born of the National Academy of Sciences. Ken Caldeira, who also sits on the committee, and David Keith are eager to try out ideas, in part spurred by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory funded by Bill Gates who is an enthusiast of climate engineering research. McNutt cautioned that government-sponsored field tests ""may not happen"".
Whether we wind up using these technologies, or someone else does and we suddenly find ourselves in a geo-engineered world, we have to better understand the impacts and the consequences.""


=== Meeting with Li Keqiang in China ===
Premier of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang requested a meeting with McNutt, as editor in chief of Science, to discuss science as part of her trip to China in January 2014. The meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes and the rules specified no US reporters present and the topics of ""science and the economy, not politics"". They talked on 13 January at Ziguangge, Zhongnanhai in Beijing. Li answered questions from McNutt about space exploration, China's scientific cooperation with other developing countries, climate change, education, and environmental protection. Science published a transcript of the 70 minute meeting.


=== Statistical review ===
With a goal to improve the reproducibility of its published research, McNutt announced in 2014 that Science had added statistical checks to its peer-review process. Based on collaboration with the American Statistical Association, the journal appointed seven experts to a Statistics Board of Reviewing who are responsible for securing outside statisticians to review potential Science articles.


=== Cover photo and controversies ===
The cover of the 11 July 2014 issue depicted three transgender sex workers from Indonesia with their heads cropped out. Citing ""she tricked me"" and the ""trans panic defense"" sometimes used by perpetrators, The Washington Post noted that transgender people are 30 percent more likely than others to be the victims of violence. Numerous people objected in their blogs. Congresswoman Jackie Speier objected in a letter to the publisher. Science CEO and publisher Alan Leshner apologized to Speier and termed the cover ""regrettable."" McNutt apologized on Twitter and in Science for ""any discomfort that this cover may have caused anyone"" and gave her:
[P]romise that we will strive to do much better in the future to be sensitive to all groups and not assume that context and intent will speak for themselves.
The cover (and unfortunate response from the former editor of ScienceCareers) and two other columns provoked Aradhna Tripati, Jennifer Glass, Lenny Teytelman, and 600 other scientists to send a letter in 2015 to Science accusing the journal of perpetuating sexist stereotypes. In one column, Alice S. Huang, the former president of Science's publisher, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, advised a female postdoctoral fellow not to complain about her supervisor, whose habit was trying to look down the woman's shirt, as long as the supervisor didn't develop other advances. In another, the chief biochemist at Toronto's University Health Network said he was promoted because his wife had given up her career and PhD to support him. McNutt published a formal apology in July 2015, and said that she thought Science should start an advisory board made up of young scientists who might be in tune with the issues.


=== Support for science ===
In June 2014, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) together with Nature Publishing Group and Science held a workshop on the reproducibility and rigor of research findings. More than 30 participants, who all publish preclinical biological research, codified a set of principles that will advance and support research that is reproducible, robust, and transparent. The principles are endorsed by 78 associations, journals and societies who all agreed to them.In January 2015, the Pew Research Center published a poll representing the public and a sample of scientists connected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The public and scientists disagreed quite dramatically on 12 out of 13 issues covered in the survey. On the occasion of Pew's publication, writer Joel Achenbach asked McNutt for her input on a National Geographic feature article, ""Why Do Many Reasonable People Doubt Science?"". McNutt neatly gave this definition:

Science is not a body of facts. Science is a method for deciding whether what we choose to believe has a basis in the laws of nature or not.


=== Retraction ===
In May 2015, McNutt and Science retracted a December 2014 study, ""When contact changes minds: An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality."" Donald Green requested the retraction after asking for and not receiving the study data from his coauthor Michael LaCour.


=== Family of journals expands ===
In 2015, Science announced the expansion of its family of journals to include Science Robotics and Science Immunology. Both were expected to begin publication in mid-2016. The first issue of Science Immunology was published in July 2016, while the first issue of Science Robotics was published in December 2016.


== National Academy of Sciences ==
In July 2015, McNutt was nominated to stand for election as president of the National Academy of Sciences. She was elected to a six-year term beginning July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2022.


=== Climate intervention ===
McNutt chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation and Discussion of Impacts, whose sixteen scientists published their findings on climate geoengineering in February 2015. The committee decided to issue two complementary reports, one on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions, and one on albedo modification. They agreed to call the process ""intervention"", which implies an action intended to improve, rather than ""management"" or ""geoengineering"" which imply control that people don't have. Of the reports' six recommendations, the first is that right now we can and should work toward mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and on adapting to the impacts of climate change.This work was supported by the U.S. intelligence community, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Academy of Sciences. At the press briefing on the release of the reports, McNutt expressed preference for the first report over the second: mitigation and adaptation are the way forward (explaining that albedo modification carries unknown environmental and governance risks).


== Workshop with Pope Francis ==
In May 2014, McNutt and a group of international scholars and scientists participated in a workshop with Pope Francis organized by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. By invitation, McNutt presented a paper, ""The Risks of Rising Seas to Coastal Populations."" In a September editorial in Science, McNutt discussed ""future habitability and sustainability of this planet"" and advocated for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which the group wished to adopt. She was a signatory of the workshop report. In advance of the Laudato si' papal encyclical of May–June 2015, the leadership council of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, of which McNutt is a member, released eight criteria for climate change mitigation, which they hoped would be addressed by the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.


== Awards and honors ==
McNutt was elected a Foreign member of the Royal Society, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is a fellow for the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the International Association of Geodesy.

36,"Stephanie K. Meeks (born 1964) is a long-time official in the non-profit community from Loveland, Colorado. She is best known for serving as president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation from July 2010 to December 2018.


== Presidency of the National Trust for Historic Preservation ==
During her tenure, the National Trust established a new signature program called National Treasures, which identifies significant threatened places across the United States and takes direct action through preservation, advocacy, marketing, and fundraising to save them. The current portfolio of nearly 100 historic sites includes, among other sites of note, Elkhorn Ranch, Shockoe Bottom, the Houston Astrodome, and the downtown Philadelphia gym of boxer Joe Frazier.Under Meeks, the Trust also began an initiative called ReUrbanism to highlight the critical connection between older buildings and vibrant cities. As part of these efforts, the Trust has, through its Preservation Green Lab, spearheaded original research, data, and tools to promote the reuse and reinvestment of older and historic buildings as the default option in American cities.In September 2016, she co-wrote a book on these issues entitled The Past and Future City: How Historic Preservation is Reviving America's Communities, published by Island Press.Also during her tenure, the National Trust has worked to strategically reposition its portfolio of 27 historic sites to encourage creative stewardship, interpretation, and financial sustainability. As part of this work, the Trust has experimented with new models that combine commercial and non-profit uses to enhance visitor experiences and bring in additional sources of revenue.


== Other non-profit positions ==
Before joining the National Trust, Meeks spent 17 years with The Nature Conservancy, ultimately serving as their COO and acting president and CEO.

51,"Dalia Mogahed (born 1975), is an American researcher and consultant of Egyptian origin. She is the director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) in Washington, D.C.  She is also President and CEO of Mogahed Consulting, a Washington, D.C.-based executive coaching and consulting firm specializing in Muslim societies and the Middle East. Mogahed is former executive director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies, a non-partisan research center that provided data and analysis to reflect the views of Muslims all over the world. She was selected as an advisor by U.S. President Barack Obama on the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.


== Early life and education ==
Mogahed was born in Cairo, Egypt, and immigrated to the United States at the age of four. She received her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering with a minor in Arabic from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Upon graduation, Mogahed joined the marketing department of Procter & Gamble. She subsequently received her MBA from the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh.


== Career and influence ==
She is the director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), a Washington, D.C. and Dearborn, Michigan-based Muslim research organization. Prior to ISPU, Dalia Mogahed chaired the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies from 2006 to 2012, which conducted research and gathered statistics on Muslims throughout the world. She was selected as an advisor by U.S. President Barack Obama on the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
Mogahed was invited to testify before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about U.S. engagement with Muslim communities and was a significant contributor to the Homeland Security Advisory Council's Countering Violent Extremism Working Group. She worked with Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross on the U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project to produce policy recommendations—many of which were adopted by the Obama administration.She is a board member and a leader in the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on the Arab World. She is also a nonresident public policy analyst at Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut.Prior to joining Gallup, Mogahed was the founder and director of a cross-cultural consulting practice in the United States, which offered workshops, training programs, and one-to-one coaching on diversity and cultural understanding. Mogahed's clients included school districts, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies, community service organizations, and local and national media outlets.


== Recognition and publications ==
Arabian Business magazine recognized Mogahed in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 as one of the most influential Arab women and The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre included Mogahed in its 2009 and 2010 lists of the 500 most influential Muslims. Ashoka: Innovators for the Public named her the Arab World's Social Innovator of the Year in 2010, and the University of Wisconsin Alumni Association recognized her with its ""Forward Under 40"" award for outstanding contributions by a graduate of the university.
She and John Esposito co-authored the book Who Speaks For Islam?: What a Billion Muslims Really Think, based on six years of research and more than 50,000 interviews representing Muslims in more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries. Accounting for more than 90% of the world's Muslim community, this poll is the largest, most comprehensive study of its kind. Mogahed later appeared as a commentator in the PBS documentary Inside Islam: What a Billion Muslims Really Think (2010), which was based on the book.
Mogahed's analysis has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy magazine, the Harvard International Review, the Middle East Policy Journal, and other publications.In 2019, Mogahed was recognized in a list of ""200 people who best embody the spirit and work of Frederick Douglass, one of the most influential figures in history"" by the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives and the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University in collaboration with The Guardian.


== Controversy ==
In 2009, during a phone interview with a London-based TV show hosted by Ibtihal Bsis Ismail, a member of Hizb ut Tahrir, Mogahed responded to a question about the support for sharia among women in the Muslim world which she observed in her research by arguing that ""the reason so many women support Sharia is because they have a very different understanding of sharia than the common perception in Western media. The majority of women around the world associate gender justice, or justice for women, with sharia compliance. The portrayal of Sharia has been oversimplified in many cases."" Mogahed later stated that she would not have agreed to the interview had she known about the program's affiliation and that she believed Ismail had misled her team ""to score propaganda points for an ideological movement"".


== Views ==
Mogahed rejects as unjustified calls for Muslims to condemn Islamic terrorism, arguing that there have been ""many"" such condemnations and that the demand ""unfairly implies"" that Muslims would support atrocities committed by other Muslims on account of their faith. Mogahed compares this with public attitudes to terrorist attacks committed by white Christians, noting that in these cases, ""we don't suspect other people who share their faith and ethnicity of condoning them"".


=== Freedom of speech ===
In 2020, in the context of violent demonstrations held in some Muslim countries against France for refusing to ban cartoons depicting the prophet of Islam, Mogahed asserted that such caricatures were “the equivalent of the N-word” or “blackface”, and were likewise “racial slurs” targeting “a vulnerable [...] and demonized community”. She added that it was ""completely disingenuous"" of France to project the idea that ""it is all open and anyone can say anything they want” whereas, for example, Holocaust denial is criminalized and wearing a hijab (Muslim headscarf, which some Muslims may view as a form of “self-expression”) is banned in French schools. According to Mogahed, the defense of free speech by the French government, in particular the right to draw cartoons and poke fun at religious dogma, amounts to the imposition of a “state religion” that she calls ""French Republic nationalism"".

An Interview With Dalia Mogahed: “Corny as it may sound, I am proof of the American dream”
Dalia Mogahed at ISPU"
52,"Catherine Jane Mohr (née Anderson, b. 1968) is a medical researcher from New Zealand, residing in the United States, who specializes in developing telemanipulator robotics for making surgery less invasive, and therefore providing faster recovery for patients. She had also designed fuel cells for land vehicles and high-altitude airplanes and studied sustainable architecture. Mohr is on the faculty of Stanford Medical School and is currently President of the Intuitive Foundation, the corporate foundation of Intuitive Surgical.


== Family ==
Mohr was born Catherine Jane Anderson, in Dunedin, New Zealand. Her mother was a biostatistician and her father was a biochemist. When she was a preschooler her family moved to the United States so har father could pursue postdoctoral research. While her parents always intended to return to New Zealand, they never could find employment in the same place, so Mohr grew up in the US. She did keep her New Zealand citizenship, however.Mohr's relationship with her spouse, Paul Mohr, started when she broke her pelvis in the year 2000, during a horseback riding incident. Immobilized for six weeks, her friends took care of her and had gatherings at her home, which is how their relationship got off the ground. They have daughter, Natalie.


== Education ==
An avid tinker and bicycle racer, Mohr worked as a bicycle mechanic near Boston while in high school. When Mohr matriculated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she was planning to study chemistry. Then, during her Sophomore year, joined a friend in founding a solar car racing team. During her first year on the team, of which she remained a member through her Senior year, Mohr realized that tinkering was what she loved and switcher her major to mechanical engineering. While on the solar car racing team, Mohr not only helped race in the US, but also worked on a car for Switzerland’s Tour de Sol and in 1987 she raced in Australia’s first World Solar Challenge, from Darwin to Adelaide. Her design work on wheels for solar cars, done in collaboration with James D. Worden, was recognized by a second place in the MIT Admiral Luis de Florez award. Also on her team was Megan Smith, who later became the Chief Technology Officer of the United States under President Barack Obama.After completing her B.S. in mechanical engineering, Mohr continued with graduate school in the same field, also at MIT. Mohr graduated in 1992; her Masters' Thesis was entitled: ""The Design of a Compact Actuator System for a Robotic Wrist/Hand."" Although she was originally working towards a Ph.D., Mohr decided to leave school and work on electric cars.In 1999, Mohr began fulfilling premed requirements through UCLA's extension school, and then matriculated at Stanford University School of Medicine. She earned her Doctor of Medicine in 2006, but elected not to move on to a residence program.


== Career ==
From her bike mechanic days in high school, Mohr remained busy.At MIT she held a number of teaching assistantships and research positions: under Dr. David Gordon Wilson, Mohr helped with a light for a bicycle that was powered by a crank generator; she worked on orthotic knee braces under Dr. Will Durfee; and was a TA for undergraduate design courses. She also worked for the Howe Lab at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, as an Applications Engineer for Premise, Inc., and from 1989-1992 she undertook various consulting jobs for Anderson Consulting.
When Mohr left school to work on electric cars, she became Rod Millen's program manager in California. She quickly moved on to be a mechanical engineer at AeroVironment, in Monrovia, California, working under Dr. Paul MacCready on fuel cells and hybrid batteries for land vehicles as well as high-altitude aircraft. She founded a laboratory focusing on creating fuel cell systems for aircraft designed to stay aloft for months at a time.After about five years of this work, Mohr reconsidered how she wanted to move forward. She once told the New York Times that her interest in engineering is ""about improving the human condition, and also, not incidentally, making the science better for when we and our loved ones need it."" So, although she was doing research in partnerships with the major US car companies, the fact that in the mid-1990s there was no sign of hybrid or electric cars would be sold to consumers became an issue for her. As she contemplated her career path, she observed the testing of experimental medical devices during surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital. When the technology did not work, Mohr started contemplating the engineering challenges of designing technology without a deep knowledge of the working of the human body. Eventually, Mohr decided to attend medical school.Mohr once noted that during her five years of med school, taking an extra year for conducting research, the idea of applying robotics to surgery really started to take hold in the medical community. From investigating minimally invasive surgical tools to assisting on laparoscopic surgeries, as well as working as a teaching assistant, Mohr delved into interdisciplinary studies. With Dr. Myriam Curet, she co-developed a laparoscopic Roux-enY gastric bypass. It became part of the da Vinci Surgical System, developed by Intuitive Surgical, where she would later spend much of her career.
While in medical school, Mohr also founded medical device start-up Veresure to market the LapCap, a tool she invented that made laparoscopic surgery safer. During laparoscopic surgery, it is necessary to lift the abdominal wall away from the abdominal cavity, or else surgeons risk harming the intestines or a large blood vessel. At the time, the common way to lift the area was to use towel clips on either side of the navel. Mohr invented a bell-shaped device that creates a vacuum, thereby lifting the abdominal wall and creating an air pocket in the abdomen. She sold it to Aragon Surgical in 2006.Since 2006, Mohr has also been an associate professor at the Stanford Medical School and studying methods for using simulations in surgical medical training. Additionally, she has been on the medical faculty at Singularity University, located at Moffet Field, since 2009.By 2001, her spouse was already working for Intuitive Surgical, developer of the da Vinci surgical robot. Since she was interested in the potential for robotics lessening the force exerted on the body during surgery, she suggested some of her mentors at med school try the da Vinci. She began consulting for Intuitive, and eventually went to work for them full time.Over several years she was Director of Medical Research, and then Senior Director and Vice President of the same department. Initially she continued work on techniques for minimizing pressure on the body during surgery. Over time, she looked at applications for new surgical technologies, including focal therapy for destroying tumors and infrared vision markers. She then spent about three years as Intuitive Surgical's Vice President of Strategy, before creating their Intuitive Foundation in 2018.She also advises startups in the U.K., the U.S., and New Zealand.Mohr is a member of Sigma Xi and the Institute for the Advancement of Engineering.


=== Patents ===
Mohr is listed as the inventor on approximately forty patents for medical devices.


=== Awards and honors ===
USA Science and Engineering Festival One of the “Nifty Fifty” noted science mentors (2012)

== Hobbies and professional sidelines ==
Mohr was an avid motorcyclist even before she really became much of an automobile driver.Mohr scuba dives and enjoys traveling and cooking. During medical school she invented a chocolate coin stamping machine, although it never went anywhere. In 2011, Mohr began playing cello; she told the Mercury News a few years later that she did so because ""one should always be a beginner at something.""In addition to her main career path, she got very interested in green architecture and developed a certain level of expertise in the area.She has given TED Talks on robotic surgery, green architecture, and a diving accident involving a sea urchin that just predated her horseback riding accident in which she broke her pelvis.

55,"Ann S. Moore (born May 29, 1950) is a former chairman and chief executive officer of Time Inc. until the fall of 2010. She became the company's first female CEO when she was appointed to the position in July 2002.


== Biography ==
Moore was a 1971 graduate of Vanderbilt University, where she received a B.A. in political science, and in 1978 she received an MBA from Harvard Business School.She began her career at Time in 1978 as a financial analyst.  She became the publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids in 1989 and publisher of People Magazine in 1991.  She was named People's president in 1993.  In 2001 she became vice-president of Time, Inc.  She is a member of the board of directors of Avon Products, Inc. and she has been on the Fortune Magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in American Business ten times. She also was listed among the 100 Most Powerful Women by Forbes.


=== Early life ===
In 1971 Moore graduated with a degree in mathematics from Vanderbilt University in Nashville and then worked in bookselling in Boston. In 1978 she graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School, where as one of only a handful of female MBA graduates she received 13 job offers. Moore was an avid magazine reader, and her ambition was to work in magazine publishing; she consequently accepted the lowest-paid job she had been offered, that of financial analyst at Time.
In her early years at Time, Moore gained experience in circulation and marketing. An avid sports fan, her first executive role was as media manager of Sports Illustrated in 1979. Two years later she was appointed assistant circulation director of Fortune before moving on to become the circulation director of Money and then of Discover . Moore returned to Sports Illustrated as general manager in 1984, becoming the magazine's associate publisher four years later.
Moore's ability to take a Time title to new readers was first demonstrated in 1989 when she was appointed founding publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids . Drawing upon her existing client network, Moore paved the way for the new title by preselling advertising pages. She also established an unusually close working relationship between the magazine's editorial section and its marketing and circulation divisions. The founding editor
of Sports Illustrated for Kids John Papanek later praised Moore's business model in which the metaphorical ""church"" and ""state"" were integrated in a highly effective manner.


=== Expanded description ===
Moore joined Time following her MBA. Her leadership potential showed early on in her career and she flew up the corporate ladder through a succession of key positions. In 1991, Moore became publisher, and later president, of People. Here she oversaw the launches of Australian Who weekly, In Style, People en Español, and Real Simple, giving Time a competitive edge in the women's magazine arena for the first time. Later, as executive vice-president, she ran the business and development operations for consumer magazines includingTime and People, while managing the company's consumer marketing division. She was nominated CEO in 2002. A major mission then was to take Time into the digital age, a project which has enjoyed increasing success. In 2007, digital traffic growth hit 72 percent; in 2008, despite an economic downturn, revenue for People.com rose 51 percent; and Time, Inc.’s US website has grown to be among the 20 largest online media properties.


=== Marriage and children ===
Daughter of Monty Sommovigo and Bea (maiden name unknown); married Donovan Moore (private wealth manager for Bessemer Trust); children: one.


== Expansion of People ==
In 1991 Moore became the publisher of People , a title appealing primarily to women, and two years later became the magazine's president. Moore believed that the very successful publication could grow larger still if marketed more specifically to readers interested in women's fashion and popular journalism. In an interview with Advertising Age in 2001 Moore referred to Time's ""inability to understand you could make money marketing to women"" (June 4, 2001). Until the 1990s Time published mainly financial and sporting magazines and marketed its titles almost entirely to an educated male readership.
Moore added beauty and fashion sections to People and changed its format from black-and-white to color. She also increased the proportion of advertising pages and changed the magazine's issue day from Monday to Friday so as to coincide with weekend shopping trips. Although the new direction in which Moore was taking the magazine met with a cautious response from Time senior management, her innovations proved successful. From 1991 People surpassed Time's traditional leader, Time magazine, in advertising revenue; by 2001 the gap had become considerable, with People earning $723.7 million to Time 's $666 million. In 2002 People earned one-third of Time's total revenues.
As president of People Moore established a pattern of successful magazine launches that further showed her all-around strengths in both the marketing and editorial aspects of magazine publishing. Along with spin-offs such as the Australian version of People , entitled WHO , Moore created four highly successful magazines at biyearly intervals between 1994 and 2000: In Style, People en Español, Teen People, and Real Simple.
In Style , launched in 1994, was the first magazine of its kind to include fashion, celebrity lifestyles, and shelter (interior design, architecture, and gardening) content. In Style reflected Moore's belief, expressed in a Brandweek interview in 1999, that ""runway fashion didn't work and it was celebrities who were the trend spotters in America"" (March 8, 1999). The new title drew cautious responses from both Moore's higherups at Time and sponsors but, as with the revamped People , was immediately successful with readers. By 2000 In Style was Time's 15th-biggest-selling title, with a circulation of 1.4 million.
In 1998 Moore was appointed president of the People group; in March 2001 she acquired responsibility for Time's Parenting group. Three months later she was appointed vice president to Time while still overseeing both the People and Parenting groups. Moore was appointed to the role of CEO and chairwoman of Time in July 2002, soon after the merger between Time Warner and AOL.

62,"Alina Morse (born May 2005) is an American entrepreneur, the CEO of Zolli Candy, which she founded when she was ten years old. Her company sells the candy she developed: sugar free lollipops called Zollipops, hard candy called Zolli Drops, and taffy called Zaffi Taffy. The candy is sold online and in about 25,000 stores in the United States and internationally, totaling US$6 million in sales in 2018. She was the youngest person to be on the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine, and she was twice invited to the White House by First Lady Michelle Obama. In addition to being the CEO of a multi-million-dollar company, Morse goes to high school and dances competitively.


== Personal life ==
Morse lives with her parents and younger sister Lola in Wolverine Lake, Michigan. Her mother Suzanne formerly worked in sales, and her father Tom was a consultant for Deloitte; all now participate in the company, with Tom working as Alina's manager and handling meetings when she is busy, Suzanne as her coach, schedule organizer, and stylist, and Lola making videos for the company YouTube channel. Tom has called working for her one of the most fulfilling things that he has done in his life.Morse attends Walled Lake Central High School in Commerce Township, Michigan and dances competitively in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz dance. During the school year, she balances the company with school work and dance practice; during the summer, she spends more time with the business. The company takes 35 to 40 percent of her time. After graduating high school, Morse intends to go on to college to learn more about running her company.


== Company ==
Morse's company is formally named Liquid OTC LLC, doing business as LOL, but most know it as Zolli Candy, or by the name of its flagship product, Zollipops. It is headquartered in her home town, Wolverine Lake, Michigan, 30 miles northwest of Detroit, with seven full-time employees and several independent contractors. Alina and Lola Morse are the majority owners of the company, making it a woman owned business.Total 2018 Zolli Candy sales at retail reached US$6 million (with US$2.2 million in company revenue), while Morse was 13 years old. As of 2019 Zolli Candy was on shelves in 25,000 stores, including the United States and internationally in China, Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.


=== Company history ===
Morse has wanted to be a CEO since she was three years old. She started keeping ideas for business inventions in an idea binder from the age of four. These ideas included peanut butter and jelly that squirted from the same tube to make it easier for children to prepare their own sandwiches and a robot parent that would substitute for her father at work so he could stay home and play with her.The idea for Zollipops, the sugar-free lollipops that are the company's flagship product, originated in 2012. Morse, seven years old, was at a bank with her father, when she was offered a lollipop that her father stopped her from eating, saying that it would rot her teeth. Morse began thinking about making a lollipop that would not. She asked her father over 100 times for four to five months before he agreed to help.It took two years of online research and at least a hundred unsuccessful experiments in their home oven, stove, and microwave. Making the candy in molds at home did not work and only made messes. Morse collaborated with a food scientist and her dentist on the ingredients. When she settled on a formula, Morse invested her life savings, $3,750 from birthday and holiday gifts, and got her father to match it. Morse and her father traveled to different commercial manufacturing plants throughout Michigan to find one with the equipment they needed. They eventually proposed their product to Whole Foods Market. It was Zollipops' first retail placement, and it was a success.The company became profitable a year and a half after its 2014 launch. Seventy thousand Zollipops were sold the first year, and sales doubled each year from 2014 through 2018. In 2016, Zollipops were picked up by Kroger, America's largest supermarket chain. Online sales began soon after Whole Foods, via Amazon, making up approximately a quarter of total sales. By 2018, Zollipops were both Amazon's best selling sugar-free hard candy and best selling lollipops.


=== Products ===
The Zolli candies are made with natural sweeteners including xylitol and erythritol instead of sugar. Some studies, including some in the International Journal of Dentistry, have found these sweeteners reduce dental plaque and oral bacteria. Other ingredients include citric acid, stevia, beetroot juice, and turmeric for color. Morse is allergic to artificial dyes and colors, and she has a friend who is allergic to peanuts and another who is allergic to gluten, so insisted all those be left out.
The candies include Zollipops lollipops, Zolli Drops hard candy, and Zaffi Taffy taffy, in seven flavors: cherry, grape, orange, peppermint, pineapple, raspberry, and strawberry. They are sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, and non-GMO. The ""z"" sound of ""xylitol"" is the origin of the ""Z"" in the name Zollipops, which was created by Morse's younger sister Lola, who had trouble saying ""xylitol lollipop"".


=== Million Smiles Initiative ===
In February 2015, in support of the American Dental Association National Children's Dental Health Month campaign, Morse and her company launched a ""100,000 Smiles"" campaign to give away 100,000 Zollipops for free to dentists and schools and donate 10 percent of Zolli Candy profits to schools for oral health education. By 2016, this became the ""250,000 Smiles"" campaign to give away 250,000 Zollipops and 10% of Zollipops profits. In 2018, to celebrate Zollipops being sold through Walmart, Morse announced the program was being expanded to ""One Million Smiles"", promising to give away 1,000,000 lollipops. In 2019 this became ""Two Million Smiles"" when Zolli Candy expanded to 10,000 stores.


== Recognition ==
Morse has been the company spokesperson since presenting to Whole Foods Market for its launch in 2014. In 2015, aged nine, she appeared on the Steve Harvey television show, saying ""I hope every kid in America has a clean mouth, a healthy smile and a Zollipop in their hands"". Her appearances were a powerful marketing tool, and with time her answers became less scripted. She has since appeared on Good Morning America, in a 2017 edition of Ripley's Believe It or Not!, Fox Business, National Public Radio, and she was interviewed by CNN on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.In 2015 and 2016 Morse was invited to the White House Easter Egg Roll by First Lady Michelle Obama; Zollipops were the only candy served there.In September 2018, Morse became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine. She was listed in the 2019 Success Magazine ""30 under 30"", and the InStyle Magazine ""Badass 50 Women"" lists. Zolli Candy was recognized by the 2019 Michigan ""50 Companies to Watch"" small business program and was listed as #635 on the ""2019 Inc. 5000: The Most Successful Companies in America"" list.

== Early life and education ==
Morse completed her undergraduate studies in civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. She moved to Stanford University for her doctoral research, where she studied anaerobic biodegradation of biocomposites for the building industry.


== Scientific career ==
Morse joined Bryant & Bryant, LLC, where she researched alternative building materials.Morse became concerned about the build up of non-biodegradable plastic in the environment. These plastics can pollute natural resources and damage ecosystems. She recognized that waste methane could be converted into biodegradable plastics that achieve similar functionalities to paraffin-based plastics. In microbial rich environments, these biodegradable plastics break down, producing methane which can once again be converted into a biodegradable plastic (Polyhydroxyalkanoates). She launched the company Mango Materials in 2010, which was named as one of the Next 50 Companies to Disrupt the World by Biofuels Digest in 2022.Morse was awarded the 2018 US Clean Energy Education and Empowerment (C3E) Initiative Entrepreneurship Award.

New York Center for Children (founder, director)"
65,"Eva Sarah Moskowitz (born March 4, 1964)  is an American historian, politician, and education reform leader who is the founder and CEO of the Success Academy Charter Schools. A member of the Democratic Party, Moskowitz served on the New York City Council, representing the 4th district on the Upper East Side, from 1999 to 2005. Moskowitz interviewed to be Donald Trump's Secretary of Education, but decided not to pursue the position.Moskowitz has advocated for the promotion of charter schools as a key component of education reform in the United States. She claims that they are instrumental in closing the educational disparity between disadvantaged and elite students. As one of the most prominent leaders for education reform, Moskowitz has clashed with the City of New York and its former mayor Bill de Blasio.


== Early life and education ==
On March 4, 1964, Moskowitz was born in New York City to Martin, a mathematician, and Anita, an art historian who fled Europe during the Holocaust. She was raised near Columbia University on 118th Street and Morningside Drive in Morningside Heights, Manhattan.Moskowitz graduated from the public magnet Stuyvesant High School in 1982,: 34  received a Bachelor of Arts with honors in history from the University of Pennsylvania, and a Ph.D. in American history from Johns Hopkins University with her 1991 dissertation, Naming the Problem: How Popular Culture and Experts Paved the Way For ""Personal Politics"".


== Career ==
She taught women's history at the University of Virginia as a visiting professor of communications and mass culture, at Vanderbilt University as an assistant professor of history, at City University of New York (College of Staten Island) as an assistant professor of history, and chaired the faculty seminar in American studies at Columbia University in 1996–1999, as well as teaching civics at the Prep for Prep school, where she was also the director of public affairs.


=== New York City politics ===
Moskovitz served on New York City Council as the member for the Upper East Side of Manhattan from 1999 until 2006. Between 2002 and 2004, Moskowitz wrote six laws, including laws on health care and campaign finance reform.Moskowitz's tenure in City County was set against the backdrop of a call for a reform of the national education system, where she became known for scourging the public-education system in New York City.When Moskowitz first returned to New York after a year in Vanderbilt, she volunteered in Gifford Miller's City Council campaign and served as his field director. When he became speaker in 2002, Miller made Moskowitz the chair of the city's Council Education Committee, where she served until 2005.In the three years in the position of chair, Moskowitz held over oversight hearings focused on New York City's public school system. While Moskowitz had the support of Joel Klein, who was Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education from 2002 to 2010, she developed a reputation for being ""abrasive"" even with those who admired and supported her.During the hearings, Moskowitz found that New York City's public schools lacked teachers, supplies and facilities to support art and music, that many schools lacked appropriate facilities for physical education, schools were being overcharged for supplies because they were required to use a city-mandated online purchasing system, science education had not been updated for a modern context, there were too few qualified science teachers and insufficient science facilities. that social studies and civics instruction was below par, that only 10 percent of black and Hispanic students were eligible for Regents diplomas, and that parents were being asked to donate basic supplies for basic hygiene, such as toilet paper and paper towels, In 2005, approximately 30 students appeared at a hearing to testify about school conditions including complaints about filthy bathrooms and broken toilets.United Federation of Teachers (UFT) members were ""enraged"" by the 2003 City Council hearings on teachers' contracts, seniority rights, work rules and on other education issues. When she ran for the Democratic party nomination to be the Manhattan Borough President to succeed C. Virginia Fields, under a campaign emphasizing education and transportation issues, she lost—partly because of the strong UFT opposition, who campaigned for Scott Stringer.


== Success Academy Charter Schools ==

The first Success Academy Charter School opened in 2006, with Moskowitz serving as Principal. There were 165 students. The school was co-located in a building in Harlem with two other zoned district public schools. According to the podcastStartUp, Moskowitz had succeeded in closing the achievement disparity between disadvantaged students and more elite public-school students in New York in standardized tests as required by the New York State Education Department for students in grades three and eight. With these unprecedented test scores, Moskowitz earned the support of the media, wealthy donors, including Wall Street hedge fund executives, and those with political power, such New York's Governor, David Paterson, and Mayor Bloomberg, who said that the Harlem Success Academy was ""the poster child for this country."" President Barack Obama also recognised charter schools as being crucial in reforming the education system. In March 2010, The Economist said that Harlem was viewed as the home of the charter-school movement due to the success of Harlem Success Academy.The day after her electoral defeat on September 15, 2005, Moskowitz met with Petry and Greenblatt who convinced her to lead their proposed charter school network. They became the Success Academy network's key funders that contributed to its growth starting with Harlem Success Academy. In 2008, three more schools opened.By 2012, Success Academy Charter School Inc. had made over eight million dollars in savings and cash investments, and it had spent over one million dollars on outreach services. In the 2010 fiscal year, Success Charter Network has raised $4.8 million from private funding along public funds from three levels of government. By 2010, charter schools had become a ""favorite cause"" of many of the founders of New York hedge funds, such as Anchorage Capital Group, Greenlight Capital, and Pershing Square Capital Management with over $15 billion assets under management, who used their fortunes as members of Democrats for Education Reform, (DFER) to influence educational policy and push for education reform. These wealthy hedge fund executives provided a significant counterweight from the political sphere to the teachers in the educational sphere who opposed charter schools. Joe Williams, author of Cheating Our Kids: How Politics and Greed Ruin Education, was DFER's CEO.
In 2015, hedge fund manager John Paulson, a major Trump ally, donated $8.5 million to Success. By December 2017, Success Academy included 45 schools, with schools in every borough of New York except Staten Island, with 17,000 students. According to a 2017 article in New Yorker, it was Moskowitz' wish that she would be running 100 schools within a decade.


=== Controversy ===
In an October 2015, PBS NewsHour feature, PBS special correspondent for education, John Merrow, reported on the high-profile network of charter schools in New York City. A representative of a Success Academy charter school that shares the same building with a zoned public school in Brooklyn, New York, said that they did use out-of-school suspension for kindergartners and first graders. In 2014, in one school alone, 44 out-of-school suspensions were issued to 203 kindergartners and first graders. A mother and her son, who was a student at the school, described the negative impact of these suspensions and how this led her to transfer her son to another school. In response to the criticism, Moskowitz wrote a detailed letter which included the young boy's school records—and his offenses. Moskowitz sent the letter to PBS, to education reporters, posted it on the Success website, and included it in her 2017 book. In 2019, the US Department of Education found that these disclosures violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Success Academy again violated a former student's privacy rights when school officials disclosed the details of her educational records to a reporter. In 2020, the New York State Education Department found the school had violated the New York State student privacy law.In 2017, hedge fund manager and Success Academy network board chair Daniel Loeb compared Democratic State Senate leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a black woman, to a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Moskowitz retained Loeb as chairman after he deleted the post and apologized, stating that opponents of charter schools were using the incident as an opportunity to call out the entire charter system.
In Midtown Manhattan June 2018, students from Success Academy's new flagship high school, took to the streets to protest Moskovitz's policies, including the ""no excuses"" disciplinary policies. In January 2018, Moskowitz—who was concerned the high school's principal and teachers were not being strict enough-took a measure of installing her desk in the school hallway to more closely monitor students As the number of new rules and severity of the consequences, increased, the students organized their first protest in the high school itself. These students and their parents had been attending protests against the Mayor of New York, organized by Moskowitz, for years. Moskowitz removed some rules and decreased the punishments. Gimlet described the final year of the first Success Academy's graduation class, as one that was tumultuous and chaotic. At the end of the school year, Moskowitz faced the ire of some parents during a school meeting. Some of them were expressed feelings of guilt, worry and alarm at what was happening to their teenagers. One raised concerns about the mean culture of the school, and another about the harsh manner in which teachers would talk to the students and the impact that this would have on them. However, not all parents agreed.
By 2019, according to The Washington Post, the Success Academy network of 47 schools serving 17,000 students, is the ""highest-performing and most criticized educational institution in New York"", and perhaps in the United States.


=== Charter school advocacy ===
In December 2014, Moskowitz said that public education in the U.S. is lacking in rigor. She said that children must be challenged, as well as engaged, in order for them to want to be at school.In her May 15, 2015 acceptance speech of the Manhattan Institute's Alexander Hamilton Award, Moskowitz promoted ""school choice"" which was first proposed in 1955. Moskowitz praised the use of tax credits as a powerful tool that allows parents' to ""vote with their feet.""Moskowitz believes that many underestimate the aptitude of inner city, low-income students by claiming that they ""cannot achieve at the highest levels.""Another approach that Moskowitz uses in Success Academy schools, is the implementation of the broken windows theory, popularized in the 1990s as a policing method by Rudy Giuliani and Bill Bratton. The theory has been criticized for over-criminalizing communities of colour. In every Success school there is a special business operations manager (BOM) team of several full-time staff, who are responsible for non-instructional components, such as maintenance of the school and courtyard and ensuring that the school is bright, cheerful and inviting.Moskowitz said that there is a need for more charter schools with socio-economic and racial diversity considering that New York City schools are ""shockingly segregated"".In an interview with MarketWatch, Moskowitz said that education was mostly a matter for the state and local governments, but that she would continue to form new conceptions of public education considering its importance as a civil rights issue.By 2019, the charter school movement the statewide cap on new charters was near capacity.


==== Conflict with New York City ====
Moskowitz has been in a battle with Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio since they both served on the New York City Council. In 2018, the New York Daily News called it a ""long-running war between Moskowitz and New York's charter-skeptic mayor. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the number of charter schools in New York increased from 17 charter schools in 2002, to 183 in 2013.In a November 28, 2011 interview with the New York Daily News Editorial Board, Moskowitz emphasised the need for great schools and that this would only occur with a reform-minded administration. By November 2011, Moskowitz was concerned about Bloomberg's potential replacement in the 2013 mayoral election. At that time de Blasio was already dubbed as an obstructionist of the charter schools, by the Daily News. Bloomberg had proven to be a strong effective advocate for charter schools in the City. By 2011, Moskowitz already had opened nine successful charter schools and had five more schools that she was preparing for opening. She told the Daily News that she was considering running for the office of mayor.Moskowitz's opposition to de Blasio intensified as she advocated for an end to caps on charter schools in general, and for Success Academy in particular. During his mayoral campaign de Blasio, in June 2013, said that he would end the policy of providing free rent for charter schools that shared buildings with district zoned public schools run by the Department of Education. Charter schools, such as Success Academy are co-housed with public schools and have access to utilities, janitorial services, and school-safety officials for free. De Blasio, said that he would end free rent for some co-located charter schools. Charter schools are funded by the public but are autonomously owned and operated. Charter schools can ""add revenue from private sources, lengthen their academic day and year,"" and are in control of their own curriculum. De Blasio, who had served on City of New York's Council Education Committee with Moskowitz for four years, singled out Success Academy in his comments.De Blasio is a strong supporter of teachers unions, whereas charter schools are under no obligation to hire or retain non-unionized teachers. By 2014, only about 12 percent of the charter schools were unionized.De Blasio's stance against charter schools was just one aspect of what was described as a rebellion against corporate-friendly education policies in New York.As New York Mayor, de Blasio announced in March 2014, that he was disapproving three of Success Academy's co-locations that had been approved under his predecessor, Bloomberg, due to concerns of placing young children in high schools or displacing special needs public school students. Some in the media called this de Blasio's war on charter schools and minority students. Moskowitz, who was called a fierce critic de Blasio's, closed all of 22 Success Academy schools on March 4, 2013, and encouraged the staff, students to participate in what would be one of the largest civic field trips, with thousands of students, parents and teachers rallying in Albany. Moskowitz was criticized for seeking the support of hedge fund managers and other influential financial leaders on Wall Street in her fight against de Blasio. Moskowitz, along with the allied charter school PAC StudentsFirst, contributed over $4 million to New York State Senate Republican campaigns, helping them maintain control of the chamber, to foster legislation for further privatization.Moskowitz founded and directs the Great Public Schools Political Action Committee (PAC) that supports charter schools, following an election in which a pro-Success Academy candidate lost.: 382–3  In the 2011–2012, the Great Public Schools (PAC) gave $50,000 to Andrew Cuomo 2014, Inc.


== Selected publications and films ==
In 1993, Moskowitz wrote, produced and directed the VHS-only Some Spirit in Me, which examined the feminist movement from non-prominent activists. In 1996 she published a Journal of Women's History article on the work of Betty Friedan. In 2001, Moskowitz released the book In Therapy We Trust. The book argued that the American emphasis on self-fulfillment damages civic engagement. In 2012, she co-authored Mission Possible: How the Secrets of the Success Academies Can Work in Any School with Arin Lavinia. In 2017, HarperCollins published her memoir, The Education of Eva Moskowitz.In 2010, Moskowitz was featured in the documentaries The Lottery and Waiting for ""Superman"", which followed students applying to Success Academy as well as protests and legal disputes associated with charter schools.


== Personal life ==
She married Eric Grannis. They have three children,: 156–7  two of whom attend Success Academy Harlem East.

== Biography ==
Maureen Mulvaney is one of three children born, in 1950, to Marie and Paul Mulvaney, a US Naval Officer.  The Mulvaneys named their oldest daughter, Maureen G. Mulvaney, as it was both lyrical and Irish but mostly so the initials would be MGM—their Big Production.Marie Mulvaney was the ‘Queen of Spaced Repetition’.  Maxwell Maltz's  was noted for coining the term ‘Spaced Repetition’.  By repeating the same phrases, either positive or negative, six times a day, for 21 days, one would create a positive or negative habit. Marie, unknowingly, used Maltz's techniques to reinforce positive statements with Maureen by repeatedly telling her, “You are funny. You are MGM--a big production.  One day, you'll be on stage speaking before thousands of people.”Marie's practices of repeating statements to her daughter succeeded. Maureen, unconsciously, started taking interest in speaking. First, she became a special educator/ elementary teacher.  Then she progressed to teaching college psychology. Finally, she used the speaking skills she had learned through teaching and combined them with the skills she had learned from her beloved sorority experiences  to live up to Marie's expectation by becoming an internationally known speaker.  Organically, people stopped calling her Maureen and began to call her—MGM, a big production.

Mulvaney earned a B.S. dual major in Special Education and Elementary Education from Troy State University, in Troy, Alabama.  She earned an Ed.M. from Boston University, overseas program, in counseling psychology. Mulvaney is a sister of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, the first secret society for college women in the world.

72,"Yasmine Mustafa (Arabic: ياسمين مصطفى; born 1982) is an American CEO, entrepreneur and activist.


== Early life ==
Mustafa was born in Kuwait, located in the northwestern corner of the Persian Gulf, and lived there until she was eight years old. She was eight years old when the Gulf War began and was forced to evacuate with her family and move to America. After arriving in America, her younger brother was born.  The family settled in Philadelphia, where Mustafa learned English and spent the rest of her childhood. 
Her first job was working in a 7-Eleven store owned by her father.
She got into tech when she was 24 and interned at a tech consultancy firm while in the entrepreneurship program at Temple University in Philadelphia. She worked her way up at the firm and was offered a job by the company owner, Skip Shuda, after she graduated from college. While working at this tech company, she got the idea for her first company—123LinkIt.


== Professional life ==
Mustafa attended Temple University part-time, financing her own education and graduating summa cum laude in 2006. In 2009, she started 123LinkIt, a company created to help writers make money off of their blogs.

Mustafa came up with the idea of ROAR for Good when she was 30 years old and traveling in Spanish countries for six months. While traveling, she was told horror stories about women who had been sexually assaulted or harassed, and when she returned from her trip, she found out her neighbor had been severely beaten and raped. These stories made her realize the prevalence of violence against women, and she wanted to do something about it.
After doing research and surveys, she and her team realized something needed to be made that could help someone getting attacked, but not be used against them. They came up with the idea for “Athena,” which looks nice enough for women to wear, deters attackers with an audible alert message, and notifies pre-selected contacts of the wearer's location when pressed.Girl Develop It
The Philadelphia chapter of Girl Develop It (GDI) was also founded by Mustafa. She learned about GDI from Twitter and signed up and completed one of their courses. After finishing her course, she approached her course instructor (GDI’s founder) and talked to her about expanding. GDI was then brought to Philadelphia six months later thanks to Mustafa.
