0,"Lilia Ann Abron (born March 8, 1945) is an entrepreneur and chemical engineer. In 1972, Abron became the first African American woman to earn a PhD in chemical engineering.


== Early life ==
Abron was born in Memphis, Tennessee, was the second of four daughters. She was born prematurely, at home, and had to be rushed to the hospital by her aunt in a cab, as ambulances were not available for African Americans at the time.Her parents were both educators who had attended LeMoyne College (now LeMoyne-Owen College). Her father, Ernest Buford Abron, had sustained an injury playing football in college, and was thus unable to serve during World War II. He worked as a Pullman porter and later was a teacher. Abron's mother, Bernice Wise Abron, was a typist from Arkansas. She typed briefs for Wiley Branton, the Little Rock Nine's defense attorney.Abron's parents were Baptists and she was baptized at the age of nine. She participated in Girl Scouts and in the junior choir at her church.Abron attended a public school and was placed in the school's math and science track. After graduating from Memphis High School, she decided to study medicine.


== Education ==
Abron studied at LeMoyne-Owen College. She was granted a scholarship, which she lost after her freshman year because her grades were not high enough. She switched from a biology major to a chemistry major. In 1966, Abron earned a B.S. in chemistry from LeMoyne-Owen College, with distinction.Abron's advisor at LeMoyne-Owen, Dr. Bueler, suggested that she study engineering. She also credits Dr. Juanita Williamson, an English Professor at LeMoyne-Owen and a fellow African American, with inspiring her to pursue further education. She was offered a full-tuition scholarship from Washington University in St. Louis to study sanitary engineering, funded by the Public Health Service. Washington University was very different to anything she had experienced up to that point: it was her first time away from home, one of only two women in a large class of predominantly white males. She completed her entire degree in just thirteen months, graduating in 1968 with an MS in Environmental Engineering. During her time at Washington University, Abron developed the goal of working in academia and gained experience by working in her professors' labs.After graduating, Abron found it difficult to find work as an environmental engineer. She worked for a year as an environmental chemist in the Kansas City water department, then for another year as a research environmental chemist at the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago.She began her PhD in September 1968 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's department of civil engineering, under the supervision of Dr. Rolfe Skrimbee. When he moved to the University of Iowa, she moved with him. However, Dr. Skrimbree left the University of Iowa before Abron finished her research, so she completed her degree in chemical engineering in 1972, under the supervision of James O. Osburn. She was the first African American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, and only the third woman to receive a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Iowa. Her thesis focused on reverse osmosis, and was titled: ""Transport Mechanism in Hollow Nylon Fiber Reverse Osmosis Membranes for the Removal of DDT and Aldrin from Water"".


== Career ==
Abron was assistant professor of civil engineering at Tennessee State University from 1971. She was also an assistant professor of environmental engineering Vanderbilt University from 1973. In 1975, she moved Howard University as assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, simultaneously working at Washington Technical Institute (now part of the University of the District of Columbia).Dr. Abron is a registered professional engineer, and a member of the Water Environmental Federation, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Water Works Association, the Society of Sigma Xi, and the American Association of University Women. She also serves on the Engineering Advisory Board for the National Sciences Foundation.In 2004, she was elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2020, for ""leadership in providing technology-driven sustainable housing and environmental engineering solutions in the United States and South Africa"". She was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, DC Alpha Chapter as an Eminent Engineer, and she is a History Maker®.
She has been bestowed the highest honor – Distinguished Member, Class of 2021 – of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). As of January 2021, she became President of The American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (AAEES).  


=== PEER Consultants, P.C. ===

AP Obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer
Annenberg Foundation Biography of Leonore Annenberg"
12,"Anousheh Ansari (Persian: انوشه انصاری; née Raissyan; born September 12, 1966) is an Iranian American engineer and co-founder and chairwoman of Prodea Systems. Her previous business accomplishments include serving as co-founder and CEO of Telecom Technologies, Inc. (TTI). The Ansari family is also the title sponsor of the Ansari X Prize. On September 18, 2006, a few days after her 40th birthday, she became the first Iranian in space. Ansari was the fourth overall self-funded space tourist, and the first self-funded woman to fly to the International Space Station. Her memoir, My Dream of Stars, co-written with Homer Hickam, was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2010.She is the CEO of the X Prize Foundation.


== Early life ==
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward. When Ansari was six years old her parents divorced. Ansari has a sister, Atousa Raissyan, who is five years younger.  At the age of six, Ansari would visit her grandparents sleeping overnight on the balcony as there was no air conditioning, Ansari would gaze at the night sky and was very curious about space. In Tehran at the age of seven, Ansari attended a French Catholic school called Jeanne d’Arc, half the day was taught in Farsi and half in French. She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and recalls memories of 'hearing gun shots, screaming, people being killed, and explosions', her life, where she had never known violence of any kind, quickly turned upside down. From revolution to the Iran-Iraq war, Ansari would have to take shelter in the basement of her apartment building, where she was the eldest of the children taking shelter, she would narrate stories to them, offering them comfort, which distracted them from the noise of bombs being dropped outside.  Ansari immigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager, and attended a high school in Northern Virginia, Lake Braddock. Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.


== Career ==
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as deregulation happened in the US telecommunications industry. The company was a supplier of Softswitch technology that enabled telecom ""service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities."" The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered products that allowed the integration between existing telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology. Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became ""a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division.""
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems and was the current chairwoman and CEO. Prodea is a technology and services management company. Prodea is a privately held company formed by the Ansari family with development centers in Richardson, Texas, and Silicon Valley.


== Space ==
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a ""space tourist"" and prefers the title of ""spaceflight participant.""Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation's Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees. Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE has officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE to honor their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the ""privatization of space,"" a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and people into space for exploration and other purposes.The Ansari family also invested in a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.


=== Spaceflight ===
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd. On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.
Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, ""I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—not to give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."" The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky. The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of the Iranians. Ansari in return thanked them.Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday, September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid more than $20 million USD. The spacecraft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC). Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov. She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a kiss from her husband, Hamid. The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.During her nine-day stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments, including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.


=== Iranian flag controversy ===
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e., the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life. A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she intended to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch. She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions between the United States and Iran, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had ""plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space.""


=== Reactions to Ansari's flight ===


==== Crewmates ====
Michael López-Alegría, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: ""I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think a space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal.""López-Alegría later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program, which is important to the U.S. space program: ""If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well,"" he said. Ansari's presence in space ""is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world.""The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as ""very professional"" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade. López would eventually change his stance on tourism at the ISS and joined Axiom space, eventually commanding their first tourist mission.

16,"Alma Asay was the CEO and co-founder, along with Dana Peterson, of Allegory Law, a legal technology company that provided a software platform for litigation management. Asay founded the company after departing a career at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, where she learned from and worked with top litigation attorney Orin Snyder working on complex litigation.  Allegory Law, during its infancy, like many startups, has had bumpy moments.  Disagreements with Peterson lead to the founding team breakup, and Asay had to sell her home to fund the startup, leading to her having to stay on couches of friends and family to extend her financial runway. In addition, in the early stages of the startup, the members of Asay's engineering team were paid in equity; and when they decided the product was ready to launch, Asay disagreed, thinking more work was needed.  This forced the company to a standstill, and it took a year to raise the money needed to buy out her partners so she could restart her work. Since then, Asay closed a convertible debt round in early 2014, raised $715,000 from individuals in late 2016, and raised $500,000 from legal tech executives and investors in early 2017.Allegory Law was acquired by New York-based Integreon in November 2017, Asay joined Integreon as Chief Innovation Officer. On March 30, 2022, Asay joined a legal technology company, Litera, where she joined LiteraTV lineup ahead of its launch.  A few months thereafter, on August 21, 2020, Litera acquired Allegory Law from Integreon, reuniting the founder to her original legaltech startup.  However, Asay has mentioned in interviews that Litera did not consult her during its strategic planning sessions to acquire Allegory Law and she did not take any leadership role with respect to Allegory Law after its acquisition, which had been rebranded as Litera Litigate.  As of June 28, 2021, Asay joined the law firm Crowell & Moring as the senior director of practice innovation and client value.Asay is regularly invited to speak on the topics of legal technology and innovation. She is also vocal on the topic of women entrepreneurs in technology. In 2016, she was named one of the ABA Legal Technology Research Center's Women of Legal Tech, as well as a winner of the FastCase 50.Asay received her B.A. in Psychology from the Pennsylvania State University, then received her J.D. from the NYU School of Law.

26,"Meredith Attwell Baker is the president and chief executive officer of CTIA, an industry trade group that represents the international wireless telecommunications industry. From 2009 to 2011, Baker was a member of the United States Federal Communications Commission, nominated by U.S. President Barack H. Obama. She also served in the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as a political appointee, and was subsequently named a deputy assistant secretary of the Commerce Department by President George W. Bush in February 2007.


== Early life and education ==
Baker is a native of Houston, Texas. Her father, Kirby Attwell, was president of Lincoln Liberty Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Lincoln Consolidated, at which he worked with the late former Texas Democratic U. S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Her great-great grandfather was Isaac Van Zandt, a political leader in the Republic of Texas. The Attwells have had long-standing friendships with the Baker and Bush political families. She is a daughter-in-law of James A. Baker, III.In high school, Baker attended the Sidwell Friends School for one semester. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in journalism and Spanish in 1990 from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. She procured a law degree from the University of Houston in 1994. Baker is a member of the State Bar of Texas.


== Career ==
Early in her career, Baker worked at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Houston, and later at the law firm DeLange and Hudspeth, where she focused on bankruptcy and corporate law. She worked at the U.S. Department of State in the agency's Legislative Affairs Office from 1990 to 1992.From 1998 to 2000, Baker served as director of congressional affairs for CTIA, at which she helped designate 9-1-1 as the national emergency number and fought against cell phone ""cloning"". She then served as senior counsel at Covad Communications from 2000 to 2002, taking time off to assist George W. Bush's campaign with the 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida. She later served as vice president at Williams Mullen from 2002 to 2004, where she focused on intellectual property, international trade, and telecommunications.


=== United States Department of Commerce ===
In January 2004, Baker joined the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, as a senior advisor. She was subsequently named a deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Commerce by President George W. Bush in February 2007, and then assistant secretary and acting head of NTIA after John Kneuer left the agency in November 2008. She also served as the Office of International Affairs' acting associate administrator and was detailed to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.During her tenure at NTIA, Baker ""advised and represented the Executive Branch on both domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities"". According to her FCC biography, Baker's mission at NTIA was to ""promote market-based policies that encourage innovation and benefit consumers"" as she encouraged efficient radio spectrum use by the federal government and headed the management of the Internet's domain name and numbering system. Baker argued the ""government would do best to tread lightly"" in broadcast regulations given the ""robust and diverse media marketplace"". In 2008, Baker voiced concern over the FCC's ruling that Comcast violated policy by ""blocking and degrading"" file-sharing applications. She also oversaw the $1.5 billion coupon program to help consumers with the nation's digital television transition.


=== Federal Communications Commission ===
Baker was nominated by President Obama as a member of the FCC on June 25, 2009. She was sworn in on July 31, 2009, and held the role until June 3, 2011. Like all of President Obama's political appointees, she signed an ethics pledge preventing her from lobbying anyone working at the FCC for two years after she left the independent agency, or any FCC appointees for the rest of Obama's presidency. Baker was one of two Republicans on the five-person commission.During her tenure, Baker supported efforts to increase radio spectrum availability for wireless broadband services. She also advocated for smart antenna technology and a spectrum database to maximize radio wave use. Baker reportedly voted ""with some reservations"" to start creating new net neutrality guidelines only after voicing her concerns to Julius Genachowski.  She disagreed with his inclusion of wireless service providers within net neutrality policies.


=== NBC Universal ===
In May 2011, Baker accepted a job as senior vice president of governmental affairs for NBC Universal. The move, which came four months after the FCC approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal, received some criticism from groups who opposed the merger and voiced concerns about the revolving door between legislative and regulatory agencies and private sector companies. The company said that it did not approach Baker about the position until mid April, after NBC Universal lobbyist Bob Okum resigned. Similarly, Baker said she had no contact with NBC Universal or Comcast about the position when the acquisition was pending. Both Baker and Comcast said the FCC's general counsel, Austin Schlick, was made aware of the potential transition on April 18, and Baker recused herself from merger discussions. Comcast also noted that Kyle E. McSlarrow, who hired Baker at NBC Universal, was not employed by the company when the merger was completed; he was serving at the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) at the time.While Baker could immediately lobby Congress and supervise employees who directly lobby the FCC, to comply with Obama's ethics pledge, she could not personally lobby any executive branch political appointee (including the FCC) during Obama's presidency. However, after two years, she could lobby non-political appointees at the FCC. Additionally, she may never personally lobby anyone on the Comcast/NBC merger agreement.


=== CTIA ===
Baker became CTIA's president and CEO in mid 2014, having previously served as the advocacy group's director of congressional affairs from 1998 to 2000.  In a statement released after her hiring, Baker identified three spectrum priorities for the association: ""place more emphasis on technical and engineering expertise related to spectrum and wireless technologies; work with commercial and government users to produce a viable five-year plan for the future of spectrum usage; and begin to regularly assess how efficiently spectrum is being used.""In January 2015, Baker testified on the importance of an open Internet but against the reclassification of mobile broadband as a Title II service under the Communications Act of 1934 at a hearing held by the House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. Two months later, CTIA, NCTA, and USTelecom, filed legal challenges against the FCC's net neutrality order reclassifying broadband under Title II.Baker has testified before Congress on the issue of spectrum.  In a March 2016 media call, she said the industry is ready to invest billions of dollars to fund spectrum and new infrastructure, suggesting the ""spectrum pipeline should become a national priority"" because ""100 MHz of spectrum is equal to $30 billion to the economy and 1 million jobs.""  In 2016, CTIA released reports outlining the importance of U.S. leadership in 5G and high band spectrum. The organization praised the FCC's unanimous vote in July 2016 to allow wireless operations above 24 GHz.In 2017, CTIA released a report authored by Accenture on the economic benefits of 5G deployment, with Baker noting, ""Accenture's report confirms the significant benefits from the next generation of wireless, driven by hundreds of billions of dollars that the wireless industry will invest to deploy 5G.""

27,"Winifred Mitchell Baker (born 1957) is the Chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation and CEO of Mozilla Corporation, a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation that coordinates development of the open source Mozilla Internet applications, including the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Baker was trained as a lawyer. She coordinates business and policy issues and sits on both the Mozilla Foundation Board of Directors and the Mozilla Corporation Board of Directors. In 2005, Time included her in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.


== Education and early employment ==
Baker received a BA in Chinese studies at  the University of California, Berkeley in 1979, achieving a Certificate of Distinction. She received her JD from the Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California, Berkeley in 1987 and was admitted to the State Bar of California in the same year. From January 1990 until October 1993, she worked as a Corporate and Intellectual Property Associate at Fenwick & West LLP, a law practice that specialises in providing legal services to high technology companies. She then worked for Sun Microsystems as an Associate General Counsel from November 1993 until October 1994.


== Netscape Communications Corporation and mozilla.org ==
In November 1994, Baker was hired as one of the first employees of the legal department of Netscape Communications Corporation. Reporting directly to CEO Jim Barksdale, she jointly set up the initial department. She was responsible for intellectual property protection and legal issues relating to product development, reporting to the General Counsel. She also created and managed the Technology Group of the Legal Department. She was involved with the Mozilla project from the outset, writing both the Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License. In February 1999, Baker became the general manager of mozilla.org, the division of Netscape that coordinated the Mozilla open source project. In 2001, she was fired during a round of layoffs at America Online, by then the parent of Netscape. Despite this, she continued to serve as general manager of mozilla.org on a volunteer basis.


== Open Source Applications Foundation ==
In November 2002, Baker was employed by the Open Source Applications Foundation, helping to guide the group's community relations and taking a seat on OSAF's Board of Directors.


== Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation ==
Baker was instrumental in the creation of the Mozilla Foundation, an independent non-profit that was launched on July 15, 2003, as America Online shut down the Netscape browser division and drastically scaled back its involvement with the Mozilla project. Baker became the President of the Mozilla Foundation and was appointed to the five-person Board of Directors.When the Mozilla Corporation was launched as a taxable subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation on August 3, 2005, Baker was named the CEO of the new entity. In addition, she joined the Mozilla Corporation's Board of Directors, though she also kept her seat on the Mozilla Foundation's board, as well as her role as Chairperson.
On January 8, 2008, Mozilla announced that Baker, while retaining her role as Chairperson of the Mozilla Foundation, would no longer serve as CEO of the Corporation, and that MoCo's Chief Operating Officer John Lilly would take over this role. The reasons cited for this change was Mozilla's rapid growth, which made it difficult for executives to continue to take on many different roles. In April 2020 she was named CEO of Mozilla Corporation again.


== Negative salary-achievements correlation controversy ==
In 2018 she received a total of $2,458,350 in compensation from Mozilla, which represents a 400% payrise since 2008. On the same period, Firefox marketshare was down 85%. When asked about her salary she stated ""I learned that my pay was about an 80% discount to market. Meaning that competitive roles elsewhere were paying about 5 times as much. That's too big a discount to ask people and their families to commit to.""In 2020, after returning to the position of CEO, her salary had risen to over $3 million (in 2021, her salary rose again to over $5 million, and again to nearly $7 million in 2022). In August of the same year the Mozilla Corporation laid off approximately 250 employees due to shrinking revenues, after previously laying off roughly 70 in January (prior to the pandemic). Baker blamed this on the COVID-19 pandemic, despite revenue rising to record highs in 2019, and market share shrinking.

USAF biography"
32,"Sydney Biddle Barrows (born January 14, 1952) is an American businesswoman and socialite who became known as an escort agency owner under the name Sheila Devin; she later became known as ""The Mayflower Madam"". She has since become a management consultant and writer.In October 1984, her escort service was disbanded, and after pleading guilty and being fined $5,000 for promoting prostitution, she wrote a 1986 autobiography, Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows. A TV movie based on the book starring Candice Bergen was broadcast in 1987 under the title Mayflower Madam.


== Early life, education and career ==
Barrows comes from the Biddle family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is descended from Mayflower passengers William Brewster, John Howland, Elizabeth Tilley, and Thomas Rogers. Her father is Donald Byers Barrows, Jr. (born 1926) of Rumson, New Jersey, and her mother is Jeannette Ballantine, who is now married to Felix Molzer, a musician and director of the Monmouth Arts Center, N.J.Barrows attended Stoneleigh-Burnham, a girls' boarding school in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and is an alumna of the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York City. She worked in 1975 as an assistant to Alan Snyder, the bath buyer for Abraham & Straus. She was introduced to the world of high-class prostitution and started her own escort service named Cachet, which existed in New York City from 1979 to 1984. Some of its clients included industrialists, high-powered business executives, lawyers, foreign diplomats, and Arabian oil sheiks.In October 1984, Cachet was shut down, Barrows was arrested, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office charged her with promoting prostitution. When arrested at her home office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Barrows identified herself as Sheila Devin; one report describes her as the CEO.The name ""Mayflower Madam"" was coined by a New York Post reporter, Peter Fearon, who broke the story of Barrows's Mayflower connections. After her guilty plea, Barrows published a best-selling autobiography, Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows (1986). Barrows appeared in 1987 on the late-night television series Saturday Night Live with a parody of her book; the sketch included Candice Bergen, who portrayed Barrows in the made-for-TV movie Mayflower Madam (1987). Barrows subsequently wrote two books on sexual etiquette.In late 2008, Barrows finished Uncensored Sales Strategies: A Radical New Approach to Selling Your Customers What They Really Want—No Matter What Business You're In, co-authored with marketing expert Dan Kennedy. Since the mid-late 1990s, Barrows has run a consulting business with a focus on customer service and experience.

Sydney Barrows Interview"
33,"Carol Ann Bartz (born August 28, 1948) is an American business executive, former president and CEO of the internet services company Yahoo!, and former chairman, president, and CEO at architectural and engineering design software company Autodesk.


== Early life and education ==
Bartz was born in Winona, Minnesota, the daughter of Shirley Ann (née Giese) and Virgil Julius Bartz. Her mother died when Carol was eight years old. A few years later, she and her younger brother, Jim, moved from Minnesota across the Mississippi River to the home of their grandmother, Alice, on a dairy farm near Alma, Wisconsin. In high school, Bartz did well in mathematics, and was also homecoming queen. She began college at William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri, and subsequently transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison where she received a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1971. While in college, she supported herself as a cocktail waitress. Bartz also has two half brothers and two half sisters all living in Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Bartz was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degree (2002) from New Jersey Institute of Technology, an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from William Woods University.


== Career ==
In 1976, Bartz went to work at the manufacturing conglomerate 3M, but left after her request to transfer to the headquarters was denied. Bartz moved on to the computer industry, including jobs at Digital Equipment Corporation and Sun Microsystems.


=== CEO of Autodesk ===
She became CEO of Autodesk in 1992. According to Forbes, Bartz ""transformed Autodesk from an aimless maker of PC software into a leader of computer-aided design software, targeting architects and builders."" She is credited with instituting and promoting Autodesk's ""3F"" or ""fail fast-forward"" concept, also referred to as fail fast – the idea of moulding a company to risk failure in some missions, but to be resilient and move on quickly when failure occurs. She stepped down as CEO in 2006, and became the executive chairman of the board.During her 14-year tenure as the company's CEO, Autodesk net revenue substantially increased, and annual revenue rose from $300 million to $1.5 billion, with the stock price rising an average of 20 percent annually.Bartz served on several boards of directors, including those of Intel, Cisco Systems, Autodesk, BEA Systems, Network Appliance, and the Foundation for the National Medals of Science. Additionally, she has been a member of the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.


=== CEO of Yahoo! ===
On January 13, 2009, Bartz was named CEO of Yahoo!, the Internet services company which operated the fourth most-visited Web domain name in the world, succeeding co-founder Jerry Yang. During a conference call with financial analysts later in January 2009, she announced her intention to make sure Yahoo! got ""some friggin' breathing room"" so the company could ""kick some butt."" Rob Hof of Business Week was skeptical that Bartz or anyone else could save the company: ""... it's not yet clear if Bartz can turn Yahoo around no matter how good she may be.""In May 2009, Reuters reported that she had already ""worked through an impressive checklist"" at her new company, ""upending the organizational structure, replacing executives and cutting costs, including 675 jobs, or 5 percent of the workforce."" Analysts described her efforts as precisely what the company required; reporter Alexei Oreskovic observed:

For Yahoo's ranks, still shell-shocked from deep cuts in 2008 – including 1,600 axed jobs – the hope that Bartz brings is increasingly mixed with a dose of fear and uncertainty. Yet broad support remains for Bartz despite the tough talk, canceled holiday parties and forced vacations that have come to define her era.
Staff became anxious over a fresh round of job layoffs and the removal of a number of Yahoo! sites. The situation was then ""exacerbated by a growing sense of secrecy"", for which Bartz has a notable reputation. A need to know agenda replaced the company's typically open internal access to information. Bartz was quoted as saying that she would ""drop-kick to fucking Mars"" employees who leak to the press. Oreskovic quoted a fearful anonymous insider: ""We are all sort of wanting to believe in her because we really want to see Yahoo! turned around, but it still doesn't make it any less scary when you don't hear about what's coming up. Everything is on a need-to-know basis.""At her one-year mark at Yahoo in January 2010, Bartz gave herself a ""B−"" grade for the job done in 2009: ""It was a little tougher internally than I think I had anticipated. I did move fast, but this is a big job."" Others in the media, however, rated her job higher given the challenges she had to manage.When Bartz was hired by Yahoo in early 2009, she was paid an annual base salary of $1 million. She was eligible for an annual 400% bonus and received 5,000,000 shares in addition to an equity grant of $18 million of stock (to compensate for the forfeiture of the value of equity grants and post-employment medical coverage from her previous employer). In 2010 Bartz was named ""most overpaid"" CEO by proxy voting firm Glass-Lewis when she received $47.2 million in compensation.On September 6, 2011, Bartz was removed from her position at Yahoo! (via phone call by Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock), and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company. Bartz notes that Roy was physically 20 minutes away from her when she was fired, noting that ""he didn't have the nerve to see [her] face to face"" and later stated that the board ""fucked me over"". Bartz expressed her desire to remain on the Board of Directors. However, on September 9, 2011, Bartz resigned from the company's Board of Directors.


=== Corporate board memberships ===
Bartz has been a member of eight public company boards in the last 20 years. As of February 2018, she sits on the board of PlanGrid and Cisco. In December 2017, she was reported to own over fifty-two thousand Cisco shares, worth approximately $1.6 million.Bartz is an investor in Caliva, a cannabis-based business.


== Awards ==
Bartz received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in 2001, which spans more than 140 cities and 50 countries worldwide. In 2005, she was included in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women, and remained appearing in the list for six consecutive years.


== Personal life ==
Bartz is a survivor of breast cancer. She is married to Bill Marr, a former executive at Data General and Sun Microsystems. They have three children: Bill, Meredith, and Layne. Her hobbies include golf, tennis, and gardening.On balancing a career with family, Bartz says: ""I have a belief that life isn't about balance, because balance is perfection ... Rather, it's about catching the ball before it hits the floor.""

38,"Paula Beth Begoun (born November 14, 1953), also known as ""The Cosmetics Cop"", is an American talk radio host, author, and businesswoman. She is the founder of Paula's Choice and Beginning Press Publishing.


== Career ==
Begoun was born in suburban Chicago, Illinois. As a child, Begoun suffered from acne and eczema. She studied science at Northern Illinois University before moving to Washington D.C. in 1978 to work as a professional makeup artist and esthetician. Begoun then relocated to Washington, and opened her own cosmetics stores in Seattle in 1981, adding a business partner a short time later. In 1982, KIRO-TV in Seattle, Washington offered Begoun a consumer/feature reporter position, where she began reporting on the beauty industry as an investigative journalist. At that time she began working on her first book, Blue Eyeshadow Should be Illegal.Begoun had sold her business shares to her partner in 1984, and at the end of 1985 she self-published Blue Eye Shadow Should Be Illegal. The book gained national attention, and resulted in the first of many appearances for Begoun on The Oprah Winfrey Show. She also began writing a syndicated column titled ""Dear Paula,"" and received thousands of letters from women across the nation asking for specific information on various beauty products. These requests inspired Begoun to write Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. The first edition was published in 1992. 
In 2008, Begoun created Beautypedia.com, an online version of Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. The site is a product review database that claims to cover over 45,000 products from more than 300 brands.
In the early 1990s, Begoun began work with a team of cosmetic chemists to develop her own line of cosmetics and skin-care products. She claims that her products offer results based on published, peer-reviewed research, and that her extensive research of the cosmetic industry provided her with the expertise necessary to develop these formulations. In 1995, Begoun began selling her products online. This has led some consumers to question the objectivity of her product reviews. As counter to these concerns, Begoun claims that Paula's Choice is one of the only companies that recommends products other than their own.Begoun remains a consultant for dermatologists, plastic surgeons, major cosmetics companies, news and industry insiders. She positions herself as an internationally recognized authority and consumer advocate for the cosmetics and hair-care industries, and routinely appears on news and talk shows, including CNN, Oprah, The Dr. Oz Show, and The View.

After three terms in the New York State Senate, she was the first woman to be elected to any citywide office in NYC as President of the New York City Council, a position she held until her unsuccessful bid for Mayor of New York in 1985; she was the second to last person to hold this position.


== Early life and education ==
Bellamy was born in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1942, and raised in Scotch Plains, graduating from Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in 1959. She attended Gettysburg College, where she was a member of Delta Gamma, and graduated in 1963. She earned her J.D. degree from New York University School of Law in 1968, and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala from 1963 to 1965.


== Business career ==
Bellamy was a managing director at Bear Stearns from 1990 to 1993, a Principal at Morgan Stanley from 1986 to 1990, and an associate in the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore from 1968 to 1971.

== Political career ==


=== New York State Senate ===
Bellamy was a member of the New York State Senate from 1973 to 1977, sitting in the 180th, 181st and 182nd New York State Legislatures.


=== New York City Council ===
She mounted an uphill campaign for President of the New York City Council in 1977. While her opponents spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in their campaigns, Bellamy carried on with just $90,000 in funds, and, despite her initially low public profile, managed to finish a strong second in the Democratic primary with 25 percent of the vote, behind the incumbent Paul O'Dwyer, who got 30 percent, and ahead of City Councilman Carter Burden, Assemblyman Leonard Stavisky and developer Abe Hirschfeld. Because no candidate had received at least 40 percent, O'Dwyer and Bellamy met in a runoff two weeks later, which she won handily, getting 58 percent of the vote. In the November general election, she easily beat the Republican candidate, Assemblyman John Esposito, by a 5-to-1 margin, becoming the first woman elected to citywide office in New York.

43,"Leslie Cohen Berlowitz (March 1, 1944 – June 13, 2020) was president and chief executive officer of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
Berlowitz became the academy's executive officer in 1996 and was later promoted to chief executive officer and President. From 1969 to 1996, Berlowitz was an administrator at New York University.  In 2013 the Boston Globe pointed to a falsification of her degree on Academy grant applications and that her Academy salary appeared higher than standards at comparable institutions. The Globe also brought her draconian management style into question.


== Education ==
Berlowitz graduated from the Fieldston School, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree from Columbia University.  
She was named an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Northeastern University in May 2011.


== American Academy leadership ==
As chief executive, Berlowitz won praise for increasing Academy revenues, expanding the scope of programs, and raising the academy's national profile, though questions about her management style and  allegedly poor treatment of employees followed her for years. Berlowitz led the academy's Strategic Plan ""2001 and Beyond"" and the development of the Initiative for the Humanities and its Humanities Indicators. She created a network of more than 50 University Affiliates to work with the academy on issues vital to the higher education community and also established two residential fellowship programs for young scholars: the Visiting Scholars Program and the Hellman Fellowship in Science and Technology Policy.


=== Resignation ===
In June 2013, Berlowitz was accused by the Boston Globe of embellishing her résumé in the course of writing grant proposals for the American Academy, falsely claiming to have earned a PhD degree in English from New York University.  Berlowitz was also accused of drawing excessive compensation and manipulating the academy's election process. Following calls by the Washington Post and the Boston Globe for her resignation, Berlowitz resigned her position in July 2013. In the wake of press attacks on Berlowitz, however, former Ambassador to Afghanistan and U.S. Army Lt. General Karl Eikenberry and former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen wrote to the Boston Globe in her support.


== Selected works ==
The Common Reader published a version of a chapter of Berlowitz's forthcoming book Bernard Malamud: The Limits of Desire. Berlowitz has also co-edited three books: Restoring Trust in American Business (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005) with Jay W. Lorsch and Andy Zelleke, America in Theory (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988) with Denis Donoghue and Louis Menand, and Greenwich Village: Culture and Counterculture (New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1990) with Richard Eric Beard.

After graduating in 1939, Monroe joined John Kirkwood’s group at Cornell University. She also worked in the Explosives Research Laboratory in Bruceton, Pennsylvania during the war years. Her research on explosive lenses contributed to the implosion-type atom bomb used in the Trinity test and on Nagasaki.In 1941, she married Fitzhugh Willets Boggs (1911–1971). After the birth of their son David (1945–2000), who had developmental disabilities following an infection, she became involved in advocacy and the development of public policy for people with disabilities.


== Research achievements ==
Elizabeth Monroe is famous for having predicted in 1941, with John G. Kirkwood, in the Journal of Chemical Physics, that a system of hard spheres would undergo a liquid-solid phase transition.

55,"Nina Bourne (1916–2010) was a publishing executive for more than 70 years for both Simon & Schuster and Alfred A. Knopf. She was known for her marketing and advertising campaigns for many books including Catch-22 and the Eloise series of children's books.


== Early and personal life ==
Nina Bourne was born on June 16, 1916, in Warsaw and arrived in New York when she was five years old. Bourne attended the Fieldston School and Radcliffe, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1937.Bourne did not marry but ""adopted"" many of her friend's children as her own.


== Career ==
Bourne began her career in 1939 at Simon & Schuster by writing an application letter in the form of a poem that incorporated the names of the publisher's top authors and bestselling book titles. Her first position was as a secretary to co-founder Richard Simon. Working with Jack Goodman, she developed a flair for writing advertising copy.
Bourne described her early days at Simon & Schuster as magic, ""I was so taken with the snazzy ads written by Dick Simon. We called him 'Boss,' because he didn't have to please anybody. He just wrote. And his ads were complete and straightforward and conversational and factual, and terrific.""After Goodman's death in 1957 Bourne took over writing The Inner Sanctum, a news-like advertorial that appeared in both the New York Times Book Review and Publishers Weekly. The Inner Sanctum was also the name of a Simon & Schuster mystery line and Max Schuster and Dick Simon were the original authors for the column.Bourne created ad campaigns for many blockbuster titles including Catch-22, Eloise, and The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  Bourne's campaign for Catch-22 beginning in 1961 is now considered to be a classic for both advertising and publishing students. A personal champion for the book, Bourne placed large advertisements that reported on its progress in the marketplace with a listing of prominent authors who praised the book and also quoting reviews from ordinary readers. This campaign continued for over a year reporting with progress reports to the past and future readers and even included a Happy Birthday notice. The hardcover only sold 35,000 in its first print run but picked up steam when published in paperback by Dell. The paperback sold almost a million copies by 1962. Of Catch-22, Bourne said to Gottlieb, ""I'm like the demented governess who thinks the baby is her own.""Bourne created the advertising campaign for Kay Thompson's Eloise books with the tag line, ""A book for precocious grown-ups.""Bourne also came up with the title for the book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The author, William Shirer, was working on the book with editor Joe Barnes with the tentative title of Hitler's Nightmare Empire. No one liked the title and it was Bourne who after looking at the cover suggested they use the sub-title as the full title.In 1966, Bourne was appointed the vice-president of advertising for Simon & Schuster.In 1968, Gottlieb, Bourne, and Schulte moved to Alfred A. Knopf after Bob Bernstein the CEO of Random House said to them, ""Other people can offer you a job. I can offer you a publishing house. If you come, the three of you can run Knopf."" Bourne remained vice-president until 2009. Of her long-term stay, Bourne said to Jane Friedman, ""The most amazing thing happened to me, Jane. One day I went downstairs for a pack of cigarettes at Simon & Schuster, and by the time I got upstairs twenty-nine years had gone by."" At Knopf, Bourne developed their brand featuring large, clean, heavily bordered ads in black and white with minimal copy.Upon meeting Bourne in 2005, Al Silverman described her, ""Nina came out of the elevator with a little smile on her face. It had to be her. Looking closer, I saw that her face was absolutely untouched by age. She had a small hat over small bangs, giving her that Anita Loos look. But she was prettier than Loos. Eighty-nine years old she was still working for Knopf four days a week, doing the same work she had done for Simon & Schuster way back when--reading manuscripts, writing flap copy, helping with the ads, originating book titles, fighting for the books she thought must be acquired.""Alice Quinn, a former senior editor for Knopf and also the poetry editor at the New Yorker described Bourne as a ""great, great mentor to me and many other people.""Aside from her career in publishing, Bourne occasionally published light verse in the New Yorker.

59,"Janice Brandt is an American businesswoman and vice chair emeritus of America Online/Time Warner. She is known for her direct marketing campaign at AOL that increased the number of subscribers from 200,000 to more than 22 million.


== Early life and education ==
Jan Brandt was born in Brooklyn, New York and moved to New Jersey at the age of eight. She graduated from Boston University's School of Public Communications. Following graduation, she began working as a copywriter at Xerox Education Publications in Middletown, Connecticut. She enrolled in night courses at the University of Connecticut and decided to switch careers to marketing.


== Career ==
After a brief period working for Colonial Penn in Philadelphia, Brandt moved to Palo Alto, California, to join Education Today publishing with Thomas O. Ryder, where she worked for 10 years. She then briefly returned to Xerox Education Publications, which by then had been acquired by Newfield Publications, before being hired by Steve Case as vice president of marketing of AOL in 1993.


=== AOL ===
Brandt was hired with the explicit goal to grow the subscriber base and was given free rein over AOL's marketing strategies. After AOL began sending complimentary discs to people who requested them, Brandt set up a direct marketing campaign to distribute AOL installation diskettes in the mail. The trial campaign cost $250,000 and had an average response of over 10% uptake, with some mailing lists pulling as high as 16-18%. This prompted Brandt to expand the campaign beyond direct mailing and start working with nonconventional distribution partners, such as airlines and cereal companies. At one point, 50% of the CDs produced worldwide had an AOL logo. This ""carpet bombing"" strategy was instrumental in moving AOL beyond Prodigy and CompuServe to dominate the online service provider market.In 2002, Brandt stepped down as vice chair and chief marketing officer of AOL to take a part-time consulting position.Brandt was named twice by Fortune Magazine as one of the ""50 Most Powerful Women in American Business"", in 1999 and again in 2000.
