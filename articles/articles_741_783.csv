0,"Deena Varshavskaya is the founder and CEO of Wanelo (“wah-nee-loh,” from Want, Need, Love) a digital mall where users can discover and buy products from anywhere online. She lives in San Francisco, California.


== Early life ==
Varshavskaya was born and raised in Yakutia, Eastern Siberia, by a stay-at-home mother and a political journalist father. Her parents divorced when she was 16; she, along with her father's family, moved to the United States. She studied psychology, computer science and film studies at Cornell University, but dropped out two courses short of graduating.


== Career ==
After dropping out of Cornell, Varshavskaya moved to New York City and launched her first web startup, ReelACT, a talent video directory for actors. She then moved to Los Angeles and worked for a social network doing product management and user experience design for two years.After this, Varshavskaya was founder and CEO of experience design agency, Dynamik Interactive, where she worked with large-scale consumer web properties designing digital and social experiences.Varshavskaya came up with the concept for Wanelo in 2006 after realizing the need for a different online shopping environment that empowers the individual. Varshavskaya wanted to know what her friends were shopping for, but there was not yet an existing platform that made online social shopping easy. In April 2011, Varshavskaya moved to San Francisco to raise funding. After 40 investor rejections, she closed her first round of funding and launched the company in 2012. As of August 2013, Wanelo has 11 million registered users. The company has raised $14 million in funding.In early 2021, Varshavskaya became an early user of the start-up social media app, Clubhouse.  She quickly established herself as an influencer and key contributor in the vibrant cryptocurrency community that has formed on the platform.  Considered a Bitcoin maximalist, she prescribes to the idea that ""the conditions that led to the launch and bootstrapping of the Bitcoin economy can't or won't repeat"" and that ""while some may tolerate the wider market for cryptocurrencies, this is only so long as it validates Bitcoin's dominance.""

She was featured as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs in 2013 and 2014 by Goldman Sachs.

1,"Seema Verma (born September 26, 1970) is a General Manager and Senior Vice President at Oracle Corporation. She is the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the Donald Trump administration. During her tenure, she was involved in efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as well as reduce Medicaid benefits and increase restrictions on Medicaid. She was embroiled in ethics and legal controversies related to her use of taxpayer money while in office.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Virginia, Verma was a first-generation Indian American. She and her family moved several times, living in small towns such as Joplin, Missouri, and larger cities such as the Washington D.C. area. She also lived in Taiwan for five years while growing up. In 1988, she graduated from Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland. Verma's father, Jugal Verma, said his daughter ""grew up in a Democratic household.”Verma received a bachelor's degree in life sciences from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1993. She earned a Master of Public Health, with a concentration in health policy and management, from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in 1996.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
Verma was vice president of the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County, and worked at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials in Washington, D.C.


=== SVC, Inc. ===
Verma founded health policy consulting firm SVC, Inc., in June 2001. She was president and CEO of the company, which has worked with state insurance agencies and public health agencies in preparation for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and assisted Indiana and Kentucky, as well as other states, in the design of Medicaid expansion programs under the ACA. In her work with Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, she developed Medicaid reform programs under the Section 1115 waiver process.


==== Ethics controversy ====
In 2014, significant ethics concerns were raised over a conflict of interest arising from Verma's dual roles as both a health care consultant for the State of Indiana and as an employee of a Hewlett-Packard division that is among Indiana's largest Medicaid vendors. As of 2011, SVC, Inc. had been awarded over $6.6 million in contracts from the State of Indiana, while Verma was concurrently employed with Hewlett-Packard, earning her over $1 million during a period when the company had secured $500 million in State of Indiana contracts. In 2016, her firm collected $316,000 for work done for the State of Kentucky as a subcontractor for Hewlett-Packard, according to documents obtained by the AP through public records requests. Richard Painter, former President George W. Bush’s chief ethics lawyer, called Verma’s arrangement a “conflict of interest” that “clearly should not happen and is definitely improper.” Ethics experts noted this conflicted with her public duties.


=== Trump administration ===
On November 29, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Verma to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, and the insurance markets. On March 13, 2017, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination in a 55–43 vote. She was sworn into office on the Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is, a translation and commentary of the Bhagavad Gita by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.One of her first actions was to send a letter to the nation's governors, urging them to impose insurance premiums for Medicaid, charge Medicaid recipients for emergency room visits, and encourage recipients to obtain employment or job training as a requirement for Medicaid coverage. She was supportive of President Trump signing into law legislation that permitted states to withhold federal funds from facilities that provide abortions.Verma is a harsh critic of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) calling it a ""failure"". Throughout her tenure at CMS, she led President Trump's charge to repeal and replace Obamacare. Verma made substantial cuts to the ACA Navigator program, making it more difficult for individuals to obtain coverage during open enrollment. On July 25, 2018, Verma gave a speech in San Francisco in which she criticized proposals for ""Medicare for all"". She stated that single-payer health care would destroy Medicare, which provides insurance for elderly people, and lead to ""Medicare for None.""Politico reported that Verma clashed with HHS Secretary Alex Azar over which plans would replace Obamacare, who would get credit for those efforts, and Verma's attempts to accompany the President on Air Force One instead of Azar. Verma accused Azar of sex discrimination; an inquiry by a former Trump HHS official, Heather Flick, concluded that Azar had not discriminated. It was not the first clash Verma had with high-level officials. Flick's inquiry reportedly said Verma had discussed with a lawyer a possible hostile work environment claim against then-HHS Secretary Tom Price; Verma denied she had done this.The clashes extended to co-workers at CMS, as Verma was cited by her first Chief of Staff in an HHS investigative report as being ""insecure"" and someone who ""lashes out"" at subordinates. Verma quickly assigned her next Chief of Staff to Baltimore, ""shutting him out"" of her inner circle in Washington. Verma ultimately cycled through 5 Chiefs of Staff and 5 Medicaid directors during her term. Modern Healthcare reported that Verma's subordinate and former Medicaid director abruptly quit the agency after a disagreement ""erupted"" between them. This led Verma to ban the Modern Healthcare reporter from future media calls with CMS. The president of the Association of Health Care Journalists condemned this action as ""bullying"" and commented that ""Verma seems to think she can bury inconvenient facts by threatening reporters with blacklisting.""On March 2, 2020, the office of Vice President Mike Pence announced Verma's addition to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.In the weeks leading up to the 2020 election, she pushed Medicare career civil servant officials to finalize a plan to issue $200 cards before the November 3 election, branded with Trump's name, for Medicare recipients to use on drugs. The taxpayer-funded plan was estimated to cost $7.9 billion and draw from Medicare's trust fund.One of the priorities during her tenure as CMS administrator was to make it possible for states to implement work requirements for Medicaid. The Biden administration sought to reverse those moves. She submitted her resignation from the Trump administration 7 days after the 2021 United States Capitol insurrection.


==== Ethics and legal investigations ====
On August 20, 2018, Verma filed a claim requesting that taxpayers reimburse her for jewelry she alleged was stolen on a work-related trip to San Francisco. Although she requested $47,000, she ultimately received $2,852.40 in reimbursement. Democratic Representative Joe Kennedy III called on Verma to resign immediately, calling her actions a taxpayer ""bailout for stolen goods she chose not to insure"".In March 2019, Politico reported that in her role as CMS administrator, Verma approved communications subcontracts worth more than $2 million of taxpayer funds to Republican-connected communications consultants and other expenses to boost her visibility and public image, leading to federal ethics and criminal investigations. Included in the consultants' work were proposals to have Verma featured in magazines like Glamour and have her invited to prestigious events to increase her public persona. Verma made an effort to purchase awards and honors for herself using taxpayer dollars. In July 2020, the HHS Inspector General reported that Verma spent more than $5 million in taxpayer funds to do communications work, and to help raise her profile. The report, a result of a 15-month investigation, concluded that Verma violated federal contracting rules: ""CMS improperly administered the contracts and created improper employer-employee relationships between CMS and the contractors"".In September 2020, Democrats on four congressional committees concluded  that she ""may have violated federal law,"" leading Congress to request a formal legal opinion from the Government Accountability Office. The report from GAO, issued in 2023, concluded that CMS did not violate the purpose statute, publicity or propaganda prohibition, or publicity experts prohibition when it obligated appropriations for task orders for communication services.Verma spent more than $3.5 million on Republican Party-aligned consultants to promote her. Verma spent nearly $3,000 in taxpayer dollars on consulting fees for organizing a ""Girl's Night"" party thrown in her honor, hundreds of dollars for makeup artists, as well as $13,000 to promote herself to win awards and appear on panels. Verma's consultants aimed to place her on profile-enhancing lists, such as the Washingtonian's ""Most Powerful Women in Washington"" list, targeted media outlets for Verma with no clear connection to CMS initiatives (such as ""Badass Women of DC""), and generated ideas for potential social events for Verma to attend, such as the Ford's Theatre Gala, Kennedy Center Honors, and Motion Picture Association events. The consultants provided her with talking points on repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and helped her write a 2018 opinion column under her name in the Washington Post, arguing for Medicaid work requirements. Verma billed CMS up to $380 per hour for her travel entourage, as well as drivers at a rate up to $203 per hour and hotel rooms that cost more than $500 per night. Because these consultants led communications efforts on major policy initiatives and rollouts, CMS leadership provided them with access to sensitive information on proposed rule-makings, internal plans for anticipated policy roll-outs, and other potentially non-public, market-sensitive information. One of the outside consultants that Verma paid was Marcus Barlow, who had been her spokesperson at her former consulting firm SVC and who worked on three separate contracts for CMS. According to the New York Times,  Barlow's earnings between $209–$230 an hour worked out to more than double the salary he would have received as a federal employee. As late as December 2020 during Verma's tenure, Barlow accompanied Verma and other CMS officials to an official function at the White House.In 2021, Verma said she lost her CMS-issued cell phone two days before President Biden's inauguration, resulting in the elimination of all of its stored records. Verma then failed to complete the standard form explaining how she lost her phone, the court records state. Verma was issued a new iPhone on January 18, which she returned nine days later. Records from that phone can not be accessed because the phone was locked and Verma said she had forgotten her passcode.


=== Post-Trump administration career ===
Verma told reporters she had ""no regrets"" about her actions or tenure Verma joined the board of multiple healthcare firms. She is a General Manager and Senior Vice President at Oracle, reporting to Mike Sicilia.


== Personal life ==
Born in Virginia, Verma moved several times across the United States with her family, and once lived in Taiwan for five years, before settling in the greater Indianapolis area. Verma and her family live in Carmel, Indiana.

3,"Lillian Vernon (born Lilli Menasche; March 18, 1927 – December 14, 2015) was an American businesswoman and philanthropist. She founded the Lillian Vernon Corporation in 1951 and served as its chairwoman and CEO until July 1989, though she continued to serve as executive chairwoman until 2003, when the company was taken private by Zelnick Media. When it went public in 1987, Lillian Vernon Corporation was the first company traded on the American Stock Exchange founded by a woman. New York University's Lillian Vernon Writers House is named after her and houses the University's prestigious creative writing program.


== Early life ==
Lillian Vernon was born Lilli Menasche in Leipzig, Germany in 1927 to Erna Feiner Menasche and Herman Menasche, a successful dry goods merchant (she later changed her name to Vernon, borrowing it from Mount Vernon, New York, where she settled with her first husband Samuel Hochberg). In 1933, Vernon's brother was attacked by an anti-Jewish mob, and the family fled Nazi Germany to Amsterdam. The family emigrated to the United States in 1937.Taking up residence in New York City, her father, Herman Menasche, sold lingerie and later established a manufacturing company that specialized in leather goods, many of which were designed by Vernon. Vernon became a U.S. citizen in 1942. Her brother, Fred Menasche, later enlisted in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and she joined a Woman's Auxiliary Canteen in support of the war effort. Fred Menasche, serving in Normandy, was killed in a grenade attack.Vernon attended New York University from 1947 to 1949. In 1949, Vernon married Samuel Hochberg, who worked in his parents' women's clothing store. To supplement their family income, Vernon started a mail order service from the kitchen of her Mount Vernon home. She named the service the Vernon Specialties Company.


== Business career ==


=== Lillian Vernon Corporation ===

At the age of twenty-four, using her combined wedding gifts, Vernon invested $2,000 in the business and placed her first advertisement in Seventeen magazine for personalized purses and belts. She received an overwhelming response and her business was launched. In the first years, the size of the business was limited to Vernon and her kitchen table, where she sorted and filled orders. The Vernon Specialties Company focused primarily on products for young women, advertising in magazines focused on that emergent market. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Vernon and Hochberg began to create their own jewelry, which they sold through the catalog. One particularly successful product, a magnetized bobby pin cup, attracted the interest of Revlon in 1962. Revlon offered them a distribution contract shortly thereafter. Other cosmetics companies including Elizabeth Arden, Max Factor, and Maybelline followed suit.In 1969, Hochberg and Vernon divorced and split the company, with Hochberg taking over the wholesale division and Vernon continuing the catalog. In the 1970s, the company began to retool its strategy to draw from, and sell to, a global market. Lillian Vernon began to travel to European trade fairs in an effort to expand the catalog's offerings to include European products. In 1980, Vernon was one of the first American merchants to travel to China after President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit. In order to expand her brand, Vernon started The New Company, a brass manufacturer, and Provender, the Lillian Vernon Company's wholesale division, which sold Lillian Vernon brand toiletries and kitchen supplies.The Lillian Vernon Corporation, founded in 1965, went public in 1987, making her the first woman to found a company publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Lillian Vernon Catalog, which the company launched in 1956, became an iconic shopping resource for American women, much like its competitor, the Sears catalog. Produced monthly, the catalog was typically 120 pages and usually featured 750 items. In response to a catalog and shopping mall boom in the United States in the 1980s, the company produced a number of specialty catalogs in order to broaden its market, including ones targeted for children and homemakers.Her two sons were also working in the business. Her older son, Fred Hochberg, upon receiving his MBA from Columbia University, joined the company full time in 1975. From 1975 until his departure in 1993 as president and COO, he oversaw a 40-fold increase in sales and moving the company's distribution and telemarketing center to Virginia Beach, VA. In 1993, her son, Fred left the company to advocate for LGBTQ civil rights and enter public service in the Clinton administration.
Responding to the increasingly important online market in the early 1990s, the Lillian Vernon Corporation opened a storefront on AOL in 1995 and followed with an online catalog and website. However, by the end of the 1990s, the company began to struggle to meet online needs, especially after the collapse of the dot-com bubble. Vernon sold it to Zelnick Media in 2003, but retained the symbolic title of non-executive chairman. Her son, David remained with the company along with Vernon after the sale. The company has since changed hands a number of times. As of 2008 it is owned by the Taylor Corporation.


== Later career ==
In 1997, Vernon was appointed to head President Bill Clinton's White House National Business Women's Council, which she became the chairwoman of for many years. She was the first member of the American Business Conference. She has been a strong supporter of the Democratic Party for many years, supporting the presidential campaigns of President Clinton, President Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, among others. She has also supported the Democratic National Committee, Emily's List, and the Women's Campaign Fund.


=== The Lillian Vernon Writers House ===

In addition to hosting the offices of the program, the Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House serves as ""a vibrant New York literary landmark known for its lively readings and salons."" The House hosts classes, workshops, master classes by visiting writers as well as readings and book launches. Since 2007, the Lillian Vernon Writers House has hosted the release readings of NYU's literary journal Washington Square, and has hosted many prominent writers, including CAConrad, Mary Ruefle, Colm Tóibín Jorie Graham, and Charles Simic.  Vernon's sons, David and Fred Hochberg and Fred Hochberg's life partner, Tom Healy, continue to support the creative writing program. 


=== Philanthropic work ===
During and after her time at the Lillian Vernon Corporation, Lillian Vernon served on the board of a number of organizations, including Lincoln Center, the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Citymeals-on-Wheels, New York University. Both the company and Ms Vernon were widely known for their generosity to civic and non-profit organizations. Recipients of these donations included the U.S. Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, Literacy Volunteers of America and a number of other charities. She founded the Lillian Vernon Foundation, a charitable organization that supports organizations in New York City and around the country, including Citymeals-on-Wheels. In 2011, Vernon was honored with the project Sunshine Award for Philanthropic Leadership.  Vernon was an early champion for women's rights in the workplace. The Women's Enterprise Center created the Lillian Vernon Award, which is awarded to enterprising women who have served their community, in honor of Vernon's support of women's rights.


=== Awards and recognition ===
In 1998, Vernon, a longtime resident of Connecticut, was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. She was inducted the Direct Marketing Association's Hall of Fame.

== Death ==
Vernon died on December 14, 2015, in Manhattan, New York, aged 88.


== Popular culture ==
Several well-known actors began their careers as Lillian Vernon models, including Jason Biggs, Monica Potter, and Marla Maples. The company was the inspiration for MADtv's The Lillian Verner Game Show, which was a regular game show skit that featured contestants competing for spoof Lillian Vernon products. Vernon is also referenced in John Cameron Mitchell's musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch in the song ""Sugar Daddy"". YouTube star Casey Neistat and his brother Van traveled with Vernon to her birthplace in Leipzig and made a video about her life.

== Early life and education ==
Visram was born in Toronto to immigrants from Pakistan and Tanzania. At the age of three, she moved with her parents and brother to Birmingham, Alabama, where they lived in a room at the motel the family operated. Visram says that owning their own business was her parents’ biggest source of both stress and pride. She credits her entrepreneurial parents for their example.Visram graduated from Indian Springs School in Indian Springs, AL before attending Columbia University, where she received her BA in History and Visual Arts in 1999, and later her MBA from Columbia Business School (‘04) in Management and Entrepreneurship.In 1999, Visram was the first employee in Horizon Media's interactive division. Following her time at Horizon, Visram founded Maven Marketing, her own digital marketing and media consultancy.


=== Career ===


==== Founding Happy Family ====
While attending Columbia Business School, Visram began writing her business plan for Happy Family after chatting with a friend, who admitted to feeling guilty about not being able to make homemade food for her babies. Visram discovered that many parents wanted access to healthy, organic options that weren't available at that time.After a brief round of investment from family and friends—the first person to write a check to the company was Visram's mother, Zarin—Visram raised $23 million from 186 individual investors from 2004 to 2012, including Honest Tea CEO Seth Goldman, chef Tom Colicchio, and actress Demi Moore.


==== 2006–2013: Growth, initiatives, and sale to Danone ====
In 2006, Visram, along with Founding Partner and COO Jessica Rolph, formally launched Happy Family, known at the time as Happy Baby. In May 2013, Visram sold 92% of the company to Groupe Danone, noting ""the broader opportunity we weren't able to tap into"" provided by Danone to bring more than 100 products to market in 34 countries. Following the sale, Visram remained CEO until December 2017.


==== 2014–present ====
In 2014, Visram partnered with The Small Things to open the Happy Family Children’s Village, in memory of her father, Amir Visram. The village, which housed 45 children as of 2016, provides education and nutrition to Tanzanian children separated from their families, and prepares them to assume leadership roles in their communities. Upon the opening, Visram said, “I believe that all children deserve to be happy, and oftentimes that starts with the little things, like access to nutritious food and a proper education.”
Under Visram in 2016, Happy Family launched the first see-through organic baby food pouch—Happy Baby Clearly Crafted—a development followed by rival baby food brands. 2016 also saw the publication of Visram’s second book, “The Happy Family Organic Superfoods Cookbook for Baby & Toddler” with Cricket Azima.The following year, in 2017, Happy Family released a new organic infant formula and “infant support platform with expert resources and premium products,” along with the Happy Mama Milk Mentors, a support team for breastfeeding moms. About the correlation between the two, Visram said, “No matter what, we believe we need to be there for parents at every turn to support the individual choices that work for their very individual families.”
Happy Family generated revenue surpassing $150 million for the first time in 2017. Visram envisions the company as a billion dollar brand. In December 2017, Visram transitioned from her position as CEO of Happy Family, while maintaining her role as chief visionary and ""Chairmom"" of the board.
