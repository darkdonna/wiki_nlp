0,"Natasha Gajewski (née Rana) is the CEO and Founder of Symple Health.


== Early life and education ==
Gajewski was born to Dana Roy and Riaz Hussein Rana. Her father, Rana, was a commercial pilot and later statistician. Rana immigrated to the United States from Zafar Chowk, Pakistan in 1960. Gajewski has one sister, Holly Bossard. Gajewski has a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Statistics from Rutgers University.


== Career ==
After being diagnosed, in 2010, with the rare condition, Mixed connective tissue disease (MTCD), Gajewski was told by her physician to keep track of her symptoms between medical appointments. This motivated her to improve health prospects for patients. This led to the idea to create a mobile symptom journal. Gajewski was initially faced with the prohibitive costs of developing a Mobile app after approaching developers from the United States and India. To evaluate the feasibility and validity of the app, she attend Eric Ries's 2011 Lean startup - San Francisco where her idea was the 2nd-place winner and was voted ""most fundable"" and ""most likely to succeed."" In a February 2017 Heart Sisters interview, Gajewksi said of her experience designing a mobile app:But there wasn’t [already a mobile app], so I went about making my own. Because I was actively sick at the time, I knew certain things that a healthy person might completely miss – something as simple as not using sliders on a screen because they’re harder to activate (and require more thought) than a button.
She has been described as a ""revolutionary"" in the engaged patient movement along with Dave deBronkart and Jamie Heywood. In 2014, the Symple App had 60,000 users. It is distributed through the App Store (iOS). In 2016, Symple was recommended by a National Health Service general practitioner, Dr. Golda Parker, for patients to use to create lists of symptoms so they come prepared to appointments. Gajewski's Symple app has been the subject of research in academic journals. A 2017 academic study rated her mobile app as one of the ""highest performing apps"" for heart failure monitoring. Gajewski provided input on point of care patient decisions in a 2016 study. Danny Gorog of Macworld had positive remarks on the App, stating that it "" is a powerful iPhone app that lets users track up to 20 different symptoms at once. It also functions as a health diary, to let you note the things you eat, daily exercise and medications you take.""


== Advisory boards ==
Gajewski serves as an Advisor for Princeton University's Keller Center eLab Summer Accelerator. She is also a member of University of California, San Diego and Irvine's Health Data Exploration Project. In December 2011, Gajewski was one of the Princeton alumni and women entrepreneurs and business leaders who served as a panelist for the event entitled ""Women in Entrepreneurship"" hosted by the Keller Center. The panel explored the underrepresentation of women in venture capital and startup ventures to which, Gajewski reported ""I just never imagined limitations based on my sex.” Later remarking, “It just never occurred to me."" Gajewski is a faculty member for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sponsored National Health Care Transparency Summit. Gajewski serves on the Advisory Board of Flip the Clinic, a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

She is the founder and former CEO of Camp Bow Wow, an international pet care franchise. In November 2016, she was elected Regent of the University of Colorado. As of 2024 she is the last Republican to hold statewide office in Colorado.Ganahl was the Republican nominee for governor of Colorado in the 2022 election, losing in a landslide to incumbent Democrat Jared Polis.


== Background and education ==
Ganahl was born in Orange County, California where she lived until she was 12. Her family then moved to Monument, Colorado, where she attended Lewis-Palmer High School. She earned a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Colorado Boulder, followed by a master's degree in healthcare administration from the University of Denver. In the spring of 1994, her husband, Bion Flammang, died in a plane crash.


== Career ==
In her early years, Ganahl worked for the advertising firms Chapman Warwick and Salvati Montgomery Sakoda. She then held positions in account management at DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Rhone Poulenc (now Sanofi-Aventis), and founded the Maginot Group. She also launched a baby room catalog company, Nursery Works. In 2000, she launched Camp Bow Wow, which is now North America's largest and fastest-growing pet care franchise. Camp Bow Wow was acquired in August 2014 by VCA, Inc. Ganahl is also the founder and president of the Colorado-based Fight Back Foundation, which funds and mentors social entrepreneurs seeking to help kids in Colorado.
In 2015, Ganahl was appointed by Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper to the School Safety and Youth in Crisis Committee established by Colorado Senate Bill 15-214, to study school safety and threat prevention in public and private schools, programs and methods for identifying and monitoring students in crisis, standardized protocols for school personnel for assessing potential threats, and the implementation of the Claire Davis School Safety Act.In 2019, Ganahl launched the lifestyle brand SheFactor.


== CU Board of Regents ==
Ganahl was elected to the CU Board of Regents as an at-large member in 2016. She wants to see more conservatives (student, staff and faculty levels) at the university. Ganahl also recently sponsored an anti-critical race theory proposition in an effort that was seen as an attempt to impose external controls on the academic freedom of faculty at the University of Colorado. The proposition was defeated in a 3--6 vote of the Board. Regents Ganahl, Chance Hill, and Susan Sharkey voted for the proposition.


== 2022 Colorado gubernatorial race ==
On September 10, 2021, Ganahl filed paperwork with the Secretary of State's office indicating that she was seeking the Republican nomination for Governor of Colorado in the 2022 election.On June 28, 2022, Ganahl secured the GOP Nomination for Governor of Colorado. On November 8, 2022, Ganahl lost to Democratic incumbent Jared Polis.


== Political positions ==


=== Trump and the 2020 election ===
Ganahl considers herself to be a supporter of former president Donald Trump. Ganahl has declined to state if the results of the 2020 presidential election are legitimate. After the 2020 presidential election, Ganahl praised John Eastman, a controversial lawyer who incorrectly claimed that Kamala Harris is not an American citizen and wouldn't be eligible to be Vice President. Eastman also helped Trump in his attempts to overturn the election results.In a November 2021 event, Ganahl suggested that winning by large margins will override election fraud, implying that substantial voter fraud exists. In the same event, Ganahl also endorsed a political group that pushes claims of election fraud in the 2020 election. While praising the election system in Colorado, Ganahl also expressed uncertainty over the election process of other states during the 2020 election. Similarly, Ganahl has raised doubt about the election, voicing concern over what she perceived as ""rules being weakened before the [2020] election in some states"".


=== Healthcare ===
In the 2021 legislative session, Ganahl opposed the Colorado Affordable Health Care Option, a measure that aimed at lowering healthcare costs by creating a public health insurance option. Writing an op-ed and referring to a brain tumor she got removed, Ganahl stated “The proposed Colorado Affordable Health Care Option is not the broad solution politicians claim. With unintended consequences to quality and access, it may force hospitals to eliminate some critical functions. It may even endanger miracles like mine.”


=== Education ===
Ganahl is opposed to proposals offering tuition-free enrollment in community colleges. In regards to sexual assault on campus, Ganahl has acknowledged it as a serious issue but has downplayed its prevalence, saying ""Twenty-eight percent of students at CU said that they had been sexually assaulted, but it included all kinds of things like inappropriate touching, and catcalling, etc. “I think the actual rape number was nine percent […] it’s still nine percent too many. But you know, that’s self-reported, so.”Ganahl has claimed that conservatives at colleges are being ""silenced"" and has attempted to form organizations that promote conservative viewpoints on-campus.

Getty is passionate about LGBT rights, climate change, and women's rights, making most of her time and financial contributions to GLAAD and the United Nations foundation. Much of Ariadne's charitable work stems from her personal history; both of her children, Natalia (Nats) and August are gay, and much of Ariadne's philanthropic efforts go towards working with the LGBTQ community.
Getty serves with Queen Rania of Jordan, Muhammad Yunus, Kofi Annan, and Ted Turner as an inaugural board member of the Better World Fund, a nonprofit that provides educational and advocacy support for the United Nations and causes regarding refugees and gender inequality.

During this time, Glimcher worked with mentor Bill Paul, who strongly encouraged her to continue her research independently after completing medical school.
Glimcher currently heads her own lab for research in immunology. She has been interested in studying the ties between ER stress system in neurons and immune function and neuro-degeneration. Her past work has involved regulation of immune function and has shifted towards osteobiology with a focus on the bone disease osteoporosis. Her Harvard lab has a three-year contract with Merck for the drug Fosamax, a treatment for osteoporosis. Glimcher's more current research looks to answer the question, “How does the immune system and the ER stress system impact cancer development and progression?”

== Women's involvement ==
Laurie Glimcher has been considered a champion of women's rights in the scientific community by many of her peers. While she was at Harvard, she hired lab technicians with her own research fund to support her postdoctoral fellows after they had babies so that they were allowed to leave by 6. This carried on into Glimcher's involvement with the National Institutes of Health to create a similar postdoc grant program caring for family members.Glimcher served on the 2005 Larry Summers Task Force for Women in Science and Engineering, where she expressed her disappointment in the rate of progress for women in science. She joined this task force after a controversy was sparked when former Harvard president Larry Summers suggested that women might be able to innately do less in science. Although she was on the Larry Summers committee, Glimcher still believes that there is still more work to be done. She was quoted as saying: ""There are not enough women in senior leadership positions, period. It hasn't gotten a heck of a lot better since I was in medical school."" After she was appointed to Cornell's medical school she immediately made changes regarding women's rights. She established paid maternity leave, created daycare centers and another postdoc grant program for primary caregivers. Upon arriving at Cornell there were 0 out of 19 clinical department chairs filled by women; as of today there are 2.

Glimcher's dual role as Dana Farber CEO and as director of multiple corporate boards was highlighted in the Boston Globe Spotlight article ""Boston’s hospital chiefs moonlight on corporate boards at rates far beyond the national level,"" and resulted in multiple calls among Harvard physicians and Boston hospital staff for the prohibition of hospital executives from serving on corporate boards.


== Data manipulation controversy ==
In January 2024 Glimcher was among four researchers at Dana-Farber accused of falsifying data in research papers. Images in the papers had been manipulated in a way that suggested deliberate attempts to mislead readers.

25,"Lynn J. Good is chair, president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy, a Fortune 500 company. Good is an Ohio native and graduated from Miami University where she earned a BS in Systems Analysis and in Accounting (1981).


== Early life and education ==
Good grew up in Fairfield, Ohio. Her father was a math teacher who later became a high school principal. She earned degrees in accounting and systems analysis from Miami University of Ohio.


== Early career ==
Good became an auditor at the Cincinnati branch of Arthur Andersen & Co. While at Andersen, Good broke the barrier to females playing major roles in auditing when she participated in the audit of Andersen's most prestigious account, Cincinnati Gas & Electric. Good rose to supervise that audit, and in 1992 she became one of Andersen's few women partners. She was also a partner for a time at Deloitte.


== Cinergy ==
Following the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002, Good joined Cinergy Corp. as senior vice president of accounting and finance. In 2005, Good was named executive vice president and chief financial officer of Cinergy. In 2006, following the merger of Cinergy into Duke Energy, Good was named senior vice president and treasurer of Duke in the company's Charlotte, North Carolina, headquarters. She went on to head the unregulated commercial business. Good was named Duke's executive vice president and chief financial officer as of July 2009. She began to make large investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar facilities that sell their power to utilities and towns.


== Duke Energy ==
In 2011 Duke of Charlotte and Progress Energy of Raleigh agreed to merge. The deal stipulated that Progress CEO Bill Johnson was to replace Duke CEO Jim Rogers. But in June 2012, on the day that the deal closed, the board fired Johnson and re-hired Rogers instead. North Carolina regulators, following an investigation, reached an agreement with Duke in which the company was required to choose a new CEO by the middle of 2013. Good was selected by a board composed of both Duke and Progress members.
Lynn Good became CEO of Duke Energy on July 1, 2013. Good was also elected to the Duke board. In 2016, she was elected chairman of the board. In 2018, Duke Energy awarded Good just under $14 million in total compensation.Good is one of the most highly compensated women executives in the United States.


== Energy policy positions ==


=== Carbon capture and storage ===
The Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) held a wide-ranging interview of Good on June 21, 2018; among the topics were carbon capture and sequestration. Carbon capture and storage technology can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions made from a fossil fuels electricity generation plant, thus releasing much less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Good told CSIS that the carbon capture and sequestration process was not quite ready for general use, even though it has potential for keeping fossil fuels in the power-generation mix. According to Daily Energy Insider, ""On paper, a gas or coal plant that does not release carbon dioxide into the air would be a logical asset to fill in any lags in purely green power production”, but Good indicated that while Duke was still collaborating on various research projects involving carbon capture, the big breakthroughs necessary to launch a commercially viable carbon-capture plant were not yet in sight.""

32,"Sara K. Gould is a feminist leader, philanthropist and activist in the United States. She served as president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women from 2004 to 2010. She is a vice chair on the board of directors of the National Immigration Law Center and serves on the board of the Proteus Fund.


== Biography ==
Gould grew up in Grand Haven, Michigan with five brothers and sisters. She was raised in a Christian background and as a young person was very involved in the church. Later, as an adult, she became ""much more secular."" In 1973, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science from Grand Valley State University. Gould was married at age twenty and she followed her husband to Syracuse where he was attending law school. During her time in Syracuse, she began to see that she was following his dream instead of her own. Gould realized that she was ""viewing her life through the prism of gender"" and shortly after she left her marriage and went to graduate school at Harvard University. She received her master's degree in city and regional planning from Harvard in 1977.


== Work ==
After graduating from Harvard, Gould went to work in Massachusetts with Community Development Corporations (CDCs), but she didn't feel fulfilled by the work. In 1983, the Women's Action Alliance in New York called Gould to work on a project with them involving women's economic development.At the time, the Women's Action Alliance and the Ms. Foundation for Women shared space in the same building. In 1986, Gould joined the Ms. Foundation. Gould began to identify economic development organizations throughout the country and began a grassroots program to help women identify their own seats of economic power.In 1988, Gould started the Institute for Women's Economic Development under the Tufts University umbrella.In 1990, she created the Collaborative Fund for Women's Economic Development (CFWED), one of the first of its kind in the country. Gould relates that at the time, ""the words 'women' and 'economic development' were not put in the same sentence; they were almost like an oxymoron."" The project involved multiple funders to pool money together into a larger sum in order to lower individual groups' risk. There were several ""anchor"" funders who contributed half a million each, such as the Levi Strauss Foundation and the Charles Steward Mott Foundation. The CFWED allowed the Ms. Foundation to give out fifteen large grants for the first time.She contributed the piece ""Owning the Future: Women Entrepreneurs"" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan.Gould served as president for the Ms. Foundation starting in 2004. During her time as president, she expanded grantmaking to further include community project that emphasized sustainable change. When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, she immediately reacted by establishing the Katrina Women's Response Fund which granted $3 million in funds to organizations in Louisiana and Mississippi which helped low income women and women of color rebuild their communities.She has also been a contributor to the Huffington Post.In 2011, Gould was a visiting fellow at the Foundation Center where she worked with Atlantic Philanthropies for two years providing research and activities on social justice philanthropy.After her time at the Foundation Center, she served as associate director of Caring Across Generations, a campaign to help those provide long-term home care, from April 2012 to January 2014.

Interview with Sara Gould on grantmaking (video)"
33,"Phyllis E. Grann (born September 2, 1937) is a former book editor and publishing executive. She was the first female CEO of a major publishing firm, Penguin Putnam, and one of the most commercially successful publishers in recent history. She was a long-time editor for Knopf Doubleday, and a former CEO of the Putnam Berkley Group and was also CEO of Penguin Putnam. Grann was responsible for publishing many notable and bestselling authors at Penguin including A. Scott Berg, Judy Blume, Tom Clancy, Patricia Cornwell, Sue Grafton, Daniel Silva, and Kurt Vonnegut. At Doubleday Grann acquired and edited Jeffrey Toobin, Tina Brown, Bob Herbert, Ayelet Waldman and Tim Weiner. At Knopf she edited John Darnton.


== Early life ==
Phyllis E. Grann was born in London before World War II to Louisa and Solomon Eitingon. Her mother was British and her father was a Russian Jew who had immigrated to Paris. Grann came to New York as a child in 1940 and graduated The Kew-Forest School in 1958. Grann went on to attend school at Barnard College. Grann told the New York Times about early visits to Scribners book store in her childhood. “My mother used to take me to Scribner’s and would leave me with the saleslady in the children’s department,” she said. “I must have been 10 or 11. She’d just leave me sitting there and reading while she went shopping for an hour. It was quite a feeling, to be surrounded by books like that.”


== Career ==
It has been reported that Grann started her publishing career in 1958 as a secretary for Nelson Doubleday—however, because of timing, it is more likely that she was a secretary for his son, Nelson Doubleday, Jr. From there Grann moved over to an editor position at William Morrow. In 1970 Grann joined Simon & Schuster where she was promoted to run Simon & Schuster's mass market paperback imprint, Pocket Books under then CEO Dick Snyder.Unhappy at Simon & Schuster, Grann moved over to Putnam in 1976 to become editor-in-chief. According to Simon & Schuster editor Michael Korda, ""her dazzling success as both and editor and a businesswoman was to serve as a permanent reminder to Dick (Snyder) that he had lost one of the brightest stars in publishing and made her a competitor."" MCA/Universal had purchased Putnam (formerly G. P. Putnam's Sons) in 1975. Stanley Newman, an executive at MCA, Inc. built a new financial strategy model to make Putnam profitable. His model, which Grann ran with, put the emphasis on fewer but more profitable authors who could be published in hardcover and paperback by a coordinated team.Grann proved to be a formidable publisher who took care of her authors while emphasizing sales and the bottom-line. Grann credited MCA President Lew Wasserman for her own emphasis on caring for her authors saying, ""Lew Wasserman taught me that you're only as good as the talent you have under contract and the talent that walks out the door every night. You have to take care of these people."" Grann took Putnam from having $10 million in revenue in 1976 to over $100 million by 1983 by building a publishing list around what she called ""repeaters,"" bestselling authors who could turn out annual bestsellers such as Tom Clancy. Prior to this many publishers focused on publishing name authors every three years or so. Grann recognized that authors could be brands and she focused on creating a list that weighed heavily towards the repeaters. By focusing on the repeaters, Grann stated that a publishing company can ""afford to spend a lot more on its authors than on the machinery of publishing."" Grann also taught editors about the financial ramifications of day-to-day decisions and gave them free rein as long as they made margins.The 1980s saw the publishing industry move toward heavily discounting hardcover titles (sometimes 40-50% off retail price) to fill the shelves at expanding bookstore chains and price clubs. Here Grann also led the charge as she focused on a ""limited number of high-performance books like Tom Clancy's second novel, Red Storm Rising, which sold nearly a million copies in 1986.Under Grann's guidance, and her ""Thursday Morning Breakfast Meetings,"" Putnam continued to grow—from $100 million in revenue in 1983 to $200 million by 1993 without increasing the number of titles published. Grann described the list of about 75 titles: ""25 were repeat bestsellers, 15 were books that we would need a huge campaign to make, 10 were books were just starting things and we didn't know where it was going, and 10 were mistakes we probably shouldn't have published."" Her Thursday morning meetings were described as having a war-room meeting with representatives from every department while Grann made quick decisions.Grann was promoted to CEO of Putnam in 1987.There were a number of quick changes by Grann between 2001 and 2003. In November 2001 Grann joined Random House as vice-chairman. There was initial speculation that the position was created so that it didn't violate a non-compete clause in Grann's contract with Putnam. A publishing insider said of Random House CEO Peter Olson hiring Grann, ""I think maybe instead of buying another company he bought a person."" Grann left Random House after only six months citing ""boredom"" with her advisory role. Grann then returned by January 2003 in a new role as a Senior Editor of the Doubleday Broadway Publishing Group. This new role was to allow Grann to edit and publish about ten titles a year. At the same time Grann was also a member of the advisory board of Leeds Weld & Company, a private equity firm.Grann retired from Knopf Doubleday in 2011.


== Description ==
Grann was described in a New York magazine article as ""a small woman even in heels, with a preternaturally youthful face that leaves you thinking of Barbara Walters.


== Personal life ==
Grann met and married Dr. Victor Grann in 1962 and they have residences in both Westport, Connecticut and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Her husband is an oncologist and the Director of the Bennett Cancer Center in Stamford, Connecticut. They have three children--David Grann (writer), Edward Grann (filmmaker) and Alison Grann (radiation oncologist).

=== 2006 to 2017: HSN ===


==== Arrival at HSN ====
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, ""HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products"". Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her. In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time. One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs. In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel America's Store, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands. She also eliminated negative or ""toxic"" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.She also found that the network and brand itself was a ""very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience"". By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was ""to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers"". To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products. Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel. In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.


==== HSN relaunch and taking the company public ====
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around. In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO. The IPO launched in August 2008. A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014. HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010. Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting. Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a ""hybrid"" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front, Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping. She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence; as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites. She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a ""boundaryless"" retail; according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN. She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week. She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009. As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company. In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering. Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.

== Associate Attorney General (2021-present) ==


=== Nomination ===
On January 7, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Gupta to serve as the United States Associate Attorney General. On March 9, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination.

44,"Kathryn ""Kitty"" Hach-Darrow (October 20, 1922 – June 4, 2020) was an American businesswoman and philanthropist who co-founded the Hach Chemical Company in 1947 with her first husband Clifford C. Hach (pronounced hɑ:k). She was essential to the company's expansion, flying her own plane to small airfields across the country to sell water purification kits. She became president, chief operating officer, and CEO of the Hach company.Kathryn Hach-Darrow was also the first woman director of the American Water Works Association, an international non-profit working for better water quality.  She has been noted for philanthropic work as well as her entrepreneurial success, and has received a number of awards and honors as a result of her contributions to both business and chemistry.


== Early life and education ==
Kathryn Carter was born in Bucklin, Missouri, where her father was an automobile dealer. He was also a pilot, flying his own Eagle Rock biplane. Kitty's first ride in an airplane occurred at the age of 5, the beginning of her lifelong love of flying. Her mother was a schoolteacher.The Great Depression was financially disastrous for the Carter family. Her father did not go bankrupt, but lost his business and his plane.  The family bought a farm in Triplett, Missouri and lived there during Kathryn's teens. Kathryn did well in school and earned money for college by raising and selling turkeys. She initially attended Columbia College, Missouri (then named Christian Female College), before transferring to Iowa State University to study home economics.At Iowa State University, Kitty met Nellie May Naylor, a chemist in the home economics department who interested her in chemistry.


== Marriage and work ==
Kathryn and her first husband Clifford C. Hach met as students at Iowa State University, and married in 1943. ""I knew right away that this guy was going to build a chemical company,"" she says. ""He didn't care how big Dow was or how big DuPont was, he was going to build his own company.""Clifford did not receive his bachelor's degree until 1947, because he and other students were co-opted to work on war-time projects at the university.  It was difficult to find jobs after graduation.  Eventually, Clifford was hired part-time by a filtration company in Ames, Iowa to analyze water.  Seeing how the water-treatment plant worked gave Clifford the idea for a process and a product: a simplified method of analysis that would enable workers to treat water with powdered formulas rather than heavy chemical solutions.He raised startup money by selling the rights to another invention. The Walter Kidde fire extinguisher company had approached the University of Iowa for ideas for generating carbon dioxide to fight fires.  Clifford came up with a patentable idea, and sold it to the fire company for $15,000. With the money the Hachs co-founded Hach Chemical Company in 1947. They bought an acre of land in Ames, Iowa, and built a cement block building which became their plant. They lived with their three children in a small apartment at the plant.Clifford Hach was in charge of research and development while Kitty handled management and marketing. Their first successful product was a simplified titration method for measuring hardness in drinking water, which they packaged in easy-to-use testing kits. As municipal standards for drinking water were developed, Kitty recognized both the importance of water plant operators as a market, and the need to work closely with them to develop standards and provide long-term customer service. She developed a direct mail marketing campaign, and earned the nickname ""Kitty"" Hach by flying her plane across the United States, sometimes landing on rural dirt airstrips in bad weather, delivering water quality testing kits to municipalities of all sizes. She became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organization of licensed women pilots, and accumulated over 7,000 hours flying time. She was rated for multi-engine and instrument flying.Kathryn Hach became the first woman director of the American Water Works Association, an international non-profit, scientific and educational association founded to improve water quality and supply throughout the world. She later served on numerous AWWA committees, including the President's Advisory Council.


== Hach Chemical Company ==
Hach Chemical was instrumental in standardizing water-purification tests and pioneered many world-standard analytical instruments. Their tests were designed to be simple and effective, with nontechnical directions that made their products easy for both chemists and non-chemists to use. As of 2012, about 70 percent of municipalities in the United States used Hach Company instrumentation, allowing them to detect impurities in water at the parts-per-billion level.Hach Chemical Company was incorporated in 1951, went public in 1968. The company moved its headquarters to Loveland, Colorado, in 1978,   and was renamed Hach Company in 1980. Under Kitty Hach's management, the company developed an employee base of over 900 people and became one of the top women owned businesses in the United States. Kathryn Hach-Darrow was president, chief operating officer, and CEO of the Hach company.After Clifford's death in 1990, Kitty was named Hach Co.'s chairman and CEO and her son Bruce assumed the role of president. In 1995, she married Donald Darrow, a retired airline pilot, becoming Kitty Hach-Darrow. In 1999, Kitty and her son Bruce sold the Hach company to Danaher Corporation.


== Awards and honors ==
In 1957, Kathryn and Clifford Hach jointly won the American Water Works George Warren Fuller Award for distinguished service in the water supply field.
In 1987, the Hach Company was elected the Best Company in Colorado, receiving the award for the Northeastern part of the state.
In 1992, she was honored by Northwood University with an Outstanding Business Leaders Award.
In January 2000, she was voted a member of the Colorado Business Hall of Fame (sponsored by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce and Junior Achievement).
Kathryn ""Kitty"" Hach-Darrow received the second annual Pittcon Heritage Award in 2003.
In 2004, Kitty Hach-Darrow received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Colorado State University.


== Philanthropy ==
In 1982 the Hachs established the Hach Scientific Foundation to support chemistry in the classroom through grants to students and schools. In January 2009, the Hach Scientific Foundation transferred its assets to the American Chemical Society, which continues to administer the scholarship and grant programs.
In May 2000, Kathryn Hach-Darrow gave a $10 million gift to Northwood University. The Hach Student Life Center, a 62,212 square foot student center which includes classrooms, social areas, and sports facilities, opened in 2002.
Kitty Hach-Darrow and the Hach family were significant contributors to the building of Hach Hall, a new chemistry building dedicated at Iowa State University on October 8, 2010.
Through gifts in 2012 and 2014, Hach-Darrow established an endowment for the Kathryn C. Hach Award for Entrepreneurial Success through the American Chemical Society.  The award is to be given to someone who has ""created something where nothing existed before”.

47,"Christine Hallquist (born April 11, 1956) is an American politician and former CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC). She is the first openly transgender major-party nominee for governor in the United States, winning the 2018 Democratic nomination for Governor of Vermont with over 40% of the vote. Hallquist worked at VEC from 1998 to 2018, the last 13 years as CEO, until she resigned to run for governor. Drawing national attention as a pioneering example of a CEO transitioning while in office, her transition was documented by her son in a documentary, Denial.


== Early life and education ==
Hallquist grew up in Baldwinsville, New York as one of seven children and later attended Catholic elementary school. She had a difficult time in school and in the 8th grade, a school official called her parents to say that she needed an exorcism.  Her parents immediately disagreed with school officials and pulled her out of the school. She attended public high school and later the Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica, New York.  At the age of 20, Hallquist moved to Vermont. She started as an engineer at IBM and then enrolled in a training program at the University of Massachusetts to become an electrical engineer.


== Career ==
After beginning her professional life at IBM, Hallquist took a job at Digital Equipment Corporation. There she joined a training program at the University of Massachusetts to become an electrical engineer and worked with Digital to create low-cost power supplies quickly using lean manufacturing. Hallquist accepted an early buyout from Digital and moved back to Vermont to become the CEO of a small electronics company in Barre, Vermont, then founded a consulting firm that worked with such companies as Xerox, Miller Beer, and Honda. She started at VEC as engineering and operations manager in 2000, shortly after its recovery from bankruptcy.In July 2021 Governor Phil Scott appointed her as executive director of the newly-established Vermont Community Broadband Board (VCBB).


== Gubernatorial campaign ==

Hallquist announced her 2018 gubernatorial campaign in Morrisville, Vermont on April 8, and said, ""I truly believe Vermont is ready to elect a transgender governor because I don't think Vermonters are going to look at that."" Hallquist ran on a platform of increased broadband access, universal Medicare and aggressive action against climate change.In an August 22, 2018 interview with the Associated Press, Hallquist reported she had been getting death threats and personal attacks from all over the United States and around the world. The threats caused Hallquist to alter campaign appearances and decide not to publicize the address of her Morrisville campaign headquarters. On September 17, 2018, Politico rated the race as ""Lean Republican"", one step away from a tossup. On November 6, 2018, Hallquist lost the election to Republican candidate and incumbent Phil Scott.


== Personal life ==
Hallquist lives in Hyde Park, Vermont, with her wife, Pat. They have three adult children and two grandchildren. She confided to her wife that she was transgender early in their marriage and opened up to her children in the 2000s. She publicly transitioned in 2015. Although her mother accepted the transition, Hallquist's relationship with some of her friends and siblings deteriorated. Hallquist later commented that the transition was much easier than expected and that her relationship with her wife and children remains strong.In April 2020, Hallquist tested positive for COVID-19.

51,"Ellen Mooney Hancock (April 15, 1943 – April 19, 2022) was a technology manager from the United States who worked for IBM and Apple, among others.


== Early life and education ==
Hancock was born April 15, 1943, in the Bronx, New York City, and raised in New York's Westchester County. She graduated from the College of New Rochelle and earned a master's degree in mathematics from Fordham University.


== Career ==


=== IBM ===
Hancock spent 29 years at IBM, where she rose to senior vice president in charge of network hardware and software. She ran the networking hardware division through the first half of the 1990s, at a time when it saw double-digit losses in market share year after year. (The division was ultimately sold to Cisco in 1999.) She was also a member of the IBM Corporate Executive Committee and the IBM Worldwide Management Council.


=== National Semiconductor ===
In September 1995, she was hired away from IBM by Gil Amelio to become National Semiconductor's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). She worked closely with Amelio to move National Semiconductor to profitability. During that time, Hancock worked with National's CompactRISC architecture, which was a forerunner to the successful ARM7 architecture. Not long after that, Gil Amelio left National Semiconductor to become CEO at Apple Computer, and in July 1996 Gil Amelio hired Hancock to join him there.


=== Apple ===
Ellen Hancock was employed at Apple Computer, Inc. under the leadership of Gil Amelio.At Apple, Hancock took over the Chief Technology Officer role in the midst of the floundering next-generation operating system (OS) project named Copland. She was largely responsible for the decision to cancel Copland. To replace it, Hancock had favored Sun Microsystems's Solaris operating system over NeXT Inc.'s NeXTSTEP, and was against the eventual purchase of NeXT. Even after the deal was done, she wanted to use at least the kernel of Solaris. With NeXT came Steve Jobs, who publicly lampooned her on several occasions calling her a ""bozo"". When the Apple board of directors fired Gil Amelio, Jobs reorganized the company leaving her with a much reduced role in charge of quality assurance as former NeXT executives took over many positions in Apple. She soon resigned.


=== Exodus Communications ===
After Apple she took a CEO position with Exodus Communications in March 1998 and became chairman of the board in 2000. Exodus set a Nasdaq record of 19 consecutive quarters of 40 percent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. In 2000, the $29 billion market cap exceeded even that of her former employer, Apple Computer. However, in 2001 the company became part of the dot-com crash, the stock plummeted and Hancock stepped down as CEO in September 2001. The company filed for bankruptcy that same month, followed by an asset purchase by Cable & Wireless in February 2002. Savvis Communications purchased the related assets from C&W in November 2004.


=== Acquicor ===
Hancock served as President, COO, and secretary to the board of Acquicor, a company she co-founded with former Apple-CEO Gil Amelio and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.  The company was a 'blank check' holding company, or ""SPAC"". Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor in February 2007 and Hancock resigned on June 7, 2007.


== Memberships ==
Hancock was a member on the boards of several companies and academic and nonprofit institutions, including Aetna, Colgate-Palmolive, Electronic Data Systems, Ripcord Networks, Marist College, Santa Clara University, and the Pacific Council on International Policy.

53,"Ruth Marianna Handler (née Mosko; November 4, 1916 – April 27, 2002) was an American businesswoman and inventor. She is best known for inventing the Barbie doll in 1959, and being co-founder of toy manufacturer Mattel with her husband Elliot, as well as serving as the company's first president from 1945 to 1975.The Handlers were forced to resign from Mattel in 1975 after the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company for falsifying financial documents.Handler was prominently characterized in the 2023 film Barbie.


== Early life ==
Ruth Marianna Mosko was born on November 4, 1916 in Denver, Colorado, to Polish-Jewish immigrants Jacob Moskowicz, a blacksmith, and Ida Moskowicz, née Rubenstein. Ruth was the youngest of ten children. When Ruth was six months old, her parents sent her to live with her older sister Sarah. Ruth stayed with Sarah until the age of nineteen  and developed an enthusiasm for business by working at Sarah’s drugstore/soda fountain.In 1932, Ruth fell in love with Izzy Handler, an art student. The summer of her sophomore year at University of Denver, Ruth went to Los Angeles and landed a job at Paramount Studio. Ruth and Izzy married in 1938 in Denver. Returning to California, Ruth encouraged her husband to drop the stereotypical ""Izzy"" to go by his middle name, Elliot. After marriage, Ruth returned to work at Paramount while Elliot was employed as a lighting fixture designer.


== Formation of Mattel ==
Elliot tried his hand at a hobby of furniture making. He decided to make furniture from two new types of plastics, Lucite and Plexiglas. Ruth suggested that he start doing this commercially and they began a furniture business. Ruth worked as the sales force for the new business, landing contracts with Douglas Aircraft Company and others.


=== Origin ===
Ruth and Elliot founded a furniture company with Harold ""Matt"" Matson, naming it Mattel by combining the surname Matson with the first name Elliot; Elliot later said the founders could not fit Ruth into the name of the company. When sales fell during World War II, Mattel began to make toy furniture. The success of this business caused Ruth and Elliott to move Mattel fully into toy manufacturing.


=== Barbie ===
Observing her daughter Barbara and friends have fun with paper dolls and role-play adult scenarios, Ruth Handler noticed a market void. Dolls available at that time featured mainly babies or toddlers, but nothing really adult.
During a trip to Europe in 1956 with Barbara and son Kenneth, Ruth came across Bild Lilli, a German toy doll. In an interview with Mary G. Lord, the author of Forever Barbie, Handler said that she saw the doll in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, the book points out that on other occasions Handler said that she saw the doll in Zürich or Vienna. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Ruth had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a satirical comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. The Lilli doll was first sold in 1955 in Germany, and although initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing it up in outfits that were available separately.Upon return to the United States, Ruth Handler redesigned the doll with help from local inventor-designer Jack Ryan. Handler named her doll Barbie (full name Barbie Millicent Roberts) after her daughter Barbara, and said Barbie was from Willows, Wisconsin. Premiering on March 9, 1959, at the American International Toy Fair in New York City, the first Barbie doll cost $3 and was an instant hit. In its first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold.Later, the Handlers and Mattel added a boyfriend for Barbie named Ken after the Handlers' son. That was followed by the release of a huge range of new Barbie dolls, with more than 125 careers. Barbie wasn't just a representation; she was known for her versatility and fashion. Expanding the line after its initial success, Ruth Handler added cars, sports gear, clothes, and doll furniture to Barbie's collection.


== Later years ==
Handler was diagnosed in 1970 with breast cancer. She had a modified radical mastectomy, which was often used at the time to combat the disease. She spent less time at Mattel to focus on improving her health. Her loss of self-esteem affected her leadership and she lost control of her own business. In an interview in 1980, she explained to a reporter, “When I conceived Barbie, I believed it was important to a little girl’s self-esteem to play with a doll that has breasts. Now I find it even more important to return that self-esteem to women who have lost theirs.”Due to difficulties in finding a good breast prosthesis, Handler decided to make her own. With the help of new business partner Peyton Massey, and under her new company Ruthton Corp., Handler manufactured a more realistic version of a woman's breast called ""Nearly Me"",  aiming to boost confidence for women regardless of their health condition. This invention became quite popular, and then-first lady Betty Ford was fitted for one after having a mastectomy.Ruth Handler received various awards for her philanthropy and business activities. She earned titles such as Woman of the Year in Business (Los Angeles Times), entry into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame (Toy Manufacturers of America), the Volunteer Achievement Award (American Cancer Society), and was the inaugural ""Woman of Distinction"" recognized by the United Jewish Appeal.Following several investigations of producing fraudulent financial reports, Handler resigned from Mattel in 1975. Investigations continued after her resignation, and, in 1978, Handler was charged with fraud and false reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest, and was fined $57,000 (equivalent to $260,000 in 2022) and sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service. She blamed her illness for making her ""unfocused"" on her business.
Handler died on April 27, 2002, in California from complications during surgery for colon cancer. She was age 85. Her husband Elliot died nine years later at the age of 95.


== In popular culture ==
Handler is portrayed in the 2023 film Barbie by actress Rhea Perlman. As depicted, the ghost of an elderly Handler resides in an office on the 17th floor of Mattel headquarters in Los Angeles. There she meets the movie's stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie). Later, while advising Barbie, Handler tells her about her creation and how it related to her daughter, Barbara. Barbie then takes the name ""Barbara Handler"" as her own.
The film stirred a wave of media coverage of Handler.

== Overview ==
Harel researches and writes on the impact of computational new media technology on the social and academic development of children and their epistemology. Her MIT Media Lab research with Seymour Papert has contributed to the development of constructionist learning theory. She blogs monthly on Huffington Post Impact and Technology verticals on computer skills education, particularly for young women, girls, and underprivileged children, and the value of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in education reform.Harel was the founder and CEO of MaMaMedia Inc., the executive director of the MaMaMedia Consulting Group (MCG), and the founder, President, and Chair of the World Wide Workshop, educational technology development companies. She is presently the CEO and a founding Chair of Globaloria, which designs computer learning programs for K-12 schools in the United States.


== Personal life ==
Idit Ron was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. Her parents and their families are Holocaust survivors from Poland and Czechoslovakia. She married her first husband, David Harel, in 1979 (divorced 1995); they have three children. She married her second husband, former West Virginia governor Gaston Caperton, in 2003; they divorced in 2012.


== Career ==


=== Education ===
Harel moved to the United States in 1982 for graduate study at the Harvard Graduate School of Education after having previously received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Philosophy from Tel-Aviv University. She earned two graduate degrees from Harvard: an EdM in Technology in Education (1984) and a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAS) in Human Development (1985) from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In 1988, she earned a Ph.D in Epistemology and Learning Research from MIT after helping to formulate a new constructivist model with Seymour Papert, the ""Instructional Software Design Learning Paradigm.""


=== Children Designers ===
Harel's research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s led to the 1991 publication of Children Designers, which won the 1991 Outstanding Book Award from the American Education Research Association, with an introduction by Harel's research collaborator, constructivist researcher Seymour Papert. Children Designers presents the results of Harel's research in which she introduced disadvantaged fourth-grade children from the Boston area to the Logo programming language, and facilitated their creation of mathematical software applications that would help third-grade peers learn fractions. Children Designers suggested implementations within schools that emphasize this project-based and student-centered approach.


=== MaMaMedia ===

In 1995, Harel moved to New York City, where she founded MaMaMedia, an Internet dot-com that offered web services focused on inculcating digital literacy and creative learning skills among children and their parents who used the web games and activities offered. Harel developed MaMaMedia based largely on her research in the MIT Media Lab in the educational principles of constructionism. The site provided web users with a range of ""playful learning"" activities and projects, publishing the first print magazine for children about the Internet, MaMaMedia: A Kid's Guide to the Net.


=== World Wide Workshop and Globaloria ===

Harel founded World Wide Workshop in 2004, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that develops applications for learning with technology that combine game design and online social media experiences for youth to empower them to be inventors and leaders in the global knowledge economy. The foundation's programs aim to transform education by connecting youth to technology learning opportunities in schools and community centers, facilitating children's localized community engagement, and fostering the potential for economic development through game production experiences.Globaloria is a social learning system and educational program of the World Wide Workshop, in which participating students engage in a range of digital activities. The program was established in 2006 to cultivate both students' and educators' 21st century skills and digital literacy, facilitating mastery of social media technology tools, and students' deeper understanding of curricular areas, such as science, mathematics and health.


== Research and theories ==


=== Clickerati ===
Much of Harel's published work in the 1990s and early 2000s focused on the emergence of what she has termed the ""Clickerati Generation"" - children born since 1991 who will grow up immersed in new media, and unable to imagine a world without Internet technology. She calls for a radical paradigm shift in the education and acculturation of this generation, emphasizing normalization of digital information and communication, and the cultivation of digital literacy skills for their successful development, citizenship, and leadership within such physical-digital blended environments.


=== Constructionist MOOCs ===
Through the launch of the World Wide Workshop and research on its flagship program Globaloria, Harel has advanced the use of constructionist learning within the MOOC model. She has criticized MOOCs for generally replicating the instructor-led learning model, and asserts that Globaloria's educational tools are the only constructionist MOOCs for middle and high school students. She also states that this approach is unique in simultaneously training teachers and instructors on a blended learning model.

59,"Anne Julie  d'Harnoncourt (September 7, 1943 – June 1, 2008) was an American curator, museum director, and art historian specializing in modern art. She was the director and CEO of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA), a post she held from 1982 until her sudden death in 2008. She was also an expert scholar on the works of French artist Marcel Duchamp.


== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
d'Harnoncourt was born on September 7, 1943, in Washington, D.C. d'Harnoncourt grew up in New York City as the only child of René d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Museum of Modern Art from 1949 to 1967, who was of Austrian, Czech and French descent and Sarah (née Carr), a fashion designer. She was a cousin of the conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt. From 1949 to 1961 she attended The Brearley School in New York City. She continued her studies at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she majored in History and Literature of Europe and England since 1740, with additional course work in the history of architecture. Her BA thesis compared the poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Friedrich Hölderlin. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1965.


=== Beginning career ===
D'Harnoncourt's first museum experience was at the Tate Gallery, London where she worked for six months as part of an MA degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, preparing full catalog entries on thirty Pre-Raphaelite paintings and drawings in the collection in 1966–67.  She graduated from there in 1967 with a Master of Arts degree in nineteenth-century painting. She then came to the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) as a curatorial assistant in the Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1967 through 1969. During this time she helped oversee the installation of one of Marcel Duchamp's greatest and last major art installations, Étant donnés (1968) along with the coordination of Duchamp's wife Alexina Duchamp and his step-son Paul Matisse. In 1969, she was hired as assistant curator of twentieth-century art by the Art Institute of Chicago, a position she held until 1971. In that year, she also married Joseph J. Rishel, who was also an Assistant Curator at the Art Institute of Chicago at the time.


=== Curatorship at the Philadelphia Museum ===
In 1972, d'Harnoncourt returned to the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a curator of twentieth century art. She served in the position from 1972 and 1982. A specialist in the art of Marcel Duchamp, in 1973, she co-organized a major retrospective exhibition of his work, which originated in Philadelphia and traveled to the Museum of Modern Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. Other exhibitions organized or co-organized by Anne included Futurism and the International Avant-Garde (1980), Violet Oakley (1979), Eight Artists (1978) and John Cage: Scores & Prints (1982).
During her tenure as curator, she reinstalled the permanent galleries in the wing of the PMA devoted to 20th-century art, creating rooms specifically dedicated to the work of Duchamp and the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși.  Under her curatorship, the PMA made the commitment to substantially build their contemporary collection, acquiring important works by Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Elizabeth Murray, Claes Oldenburg, Katherine Anne Porter, Dorothea Rockburne, James Rosenquist, and Frank Stella among others.


=== Directorship of the Philadelphia Museum ===
In 1982, d'Harnoncourt, at the age of 38, was appointed the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, replacing Jean Sutherland Boggs. In 1997, she added the duties of the chief executive officer (CEO) to her role and served as both director and CEO. As Director, she fostered the growth and distinction of the PMA professional staff and encouraged a sequence of major exhibitions and publications by PMA curators and scholars. Among these were retrospectives of Brâncuși (1995), Cézanne (1996), Hon'ami Koetsu (2000), Barnett Newman (2002), and Salvador Dalí (2005); and surveys on topics ranging from Pennsylvania Germans: A Celebration of Their Arts (1983) to Japanese Design (1994), The Splendor of Eighteenth-Century Rome (2000) to Tesoros: The Arts in Latin America 1492–1820 (2006).Each exhibition was accompanied by an illustrated book-length catalog, while other PMA publications under her leadership have included British Paintings in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1986), Handbook of the Collections (1995), Gifts in Honor of the Museum's 125th Anniversary (2002), and Italian Paintings 1250–1450 (2004).
Between 1992 and 1995, in a massive building project undertaken to reinstall all of the PMA European collections, over 90 galleries were renovated and relit, while thousands of works of art were examined, conserved and placed in fresh contexts. Twenty galleries for modern and contemporary art were renovated and reopened in the fall of 2000.
As part of the long range plan, and in celebration of the PMA 125th anniversary year, a capital campaign with a goal of $200 million was formally launched in December 2000. Over $246 million was raised by the end of the campaign in 2004. In the same year, the PMA broke ground on repurposing of a landmark building across the street and embarked on a comprehensive master plan for its use and the additional steps necessary to meet its 25-year requirements for new or renovated space. The renovated structure, now named the Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman Building, opened in September 2007. It houses greatly expanded, state-of-the-art facilities for the PMA collections of prints, drawings, and photographs, costumes and textiles, modern and contemporary design, and Library and Archives.


=== The Gross Clinic ===
In 2006, d'Harnoncourt led a successful campaign to keep Thomas Eakins's masterpiece, The Gross Clinic, in Philadelphia by capital fundraising.  Gathering more than 3600 donors from all fifty states and collaborating with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, politicians and philanthropists, together they raised $68 million to ensure that the painting would not move out of state.


=== Death ===
D'Harnoncourt died unexpectedly on 1 June 2008, in Philadelphia, from cardiac arrest. She was survived by her longtime husband, Joseph J.

64,"Frances Kazuko Hashimoto (August 26, 1943 – November 4, 2012) was an American businesswoman, schoolteacher, and social activist. She was a key figure and proponent of Los Angeles' Little Tokyo neighborhood. She was the head of Mikawaya confectionery company  since 1970, where Hashimoto, the inventor of mochi ice cream, also introduced the dessert to American consumers.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Hashimoto's parents, Koroku and Haru Hashimoto, owned the family-owned Mikawaya wagashi, a traditional Japanese confectionery which opened in 1910 in Los Angeles. They were forced to shutter their business with the outbreak of World War II. Koroku and Haru were interned with thousands of other Japanese Americans during World War II due to Executive Order 9066. They were sent to the Poston War Relocation Center in Poston, Arizona. Frances Hashimoto was born in the Poston War Relocation Center on August 26, 1943. The family returned to Los Angeles after the war and their release from internment. Hashimoto's parents reopened Mikawaya at 244 E. First Street in the city's Little Tokyo on December 23, 1945.Hashimoto was raised in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. She attended Hollenbeck Junior High School, where her classmates included Ellen Endo, the former editor of Rafu Shimpo, and Theodore Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights. Hashimoto received a bachelor's degree from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1966 and became an elementary school teacher.


=== Mikawaya ===
She taught third grade for four years until her mother, who had been widowed, asked her to join the family business full-time in 1970. Hashimoto mulled over her decision for six months before ultimately deciding to leave teaching. She became the chief executive officer of Mikawaya in 1970, when she was twenty-seven years old.Though she faced some instances of gender bias, Hashimoto quickly sought to expand the family's business from one location in Little Tokyo to a multi-store enterprise. In 1974, she opened a second bakery location on Fourth Street in Los Angeles. Under Hashimoto, who served as CEO and president, Mikawaya expanded to include additional locations in Little Tokyo, Torrance, California, Gardena, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii. The company's flagship store is located at the Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo.Frances Hashimoto is credited as creator of the popular mochi ice cream. She also spearheaded the line's introduction to the American market. Hashimoto's husband, Joel Friedman, initially conceived the idea of wrapping small orbs of ice cream with a coating of mochi, a sweet Japanese rice cake, during the early 1990s. Hashimoto expanded on the idea, offering seven flavors of mochi ice cream made by Mikawaya. The mochi ice cream line proved a hit with consumers, expanding Mikawaya from more traditional Japanese pastries like chestnut buns or rice cakes. Mikawaya now sells its mochi ice cream in Whole Foods, Albertsons, Trader Joe's, Ralphs, and Safeway. Mochi ice cream now accounts for the majority of Mikawaya's sales.


=== Community activism ===
Hashimoto worked for the preservation of Little Tokyo, with challenges ranging from changing demographics and economic downturns.In 1982, Hashimoto became the first woman to chair the Nisei Week Japanese Festival. She organized fundraising for Nisei Week and remained a strong proponent of the festival in the face of declining attendance in recent years, arguing that younger Japanese Americans needed to remain aware of their cultural heritage. She arranged for the festival's annually crowned Nisei Week queen and princesses to attend an exchange in Nagoya, a sister city of Los Angeles. Hashimoto also pushed for stronger ties between Little Tokyo and Minami Otsu Dori Shotengai, a section of Nagoya.Hashimoto served as the President of Little Tokyo Business Association (LTBA) from 1994 to 2008. She actively sought to preserve the character of Little Tokyo and oversaw the redevelopment of the neighborhood, including signage, housing, and security. Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry later noted that, ""She worked very hard to protect the history, integrity and identity of Little Tokyo as the largest Japantown in California."" She was also a member of the boards of several Japanese American organizations, including the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center (JACCC) and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of Southern California. Hashimoto also served as the vice president of the Little Tokyo Community Council.


== Awards ==
In the spring of 2012, the government of Japan awarded Hashimoto the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays, for her contributions to Japan–United States relations.On September 19, 2012, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted to rename the intersection of Azusa and Second Streets ""Frances Hashimoto Plaza"" in recognition of her cultural contributions to the city. The motion was jointly sponsored by city council members José Huizar, who represents Boyle Heights, and Jan Perry, who represents Downtown Los Angeles, including Little Tokyo. The new name for the plaza was formally unveiled at a ceremony held on November 15, 2012.The Nisei Week Foundation's annually awarded community service award is now named in her honor.


== Death ==
Hashimoto died at her home in Pasadena, California, from lung cancer on Sunday, November 4, 2012, at the age of 69. She was survived by her husband, Joel Friedman, their sons, Bryan Koji and Ryan Koroku Hashimoto-Friedman, and her sister, Sachiko June Osugi.

75,"Elfrieda ""Freddy"" Hiebert (born 1948) is an educational researcher whose work examines literacy, learning, early childhood development, teacher development, writing and children's literature. The main thrust of her work addresses literacy learning among at-risk youth in American classrooms. Currently, she is the CEO and president of TextProject, Inc., an agency that is dedicated to bringing beginning and struggling readers to high levels of literacy through a variety of strategies and tools, particularly through using science and social studies texts, used for reading instruction.


== Biography ==
Elfrieda ""Freddy"" H. Hiebert received her B.A.. in history from Fresno Pacific College, her M.Ed. in Elementary Education from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, and her Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. She started her career as a classroom teacher for the Clovis (CA) Unified School District before entering graduate school. From 1979 to 1985, she was on the faculty of the University of Kentucky. During her tenure at the University of Kentucky, she spent a year as a visiting associate professor at the Center for the Study of Reading at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1984) where she served as the director of staff for Becoming a Nation of Readers:  The Report of the Commission on Reading which, in 1985, was published under the auspices of the Center for the Study of Reading and the National Academy of Education.  In 1987, she assumed a professorship at the University of Colorado Boulder and, in 1994, moved to the University of Michigan. From 1997 to 1999, she directed the Center for Improvement of Early Reading Achievement (CIERA) at the University of Michigan that  included researchers Susan B. Neuman and Nell K. Duke as well as others from Michigan State University, University of Virginia, University of Southern California, and the University of Minnesota. From 2005 to 2010, she was an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  In January 2011, she founded and became CEO/president of TextProject, Inc.
Among the awards that Hiebert has received in recognition of her contributions as a researcher and educator are the School of Education Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2000), William S. Gray Citation of Merit award for outstanding contributions to the field of reading from the International Reading Association (2008), election to the Reading Hall of Fame (2008), and selection as a Fellow of the American Educational Research Association (2011).


== Research and contributions to educational practice ==
Hiebert has authored or edited 11 books, including the influential report, Becoming a Nation of Readers, and published over 150 articles in archival journals or chapters in academic volumes.  The primary focus of her work has been on identifying text features that support reading development among beginning and struggling readers.  She has also contributed to related literatures, particularly on how knowledge of vocabulary influences students' learning from text.  Hiebert has recently addressed the issues of how words should be selected for explicit instruction in reading and how word selection differs for narrative compared to informational texts.
A strand of Hiebert's recent work explores students' facility in applying word recognition skills while reading texts silently.  As a result, Hiebert has suggested that ""comprehension-based silent reading rate""  (or CBSRR) is a critical concept requiring attention from both researchers and instructors.


== Research on text complexity and the TExT model ==
The main focus of Hiebert's research is identifying appropriate texts for struggling and beginning readers. Beginning with Becoming a Nation of Readers, Hiebert has been a proponent of alternative models of text difficulty. She has advocated alternatives to conventional readability formulas as well as current updated versions such as lexiles. Hiebert has written extensively about the failure of typical procedures for establishing text difficulty to recognize how the decodability of a word can inflate a text's difficulty.  Similarly, she has noted that conventional readability formulas penalize texts that have sufficient repetition for readers to develop automaticity in word recognition and pronunciation.
As an alternative to current procedures for establishing text difficulty, Hiebert has proposed the Text Elements by Task (TExT) Model .  This model evaluates text difficulty by examining two text features that research has shown to have an influence on word recognition among beginning and struggling readers.  The features are: (a) the linguistic content of the words in the text (i.e., the letter-sound patterns within the words and the relative frequency of the words in written English), and (b) the cognitive load placed on the reader in processing the linguistic content.


== TextProject.org and TextProject, Inc ==
Hiebert has sustained a career-long commitment to furthering strong and evidence-based reading instruction.  In Becoming a Nation of Readers, Hiebert and her coauthors (Richard C. Anderson, Judith A. Scott and Ian A.G. Wilkerson) found a wide audience and had a substantial effect on national policy and practice.  As director of CIERA, she was responsible for Every child a reader, a summary of research on effective beginning reading practices. TextProject, Inc.supports struggling and beginning readers by providing (a) books and book lists that are indexed by reading level, (b) lessons for teachers and tutors to use with their students, and (c) analytical reports for teacher educators, school board members, and other decision-makers on the research underlying reading programs and policies.

76,"Raelynn J. Hillhouse is an American national security and Intelligence community analyst, former smuggler during the Cold War, spy novelist and health care executive.


== Personal history ==
Hillhouse taught at the University of Michigan and was an assistant professor of political science at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. She is a founding member of the International Thriller Writers.
Hillhouse is also a health care executive who has developed behavioral health programs for children with autism. She was CEO and President of Hawaii Behavioral Health. She also founded Thrive Autism Solutions, one of the largest providers of autism behavioral health services in the Midwest.Hillhouse studied in Central and Eastern Europe for over six years at various institutions including Moscow State University, Moscow Finance Institute, Humboldt University of Berlin, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen (both in Germany), and Babes-Bolyai University (Cluj, Romania). She earned her undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis and her MA in Russian and East European Studies as well as her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan.
When living as a student in Europe, she claims to have engaged in the black market between East and West, running Cuban rum, smuggling jewels from the Soviet Union and laundering East Bloc currencies. She claims to have been recruited by the East German secret police, the Stasi, and by the Libyan Intelligence Service. Some sources assert that she was an American intelligence officer, but Hillhouse denies this.Hillhouse was born in the Ozarks and currently lives in Hawaii.


== Blog ==
Hillhouse writes a national security blog which has broken multiple national security stories. Her work has been extensively cited in global media, books and academic journals and law reviews.In 2007, the New York Times Week in Review republished excerpts from an exclusive interview from Hillhouse's blog with the head of the private military corporation Blackwater USA.In June 2007, Hillhouse discovered the US national Intelligence Community budget metadata in a declassified PowerPoint presentation released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She broke international news stories on national security risks caused by the explosion in outsourcing governmental intelligence functions. Her controversial articles have twice elicited a response from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence—the only times the office of the nation's chief spy has ever publicly responded to the writings of a private citizen.


== Death of Bin Laden Report ==
On August 7, 2011, Hillhouse published an account of Osama bin Laden's death on her blog that suggested Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had been sheltering bin Laden in return for Saudi cash and that he was betrayed by a Pakistani intelligence officer.Hillhouse's sources claimed that the narrative given by the White House of the courier revealing the location of bin Laden was a cover story, created to hide involvement of US allies in sheltering bin Laden. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid. Her 2011 story received widespread international attention and was picked up by The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, The National Post, The Vancouver Sun, The Sydney Morning Herald, The New Zealand Herald, and others, but had little coverage in the US.


== Controversy over report of bin Laden's death ==

In May 2015, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report in the London Review of Books in which he claimed to break the story of bin Laden's death. His claims mirrored the ones which Hillhouse raised four years earlier.The New York Times, The Washington Post and other global media acknowledged that Hillhouse wrote about the events years before Hersh, although Hersh denied ever having seen her account.NBC News independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report, and not the courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse both reported that their sources indicated that a walk-in was a highly valuable asset in the discovery of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family.


== Publications ==


=== Articles ===
She has also published stories on national security in the Washington Post and The Nation. In the controversial Washington Post article, Hillhouse wrote that ""the private spy industry has succeeded where no foreign government has: It has penetrated the CIA and is running the show."" In the Nation article, Hillhouse revealed that private companies are heavily involved in the nation’s most important and most sensitive national security document — the President’s Daily Brief. Hillhouse was also a regular contributor to Wired's national security blog, ""The Danger Room"".

77,"Jacqueline Anne ""Jacque"" Hinman P.E. LEED (her maiden name is Crenca and used earlier Rast as her surname which was from a previous marriage) is one of a small number of women who have led Fortune 500 companies. She was most recently the chairman, president and CEO of CH2M HILL, a Fortune 500 US engineering company.  In the first quarter of 2024, she will take over as the CEO of Atlas Technical Consultants, based out of Austin, Texas.


== Early life and education ==
Hinman received her bachelor's degree in civil/environmental engineering from Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering in 1983. She also attended the Stanford Executive Program in 2013.  She is a registered professional engineer (P.E.) with accreditation under the US Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.


== Career ==


=== Pre-CEO Career ===
In 1988, Hinman joined CH2M HILL in the environmental business. She worked for ten years doing design management, project management, construction management, business development, and operations management. In 1997 she became the CEO of management consulting firm Talisman Partners, which was acquired by the Infrastructure Division of Tyco in 2001.  From 2001 until 2004 Hinman was senior vice president of Tyco's Facilities and Infrastructure Business (formerly Earth Tech).  She owned the Azimuth Group from 2004 to 2005, serving as a senior management consultant for the construction and engineering industry.After returning to CH2M HILL, Hinman was appointed to the board of CH2M HILL Companies, Ltd on May 6, 2008. She served in multiple Executive Roles for the company, including serving as President of the Facilities and Infrastructure Division, President of the Center for Project Excellence, and Senior VP of Global Business Development. Hinman was especially instrumental in developing the firm's sport program management business, capitalizing on its historic involvement in the sustainability aspects of the Olympics (Atlanta, Sydney, Salt Lake City, Vancouver) and expanding the company's work into infrastructure and overall sport program management for the London and Rio Olympics. She also worked with global teams to win major programs such as the Panama Canal Expansion and the MASDAR UAE Sustainable City.  Beginning in 2011 Hinman served as President of the International Division of CH2M HILL, and oversaw the acquisition of UK-based Halcrow Group, for which she served as Chairman and CEO until its integration.


=== CEO of CH2M HILL ===
Hinman took over as President and CEO in January, 2014. In July 2014 the company announced the appointment of Hinman to be the chairman of the board replacing Lee McIntire who had retired from that position on September 18, 2014.According to The Denver Post-Business in October 2013, her position was noteworthy, as engineering had traditionally been a field in which men have dominated.  According to Mark Leftly of the UK's The Independent in September 2013, since her rise to the head of CH2M Hill she is “one of the most powerful women in the industry.”Hinman promoted diversity and inclusion during her tenure as Chairman and CEO, achieving numerous goals not typical of the industry, including a high proportion of women in junior and senior management positions, and the 2020 Women on Boards recognition for board composition of 30% women. Hinman has been a noted reference on improving corporate cultures and diversity.Under Hinman's leadership, CH2M HILL expanded upon its recognition for industry leadership, inclusive culture, and impact on the world.  The company was named by Fortune in 2017 as one of the ""Top 50 Companies Changing the World"" and as a Forbes ""Best Employer for Diversity"" and ""Best Large Employer"".  It was also named as a ""World's Most Ethical Company"" by Ethisphere for a ninth consecutive year.Hinman's tenure as CEO also saw the company shift away from fixed price Engineer-Procure-Construct (EPC) contracts.  Years earlier, the company had decided to enter the at-risk construction industry and taken on several EPC projects that proved difficult to perform and strained the balance sheet starting in late 2013. These challenges and the company's lagging growth in its core engineering and consulting business also prompted the CH2M HILL Board to evaluate the company's capital structure in 2014.  In 2015, CH2M HILL modified its historical employee ownership model by bringing on private equity firm Apollo Global Management in 2015 as a minority investor.  During the period 2015-2017, CH2M HILL improved its performance - including sales, project delivery, and profitability - through an increased focus on client and project management, and a shift in operating model. Facing a growing retired employee shareholder base, the CH2M HILL board actively evaluated capital structure change options in 2017 in order to provide sufficient capital to shareholders that desired to sell their stock.  After preparing for an IPO, and evaluating other merger and sales options, CH2M HILL agreed to merge with Jacobs Engineering in August 2017. Hinman retired from CH2M HILL concurrent with the completion of the December 2017 merger.


=== Board memberships ===
In November 2017, Hinman joined the board of International Paper, and has served on each of its committees.  She currently chairs the  Management Development and Compensation Committee. In April 2019, Hinman was named a Director of the newly formed Dow Inc., after having served on the board of DowDuPont since June 2018.  Hinman has served on each of Dow's board committees and currently chairs the Environmental, Health, Safety and Technology Committee and also serves on the Compensation and Governance committees.  In December 2019, Hinman joined the board of AECOM, serving on its Strategy, Risk and Safety Committee and its Compensation Committee.   She ended her AECOM board service on March 1, 2022.  Hinman also previously served on the board executive committee of the nonprofit organization Catalyst

79,"Irene Hirano Inouye (née Yasutake; October 7, 1948 – April 7, 2020) was the founding President of the U.S.-Japan Council, a position she held ever since she helped create the organization in 2009 until her death. Hirano Inouye focused on building positive relations between the United States and Japan, and was also a leader in philanthropy, community engagement, and advancing social causes. She served on a number of prominent non-profit boards, and was chair of the Ford Foundation's board of trustees. She previously served as president and founding chief executive officer of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles from 1988 to 2008, which is affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.


== Career ==


=== Early non-profit career ===
Hirano dedicated her professional life to non-profit work supporting a number of important communities.  She started her work in the field of public administration as the Executive Director of the T.H.E. Clinic, a non-profit community health facility for low and moderate income women and families. She worked at the clinic for thirteen years, during which time she discovered that there was a need for the public to understand the differences in the needs of people based on gender and cultural backgrounds.


=== Museum leadership and arts engagement ===
In 1988, Hirano became the director and president of the Japanese American National Museum. The Japanese American National Museum is the first museum in the United States dedicated to sharing the experience of Americans of Japanese ancestry as an integral part of U.S. history.  Since the opening of its historic site in 1992, the museum has continued to fulfill its mission through historical exhibitions, and through partnerships with other communities and museums.  It has been at the forefront of preserving, researching and educating about the internment experience during World War II, as well as related issues such as Japanese American military service in World War II, redress, and broader civil rights.  The National Museum opened its 85,000 square-foot Pavilion to the public in January 1999.In 1994, she was appointed by President Clinton to the Committee on the Arts and Humanities.


=== Strengthening U.S.-Japan relations ===
Hirano Inouye served as President of the U.S.-Japan Council, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo. The U.S.-Japan Council was established in 2009 as an organization dedicated to building people-to-people relationships between the two countries.Hirano Inouye created the Council with other Japanese American leaders to provide opportunities for Japanese Americans to reconnect to Japan.  She saw the importance of connecting Japanese American communities and younger Nikkei generations to the land of their ancestry as an important way to strengthen U.S.-Japan relations.  Having led U.S. delegations to Japan under the Japanese Government's Japanese American Leadership Delegation for several years, she recognized the untapped potential within the Japanese American community to actively support people-to-people connections that were the foundation of the bilateral relationship.  She saw that although many Japanese Americans had been addressing U.S.-Japan relations in their various professions, the time had come to create an organization of leaders who are dedicated to working on U.S.-Japan relations.  As such, she brought together leaders from all different fields who are either working in or committed to building that relationship. There are many Japanese Americans in very high positions in various sectors.  The Council's role is to connect them with each other, with their counterparts in Japan, and with other diverse leaders with the same mission and vision.The Council has grown in size and expanded its activities to include diverse participants, and signature programs such as the Japanese American Leadership Delegation, the Asian American Leadership Delegation, the Emerging Leaders Program, and well-attended Annual Conferences that gather government, business, and civil society leaders from both countries.Since 2011, the U.S.-Japan Council has administered the TOMODACHI Initiative in partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.  The initiative is a public-private partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, and enjoys the strong support of the Government of Japan and it invests in the next generation of leaders in U.S.-Japan relations. The Initiative represents a path-breaking paradigm in U.S. public diplomacy, in which government joins forces with private enterprises and organizations to achieve mutually beneficial, strategic goals. TOMODACHI provides young Japanese and Americans with opportunities to study, live, and work in each other's countries, thereby ensuring a thriving bilateral partnership into the foreseeable future.  TOMODACHI has raised over $45 million, supported over 35,000 participants in activities, with over 5,000 program alumni (as of late 2016).


=== Non-profit board leadership and service ===
Her professional and community activities included serving as the Immediate Past Chair of the Board of Directors to the Ford Foundation, where she continued as a Trustee. She was the immediate past Chair of The Kresge Foundation and served as a Trustee. She also was a member of the Boards of Trustees of the Independent Sector and The Washington Center.  She was an advisor to the Daniel K. Inouye Institute.Ms. Hirano Inouye's previous community service included Chair and Member of the Board of Directors of the American Association of Museums, Member of the Accreditation Commission American Association of Museums, Member, Board of Trustees, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Member, Board of Trustees, National Children's Museum, Presidential Appointee to the President's Committee on the Arts & Humanities, Smithsonian Institution National Board and Board of the National Museum of American History, Chair and Member of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau Board, Chair and Member California Commission on the Status of Women, and member of the Toyota Corporation Diversity Advisory Board and Sodexho Corporation Business Advisory Board.In 2016, the Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at USC launched a fund to support research and programs to explore foundation leadership as it solves society's most pressing problems, in honor of Irene Hirano Inouye.   In announcing the launch, she was recognized for her leadership.  ""Irene exemplifies what bold and thoughtful philanthropic leadership should look like,"" said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. ""She understands the dynamic interplay between board members and their executives, discovering how and when to take calculated risks. She also understands the important role organizational culture plays in a foundation's ability to deliver on its promises.""


=== Commitment to women's empowerment ===
The governor of California selected Hirano in 1976 to become the chair of the California Commission on the Status of Women. She worked throughout the state and found that often, ""Asian American women were invisible."" On the state commission, she worked with future BART director Carole Ward Allen and Hannah-Beth Jackson who would become a member of the California state legislature.
In 1980, she helped organize the Asian Women's Network in Los Angeles and served as its first president.  She has remained involved in a number of activities to promote women's empowerment within the Asian American community, as well as more broadly in both the United States and Japan.  In 2013 and 2014, she helped launch the Women in Business Summit in Tokyo, Japan (co-sponsored with the American Chamber of Commerce of Japan).  In 2014 and 2016, she represented the United States in Japan's international symposium, World Assembly for Women (WAW!).


=== Awards and recognition ===
Among the awards Hirano Inouye received for her work included ones from the Anti-Defamation League, the League of Women Voters, the National Education Association, the University of Southern California Alumni Association, the Liberty Hill Foundation, the Arab American National Museum, the Asian American Federation, the Asian Justice Center, and the Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics.Additional recognition included the 2012 Japan Foundation Award; Honorary Doctorate degree in 2015 from Southern Methodist University; and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry of New York's 2016 Eagle on the World Award.Additionally, in 2016, Forbes Japan included Hirano Inouye in its list of 55 Women Leaders of Japan.In August 2021, while visiting Japan for the Tokyo Olympics, First lady Jill Biden dedicated a room in the U.S. ambassador’s residence to Irene and her husband, the late U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye.  In October 2021, Hirano Inouye was posthumously awarded Japan's Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon.


== Personal life and death ==
Hirano was a sansei, which means she was a third-generation Japanese American, born on October 7, 1948, in Los Angeles.    Her grandparents on her father's side came from Fukuoka, and her mother was born in
Japan.  Hirano was one of only three women in the University of Southern California's (USC) Public Administration Program at the time; she received her Bachelor of Science in Public Administration in 1970.  Her sister, Patti Yasutake is an actor known for playing Nurse Ogawa on Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Hirano married United States Senator Daniel Inouye on May 24, 2008, in Beverly Hills, California. Hirano's daughter, Jessica, served as her Maid of Honor.  After being widowed in December 2012, Hirano Inouye was active in advancing many of her late husband's causes.
Hirano Inouye died in Los Angeles on April 7, 2020, at age 71, from leiomyosarcoma.

84,"Merle Hoffman (born March 6, 1946) is an American journalist and activist.
Shortly after New York State legalized abortion in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationally, Hoffman helped establish one of the country's first ambulatory abortion centers, Flushing Women's Medical Center in 1971. It was the forerunner of Choices Women's Medical Center which Hoffman founded and serves as president and CEO. Choices is a full-service healthcare provider, offering gynecological services, pre-natal care, family care, transgender health care, telemedicine, mental health and other services.
Hoffman co-founded the National Abortion Federation in 1976, the first professional organization of abortion providers in the U.S., and was its first president. She also founded the New York Pro-Choice Coalition in 1985. Hoffman is the publisher of On the Issues magazine, which began as a print publication in 1983 and then became an online publication in 2008. She was awarded the Front Page Award for Political Commentary in 2010 from the Newswoman's Club of New York.


== Early life ==
Hoffman was born in Philadelphia and raised in New York City. Initially intent on becoming a concert pianist, she attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City and graduated from Chatham Square Music School. After living and studying music in Paris, Hoffman returned to the United States and graduated from Queens College, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1972. She attended the Social Psychology Doctoral Program at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 1972 to 1975.


== Early influences ==
In her 2012 memoir, Intimate Wars: The Life and Times of the Woman Who Brought Abortion from the Back Alley to the Boardroom, Hoffman recounts how she was exposed to feminist activism at Queens College in the late '60s and early '70s. She attended a reading by the writer Anaïs Nin and later a lecture by Florynce Kennedy, ""who spoke about lesbianism and abortion, giving the class one of her famous lines: 'If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.'"" In her memoir, Hoffman recalls that her first exposure to abortion had been when she was about ten: ""I overheard my parents' discussion of a Philadelphia physician whose patient had died while he was performing an illegal procedure. To cover for himself, he cut her up in pieces and put her remains down the drain.""


== Career ==


=== Healthcare ""firsts"" and innovations ===
Hoffman co-founded and helped run Flushing Women's Medical Center (forerunner of Choices Women's Medical Center) in the borough of Queens in NYC in the spring of 1971, two years before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide. Hoffman considered many standard medical practices of the day sexist, invasive, and paternalistic. In response, she developed many of the patient-centered tenets and practices that have since become standards of female and feminist healthcare and implemented them at Flushing Women's. Hoffman's theory of ""Patient Power"" led to such now-standard practices as having another staff member in the room with the doctor and patient at all times and developing the concept of informed consent; having other women counselors rather than doctors provide emotional support and answer patients' questions during abortions; and using patients' abortion-based clinic visits as an opportunity to provide sexual health education as well as counseling on birth control options. Hoffman was also among the first to urge women to question their doctor about everything from their training and background to the reason for prescribing certain medications. Her work was noted by Francis X. Clines in The New York Times as ""making women feel powerful.""In November, 1974, Hoffman was the initiator and moderator for New York City's first Women's Health Forum, with speakers including Barbara Ehrenreich and Congresswoman Bella Abzug. In 1975, Hoffman helped develop and introduce a program to diagnosis women with breast cancer in an outpatient center. The program, known as STOP (Second Treatment Option Program), was pathbreaking; prior to its inception women were not consulted as to their diagnosis or treatment options. Previously, doctors had simply removed the breast of any woman whose biopsy came back positive while she was still anesthetized and before she had the opportunity to learn about her options or make decisions.When Hoffman learned about the lack of birth control options available to women in Russia, she organized and led a trip of physicians and counselors from Choices on a well-publicized educational exchange there. In 1974 she began working with Russian hospitals and doctors to develop CHOICES East, the first feminist outpatient medical center in Russia, and organized Russian feminists to deliver an open letter to Boris Yeltsin on the state of women's health care.


=== Writing, publishing and media ===
In 1982, Hoffman produced, directed, and wrote the documentary film Abortion: A Different Light, and in 1986 she produced and hosted the first feminist TV show, MH: On the Issues, a syndicated 30-minute cable TV show. Her first guest was then-Congresswoman Bella Abzug. Others included Betty Friedan and Phyllis Chesler. A documentary film, 25 Years of Choices: Feminism from the Ground Up (1986), was produced to honor her and her work.Hoffman's writing has appeared in numerous publications and journals including the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. Hoffman also published two studies with Adelphi University in the 80s that documented how poverty leads many women to choose abortions and showed that nearly half the women seeking abortion at CHOICES would pursue one illegally if Roe v. Wade were repealed. The study, ""Abortionomics: When Choice is a Necessity – The Impact of Recession on Abortion,"" was updated in 2011, and the results were presented at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on January 19, 2012.Hoffman began a newsletter for Choices in 1982 which developed into On the Issues: The Progressive Women's Quarterly, an acclaimed national magazine with an international following, featuring interviews by Hoffman with notable activists and thinkers, including Andrea Dworkin, Congressman John Lewis, Kate Millett, and Elie Wiesel. In 2008, On the Issues became an online magazine, extending its reach even further. For both print and online editions, Hoffman wrote editorials on subjects ranging from her visit to San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Unit in 1985 to a visit to a Rape Crisis Center in South Africa, and what is feels like to be an abortion provider in a time of attacks on clinics and murders of doctors.In 1990, she published an editorial in the Amsterdam News in response to the Central Park jogger rape case.Hoffman's memoir, Intimate Wars: The Life and Times of the Woman Who Brought Abortion from the Back Alley to the Boardroom, was published in 2012 by Feminist Press. Publishers Weekly opined that ""she eloquently chronicles more than three decades of struggles to keep abortion legal. Readers will learn much about her drive to recast 'reproductive freedom as a positive moral value.'"" Kirkus Reviews called it ""An inspiring story of a woman who participated in 'one of the greatest revolutions in history'—and is still at the forefront of the struggle.""


=== Political activism ===
Hoffman was one of the first activists to criticize Operation Rescue, an organization dedicated to ending access to abortion by blockading clinics. When Operation Rescue announced it would shut down abortion services in New York City for a week in the spring of 1988, the New York Pro-Choice Coalition, founded by Hoffman, responded by rebranding those days ""Reproductive Freedom Week,"" organizing a counter protest that drew 1,300 activists and supporters, and dispatching supporters to ensure that every clinic or doctor's offices Operation Rescue targeted remained open.During the 1989 New York City Mayoral Race, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Webster that states could limit abortion access, Hoffman and the New York Pro-Choice Coalition held a press conference to rate the candidates on this question.In 1989 Hoffman also publicly challenged New York City's Cardinal John O'Connor's support of Operation Rescue, which she deemed ""violent to women"" by organizing the first pro-choice civil disobedience action outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Several hundred participated, and nine pro-choice protestors were arrested.In January 2022 she helped to found Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, a reproductive rights coalition based in New York City.


=== Recognition and awards ===
Hoffman received the ""Bella"" Award from the Bella Abzug Leadership Institute, founded by Liz Abzug, daughter of the late Congresswoman, Bella Abzug, in 2015.The Newswomen's Club of New York awarded Hoffman the Front Page Award for her article ""Selecting the Same Sex,"" published in On The Issues. The essay about the complex issues of sex selection and abortion appeared in the Summer 2009 edition. Hoffman's essay did ""a brilliant job with a controversial subject,"" said syndicated columnist Lenore Skenazy, who presented the Opinion Writing Award to her at a dinner and ceremony in New York on Nov. 4, 2010.
The 1995 Media Award from Community Action NW was given to On the Issues for ""Exceptional Merit"" for the article, ""Let's Get Tough on Rape,"" A Discussion with Prosecutors Liz Holtzman and Alice Vachss by Hoffman.Hoffman was honored for her work by New York City Mayor Ed Koch and the Mayor's Volunteer Action Center in appreciation of ""dedicated volunteer service"" and the Department of Corrections of New York City (July 10, 1984); Friends of Animals/Eco-Visions Conference (1994).


=== Archives and legacy ===
Hoffman's Archive Collection, which features the On the Issues back catalog, CHOICES documents, and thousands of pages on the Reproductive Rights movement is in the Merle Hoffman Papers Collection, 1994 to 2001, at Duke University.In 2011, Hoffman endowed a director's position for sustained leadership of the Duke University Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.

The book's conclusions are putatively supported by research done with 1,000 Generation X professionals.In 2010, HarperCollins published Hogshead's book, Fascinate: Your 7 Triggers to Persuasion and Captivation. The book came out of research that she started in 2006, in which she had over 100,000 people take personality tests. The tests focused on ""a variety of fields and levels of professional achievements.""Fascinate: Your 7 Triggers to Persuasion and Captivation was reviewed by Publishers Weekly and described as having ""an uneven start"" but in the end it ""packs a big punch."" Another reviewer wondered ""how smaller firms and individuals can apply this stuff to their work and live. [...] It would seem like artifice and inauthenticity, perhaps, to a small businessperson who's already in perpetual survival mode.""In 2014, HarperCollins published Hogshead's book, How the World Sees You:  Discover Your Highest Value Through the Science of Fascination.

It was on the New York Times Bestseller List, and a #1 Wall Street Journal Best Seller.


=== The Fascination Advantage ===
Hogshead commissioned the Kelton Global to research why some brands are more captivating than others. They identified seven ways a person's interest can be  stimulated. In 2010, Hogshead developed an assessment to measure how an individual ranked on these seven ""triggers."" Positioned against other assessments that measured one's worldview, this test aims to show how one is perceived by others. The test has been featured on Fast Company.The assessment was called the ""F Score,"" which is a personality test used to determine one's personality archetype out of 49 ""archetypes."" The test is now called ""The Fascination Advantage Assessment."" She also tested the audiences at the Million Dollar Round Table and National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors conferences.


=== Development History ===
Hogshead commissioned the study in 2007 to Kelton Global. The study found that there are seven ways in which a person's brain can be captivated. Initially the research was applied to show how different brands captured audiences attention. Hogshead applied this research in the 2009 book Fascinate. The book applied the research from the study and introduced the concept ""triggers,"" which are different ways brands get attention.In 2010, the research was applied to people instead of brands. The test showed how a person measured against the triggers. The initial assessment was called the ""F Score."" The results presented the user with ways to use their top communications styles in their everyday lives.In 2014, Hogshead released her next book How the World Sees You. This book was built around the F-Score test, now abridged and targeted towards professionals. The assessment was re-titled ""The Fascination Advantage.""


=== The System ===
The idea of the assessment is based on Hogshead's concept of ""fascination"" which she describes as a state of intense intellectual focus. The assessment serves as a guide to show individuals how to communicate better using their best-suited triggers, or Advantages. The test treats the individual as though he or she were a brand.The assessment consists of 28 questions that rank the user on the seven advantages of the system. At the end of the assessment, the user is presented with their best and worst methods of communication.The questions are worded to find what social cues someone gives off. The results are based on the Kelton research of how others view these traits in brands. After the assessment, the individual is given a report explaining their communication-style and given a personality archetype. The archetypes are a short-hand for a user's results.

Hogshead is married and has two children and six step children. She lives in Orlando, Florida.

86,"Vicki Hollub (born 1960) is an American businesswoman and mineral engineer. She has been the president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum since April 2016, when she became the first woman heading a major American oil company.


== Early life and education ==
Vicki Hollub was born in 1960 in Birmingham, Alabama and graduated in 1977 from McAdory High School. She attended the University of Alabama, where in 1981 she earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in mineral engineering with a concentration in fuels and mineral resources. Hollub was also in the 2016 class of Distinguished Engineering Fellows from the University of Alabama College of Engineering.


== Career ==


=== Joining Occidental and Permian expansion ===
Initially working on oil rigs in Mississippi, Hollub started her career in 1981 with Cities Service, when it was a fully integrated oil and gas company. Cities Service was acquired by Occidental Petroleum Corporation in 1982. She subsequently held technical and management positions for Occidental in the United States, Russia, Venezuela, and Ecuador.In 2005, Hollub became involved in leading Occidental's expansion in the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. She was manager of operations for Occidental's Permian business from 2009 until 2011, before being promoted to president and general manager from 2011 until 2012.


=== Executive management roles ===
From 2012 until 2013 Hollub was executive vice president of Occidental's operations in California. In October 2013 she was named both Occidental Petroleum's vice president and the executive vice president of U.S. Operations, Oxy Oil and Gas, a role she held until July 2014. From 2014 until May 2015, she was the executive vice president of Occidental Petroleum and president of Occidental Oil & Gas Corp in the Americas from July 2014 until May 2015, which gave her oversight of operations in Latin America and worldwide exploration.In May 2015, Occidental's board of directors selected Hollub to succeed retiring chief executive officer (CEO) Stephen Chazen, basing their decision on Hollub's ""strong track record of successfully growing [Occidental's] domestic oil and gas business profitably and efficiently."" During a subsequent transition period she was responsible for operations in the Middle East, Latin America and the United States. In May 2015, she was named senior executive vice president of Occidental and president of Oxy Oil and Gas. Later that year, in December 2015 Hollub was appointed the global president and chief operating officer (COO) of Occidental, with oversight for the company's midstream, chemical, and oil and gas operations.


=== CEO and president ===
Hollub officially became president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, with responsibility for operations, strategy and financial management. The appointment made her the first woman to head a major American oil company, and that year Fortune named her #32 on its annual list of the Most Powerful Women in business. Hollub was appointed CEO during a severe downturn in the oil industry.  Under Hollub, Occidental cut production costs in response to falling crude prices but decided not to lay off employees. The company focused on existing core operations in the Middle East, the United States, and Colombia in Latin America, while continuing to sell low-yield fields in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, North Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Hollub placed ""particular emphasis"" on developing the Permian Basin in the southern United States, which had been a consistent driver of profits. Half of Occidental's output was coming from the Permian Basin by July 2017, while the other half came from Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia. At that time, Forbes wrote that Hollub's focus on high-producing oil fields had made Occidental ""leaner"" and ""poised to gusher cash for the next half-century.""In 2019, Occidental Petroleum acquired Anadarko Petroleum and assumed its debt. Hollub was a major proponent of the deal, and personally enlisted financing from Warren Buffett in order to complete it. Occidental did not allow shareholders to vote on the deal, which drew criticism from several major investors including sixth-largest shareholder T. Rowe Price.In March 2020 amid a major stock market crash and an international oil crisis that saw the company's stock price plummet dramatically, a group of activist investors led by Carl Icahn have stated their desire to replace the entire Occidental board of directors, including Hollub. Icahn wrote an open letter stating his view that Hollub and the board bought Anadarko to save their own jobs, and failed to protect shareholders' capital when they heavily indebted Occidental by borrowing over $40 billion in order to purchase Anadarko at a ""massive"" 65% premium.


== Boards and councils ==
She was elected to the board of directors at Occidental Petroleum in December 2015. She is the U.S. chair for the U.S.-Colombia Business Council. She also is on the boards of Khalifa University for Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi and the American Petroleum Institute. Hollub is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).


== Personal life ==
Hollub is a longtime fan of her alma mater's Alabama Crimson Tide football program, particularly under former coach Bear Bryant.

89,"Judith Richards Hope (born November 1940) is a lawyer, law professor, and corporate director. For a number of years, she served as Distinguished Visitor from Practice at Georgetown University Law Center. She is  the president and CEO of a small international consulting firm, Hope & Company, P.C. She is the former daughter-in-law of Bob Hope.


== Early life and education ==
Daughter to an Ohio Methodist minister father and social-worker mother, Hope was born in Cincinnati, Ohio,  and grew up in the small town of Defiance, Ohio, graduating from Defiance High School at the age of 16.   She graduated magna cum laude/Durant Scholar, with Special Honors in Political Science from Wellesley College and received her law degree from Harvard University, where she was one of the fifteen female students and 550 males students to graduate in 1964. Hope wrote a book about her time at Harvard Law School called Pinstripes & Pearls: The Women of the Harvard Law Class of '64 Who Forged an Old Girl Network and Paved the Way for Future Generations. She received an honorary law doctorate from Harvard University in 2000.


== Professional career ==
Hope has taught law at Harvard Law School in addition to multiple adjunct appointments at Georgetown. She served as vice chair of the President's Commission on Organized Crime under President Ronald Reagan, her tenure spanning years in which federal prosecution of organized crime made some of its greatest strides in American history.  In the administration of President Gerald Ford, Hope served as associate director of the White House Domestic Council.  She was the first woman on Harvard University's governing board, the Harvard Corporation, where she served from 1989 to 2000 and chaired among other committees the Inspection (Audit) Committee and the Honorary Degree Committee.  
Hope was a partner and senior advisor at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky, and Walker, for 24 years, serving as the first woman on that firm's (then) four-person governing Executive Committee.

== Judicial nomination ==
In April 1988, President Reagan nominated Hope to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and, more specifically, to the seat vacated by Robert Bork and later filled by Clarence Thomas.  Although not seen as controversial, Hope's nomination fell victim to election-year stalling by Senate Democrats, and her nomination expired without an up or down vote by the end of 1988, when Congress adjourned.  Reagan's successor, President George H. W. Bush, did not renew the nomination, and possibly, the New York Times speculated, as Hope served as General Counsel to Bush's primaries opponent in 1988, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Bush ultimately tapped Clarence Thomas for the seat.

Her previous roles include chief executive officer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and executive director of Film Independent.


== Early life ==
Dawn Hudson was born in 1956 in Hot Springs, Arkansas. She is a graduate of Harvard University. She attended graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis and the Grenoble Institute of Political Studies in Grenoble, France. She has an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from Antioch University Los Angeles.


== Career ==


=== Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (2011-2022) ===
Dawn Hudson was the first person to hold the role of chief executive officer at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As CEO, Dawn Hudson oversaw the academy's 450-person staff in Los Angeles, New York, and London, as well as operations, awards (including the Oscars), membership, marketing, communications, finance, technology, and the Academy Foundation. The Foundation includes educational initiatives, fellowships and grants, the Margaret Herrick Library and the Academy Film Archive.From the beginning of her tenure in 2011, Hudson led the development and creation of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, a 300,000 square-foot museum designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano. The Academy Museum features 50,000 square feet of exhibition space and two state-of-the-art theaters (the 1,000-seat David Geffen Theater and the 288-seat Ted Mann Theater). The museum opened to the public in September 2021 and is the largest museum in the United States devoted to the arts and sciences of moviemaking. Hudson was a member of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures Board of Trustees.With Hudson at the helm building and overseeing its financial assets, the academy's assets more than tripled from $258 million to $894 million. In addition to the Oscars, the academy became more accessible to its members and people around the world through the modernization of its infrastructure and online outreach.

97,"Donna Rice Hughes (born January 7, 1958) is American activist, author, speaker and film producer who is president and chairperson of Enough Is Enough. In her work with Enough is Enough, Hughes has appeared on a variety of outlets as an Internet safety advocate.  She first became known as a key figure in a widely publicized 1987 political scandal that contributed to the end of the second campaign of former Senator Gary Hart for the Democratic Party nomination for president.


== Early life ==
Rice grew up in the Irmo area near Columbia, South Carolina. She attended Irmo High School and the University of South Carolina, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. She graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in biology.After graduating from college, Rice won the Miss South Carolina World beauty pageant. She went to New York to compete nationally. Rice later moved to Miami, where she worked as a marketing representative for pharmaceutical giant Wyeth Laboratories in South Florida. She also worked as an actress, appearing in TV commercials, a 1986 episode of the TV series Miami Vice, an episode of the soap opera One Life to Live, and the movie The Last Plane Out.


== 1987 political scandal ==
Rice met former Senator Gary Hart at a 1986-87 New Year's Eve Party at the Aspen, Colorado, home of her then boyfriend, rocker Don Henley. She later met Hart in Miami, and said she was ""very interested in getting into fund-raising"". Soon after meeting Rice, Hart announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for president. Having enjoyed a surprisingly strong campaign in 1984 against the eventual nominee, former vice president Walter Mondale, he was widely perceived as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 1988. Shortly thereafter, rumors began circulating that he was a ""womanizer"", leading Hart to invite the media to observe his public behavior and to claim that anybody who did so would ""be very bored.""In a controversial move, Miami Herald reporters stalked Rice on a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., then staked out Hart's townhouse following a phone call from someone trying to sell pictures from the trip. There, the Herald's Jim McGee saw Hart and Rice return to Hart's townhouse. The Herald reported that Rice had spent the night at Hart's residence, but later conceded that it had not watched the back door, through which she could have left.Their story was published on the same day that his quotation appeared in The New York Times Magazine. The ensuing report sent the media into frenzy. Hart said that the reporters could not know exactly when Rice arrived or why she was there,  and Rice denied that she had slept at Hart's house or that the relationship was sexual. Hart also denied the story's accuracy.Hart's popular appeal suffered, and polls taken almost immediately afterward found him 10 points behind Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in New Hampshire. On May 8, 1987, a week after the story broke, Hart suspended his campaign after the Washington Post threatened to run a story about a woman Hart had dated while separated from his wife, and his wife and daughter became similar subjects of interest for tabloid newspapers.


=== Monkey Business photo ===
On the cover of its June 2, 1987 edition, the celebrity tabloid National Enquirer published a photograph of Rice sitting on Hart's lap. The pair were pictured on a dock during a yacht trip to Bimini that Hart, Rice, and others took before he announced his presidential campaign. Hart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words Monkey Business, the yacht's name. The photo was published alongside the headline ""Gary Hart Asked Me to Marry Him"". It was published weeks after Hart suspended his campaign, but has been subsequently collectively mistaken for the reason for Hart's exit. There are allegations that Republican operative Lee Atwater set the photo up to discredit Hart.Rice and Hart have consistently denied that their relationship was sexual and said they were just friends.The scandal is depicted in the 2018 film The Front Runner, with Rice played by Sara Paxton.


=== Aftermath ===
The enormous publicity generated by the Hart scandal resulted in numerous lucrative offers, and while Rice refused most – including one for an interview with Playboy magazine, an ABC movie of the week, book and magazine offers – she did appear in 1987 as the No Excuses jeans girl in commercials and advertisements for No Excuses jeans. She said, ""A month after the scandal broke, I tried to go back to work at the pharmaceutical company after a leave of absence. But because of all the publicity and resulting pressure and stress, I finally resigned."" A month after the scandal broke, she began reconnecting with her Christian faith and then disappeared from the public eye for seven years. Rice lived in Los Angeles briefly, then moved to the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia in the early 1990s. There she married Jack Hughes, a businessman, in May 1994.


== Advocacy ==
Since 1994, when she became communications director and spokesperson for Enough Is Enough, an American secular nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to make the Internet safer for families and children, Hughes has been an advocate and speaker on the issue of protecting children online. She became president and CEO of the organization in 2002. The organization has produced an Internet Safety 101SM program with the Department of Justice and other partners. She is the executive producer, host and instructor of the Internet Safety 101 DVD series, which ran as a TV series on PBS, garnering Hughes an Emmy nomination in 2012 and the series an Emmy Award in 2013.Hughes has testified before multiple congressional hearings on protecting children online. She and Enough Is Enough supported the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996, the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). Senator Trent Lott appointed Hughes to serve on the COPA Commission, and she co-chaired the COPA Hearings on filtering/ratings/labeling technologies. She also serves on various Internet safety advisory boards and task forces, including the 2006 Virginia Attorney General's Youth Internet Safety Task Force and the 2008 Internet Safety Technical Task Force, formed with MySpace and the U.S. Attorneys General. Beyond addressing the dangers of Internet pornography, Hughes has also spoken into the issue of privacy online, teen suicide and the impact of cyberbullying. She has received numerous awards, including the National Law Center for Children and Families Annual Appreciation Award, and the ""Protector of Children Award"" and Media Impact Award from the National Abstinence Clearinghouse. In 2013, Hughes received the Women in Technology Leadership Award for ""Social Impact"".In 2014, Enough is Enough's ""National Porn Free Wi-Fi"" campaign"" encouraged McDonald's and Starbucks to add filters to block pornography on their wi-fi networks. In 2016, McDonald's implemented a filtered wi-fi policy in most of its 14,000 stores. Starbucks followed suit and announced it would implement a global policy as well. That same year, Hughes won the 2014 Professional Women in Advocacy Excellence In Advocacy Award for ""Veteran Practitioner"".Enough Is Enough sponsored a ""Children's Internet Safety Presidential Pledge"" in 2016, asking presidential candidates to pledge to combat both Internet pornography—including both illegal child pornography and legal adult pornography—if elected president. The Pledge states that if elected president, the pledging person will ""uphold the rule of law by aggressively enforcing existing federal laws to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online, including the federal obscenity laws, child pornography laws, sexual predation laws and the sex trafficking laws.""

108,"Rachel Jacobs (October 3, 1975 – May 12, 2015) was an American businesswoman and social entrepreneur. She was killed at age 39 in the 2015 Philadelphia train derailment while commuting between her home in New York and the Philadelphia offices of ApprenNet, the educational technology company she had recently joined as CEO.


== Early life and education ==
Jacobs grew up in Huntington Woods, Michigan, the daughter of Gilda Jacobs, a former Michigan state senator. She was a 1993 graduate of Berkley High School, a 1997 graduate of Swarthmore College, and a 2002 graduate of Columbia Business School. Jacobs moved to New York City in 2000.


== Career ==
Jacobs was CEO of ApprenNet, a video-learning tech company which was cofounded by Karl Okamoto, a law professor at Drexel University. The company ""provides tools for instructors to create video-based learning exercises."" Before joining ApprenNet, Jacobs worked for the education-technology firm Ascend Learning where she was vice president of business innovation. According to Okamoto, the two met because ApprenNet was doing business with Ascend and Jacobs ""was our customer before she became our colleague.""In a career The Washington Post described as ""moving from one big job to the next,"" Jacobs' first job out of business school was as a manager at the Pragma Corporation, based in Kyrgyzstan, where she helped the government develop IT strategies. She next worked for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. In 2007, Jacobs joined McGraw Hill, where she ""led the expansion of McGraw-Hill's career-learning business into China, India and the Middle East.""Jacobs was hired to lead ApprenNet, which is backed by the National Science Foundation, in an expansion from its original focus on educating lawyers, into a phase to apply its online teaching technology to training health-care professionals, college level instruction and training for K-12 teachers.Following Jacobs's death, ApprenNet merged with Handsfree Learning of California.


=== Social activism ===
In 2009, Jacobs organized 635 Mile Road, a non-profit organization of former Detroit-area residents ""dedicated to improving the flow of funds, ideas and energy between native Detroiters."" By the end of 2010, 635 Mile Road became Detroit Nation. The organization soon had chapters in chapters in New York, Seattle, Chicago, and other cities dedicated to helping Detroit natives who continue supporting the region after moving away. The group offers free consulting to Detroit-based, grassroots entrepreneurs and artists. Through Detroit Nation, Jacobs helped arrange the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's first Carnegie Hall concert in 17 years. By the time the group held a Detroit ex-pats meet-up in their hometown in 2014, the group had 10,000 members online. Detroit Nation raised money for Detroit charities with fund-raising events held by expats in Seattle, Chicago, New York and other cities, but, as Jacobs explained to an interviewer in 2011, the ex-pats also provide ""human capital... helping organizations to better integrate social networking tools, develop marketing materials, or structure the organization and bring in larger donors.""In 2014, Jacobs was one of 150 business leaders invited to attend the first annual Detroit Homecoming. Interviewed during the Homecoming, Jacobs told The Detroit News that, ""Detroit doesn't need ideas. It has phenomenal ideas. It needs doers... My challenge to expats is who will raise their hand and be a doer in Detroit?""


== Personal life ==
She was married to Todd Waldman, who as of 2015 worked for Navigant Consulting; the couple had one son. Jacobs and Waldman had been considering whether to move the family to Philadelphia.


== Death ==
Media attention focused on Jacobs in the hours after the crash because she was known to have been on the train but had not been identified among the injured and the dead. ApprenNet co-founder and COO Emily Foote went to the crash scene to try to locate Jacobs by showing her photograph to survivors and rescue workers.Hundreds of people attended memorial services held at the Greenwich Village campus of Hebrew Union College on Saturday, May 16, 2015.

Rachel often spoke to others about how her camp experiences help shape her identity during her formative years.  Beginning in 2016, this award will go to one summer staff member each year who embodies Rachel's values for healing or repairing the world (the Hebrew translation of Tikkun Olam).Daily News columnist Mike Lupica demanded a full investigation of Amtrak safety from the National Transportation Safety Board to prevent future tragedies in which a two-year-old child ""grows up without a mother.""  Assigned to ride on the first train through Philadelphia after the derailment, columnist Ronnie Polaneczky wrote for The Philadelphia Inquirer that, ""The next time I sigh that I can't afford to fix the roof or haven't time to help a friend move across the country, I will try to remind myself that Rachel Jacobs would have given anything to still be here to indulge such petty worries.""

109,"Leila Janah (October 9, 1982 – January 24, 2020) was an American businesswoman. She was the founder and CEO of Sama and LXMI. Sama's 11,000 employees have worked under contracts with companies including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Walmart, Getty Images, Glassdoor and Vulcan Capital.


== Early life ==
Janah was born on October 9, 1982, in Lewiston, New York, near Niagara Falls, and grew up in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. She was the daughter of Indian immigrants, who came to the United States with nothing. Janah described her childhood as being difficult, often due to a lack of financial security. As a teenager, Janah worked many jobs, including babysitting and tutoring. She attended the California Academy of Mathematics and Science. She won a scholarship at 17 through American Field Services, and convinced them to let her spend it teaching in Ghana where she spent 6 months during her senior year of high school. In Ghana, Janah taught English to young students in the village of Akuapem, many of whom were blind. Janah has cited this early experience as sparking her passion for working in Africa, and she continued to visit the continent during her time in college.Janah attended Harvard University, graduating in 2005 with a degree in African Development Studies. While at Harvard, Janah conducted fieldwork in Mozambique, Senegal and Rwanda and was a consultant for and author of papers for the World Bank's Development Research Group and Ashoka on social and economic rights.


== Career ==
Upon graduation, Janah worked as a management consultant with Katzenbach Partners, focusing on healthcare, mobile and outsourcing companies. One of Janah's first assignments with Katzenbach Partners was managing a call center in Mumbai. At the call center Janah met a young man who traveled each day by rickshaw from Dharavi, one of the largest slums in South Asia, to work at the center. Janah has cited this experience as sparking the inspiration for Samasource, the non-profit she founded in 2008.Janah left Katzenbach Partners in 2007 to become a visiting scholar at Stanford University with the Program on Global Justice, founded by law professor Joshua Cohen. That year, she co-founded Incentives for Global Health with Thomas Pogge, Leitner Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs at Yale, and Aidan Hollis, a professor of economics at the University of Calgary, which established a blueprint for incentivizing the development of new drugs for neglected diseases.


=== Sama ===
In 2008, Janah launched Samasource (then called Market for Change), an idea that was inspired by her time spent in Africa and her experience managing a call center in Mumbai. One of the first organizations to engage in impact sourcing, Sama workers are trained in basic computer skills and paid a local living wage for their labor.Additionally, Sama provides a host of impact programs to ensure their workers are advancing in their careers and learning life skills. These programs include health and wellness education, professional skills development, a scholarship program to assist with continuing education costs, and the GiveWork Challenge—a program to provide micro loans and mentorship to aspiring entrepreneurs. Sama has been named one of Fast Company's ""Most Innovative Companies"" and counts Walmart, Google, General Motors and Microsoft among its clients.


=== Samaschool ===
In 2013, Janah founded Samaschool (previously SamaUSA), a program that moves people out of poverty by providing digital skills training and a connection to internet-based jobs that pay a living wage. Samaschool operated in-person programs in Arkansas, California, New York and Kenya, as well as online classes internationally. Samaschool courses trained students in digital literacy, workforce readiness and freelancing.Samaschool started with a pilot program in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood in San Francisco. The model originally focused on training students to perform digital work competitively, to prepare them for success on online work sites like Taskrabbit and Upwork (then oDesk and Elance). The program was first introduced in a 2011 TechCrunch article[12] which attracted controversy for its assertion that Americans could compete with African and Asian workers who can afford to take assignments that pay lower fees. Samaschool later shifted its focus to teach students the skills necessary to gain work in the gig economy. Samaschool was funded in part by the Robinhood Foundation.
Samaschool closed operations in 2020, with the core training curriculum being acquired by a U.S. foundation.


=== Samahope ===
Janah founded Samahope in 2012, the first crowdfunding platform that directly funded doctors who provide life-changing medical treatments for women and children in poor communities. Samahope enabled anyone anywhere to directly fund doctors' life-changing medical treatments for women and children in need. Samahope was built on the belief that transparent funding mechanisms could help close the global surgery gap and ensure that all people have access to medical treatments. Samahope combined with Johnson & Johnson's new global health platform, CaringCrowd, at the close of December 2015. Janah spoke about the decision to merge with Caring Crowd in a LinkedIn post, citing efficiency and branding as the two biggest factors.


=== LXMI ===
In 2015, Janah co-founded LXMI, a for-profit luxury skin care brand. LXMI employs marginalized women in the rural Nile Valley communities to harvest LXMI ingredients and reports that their producers earn 3 times the average local wages. LXMI is named after the Hindu goddess of beauty and prosperity.LXMI was incubated at Sama. Janah and Sama are members of an LLC which owns LXMI, along with LXMI employees and investors. The LLC was set up for LXMI in order for Janah to donate the 1/3 of her shares back to Sama in a way that would give Sama oversight in the company. If LXMI pays a dividend or is acquired, Sama would stand to benefit.


== Awards and honors ==
Janah was a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum, a Director of CARE USA, a 2012 TechFellow, recipient of the inaugural Club de Madrid Young Leadership Award, and the youngest person to win a Heinz Award in 2014 when she received the 19th Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.

She previously served as the senior advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama and assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs from 2009 to 2017. Before that, she served as a co-chair of the Obama–Biden Transition Project.She has been the CEO of the Obama Foundation since October 2021.


== Early life and education ==
Jarrett was born in Shiraz, Iran, during the Shah's rule, to American parents James E. Bowman and Barbara T. Bowman. Her father, a pathologist and geneticist, worked at a hospital in Shiraz in 1956. When she was five years old, the family moved to London for a year, later moving to Chicago in 1963.Her parents are African-American of African and European descent. On the television series Finding Your Roots, DNA testing indicated that Jarrett is of 49% European, 46% African, and 5% Native American descent. Among her European roots, she was found to have French and Scottish ancestry. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Robert Robinson Taylor, was the first accredited African-American architect, and the first African-American student enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jarrett's father once told her that her great-grandfather was Jewish. Her maternal grandfather, Robert Rochon Taylor, was chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority in the 1940s.As a child, Jarrett spoke Persian, French, and English. In 1966, her mother was one of four child advocates who created the Erikson Institute. The institute was established to provide collective knowledge in child development for teachers and other professionals working with young children.Jarrett graduated from Northfield Mount Hermon School in 1974, and earned a B.A. in psychology from Stanford University in 1978 and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981. On May 21, 2016, she received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Colby College in Waterville, Maine.


== Career ==


=== Chicago municipal politics ===
Jarrett got her start in Chicago politics in 1987 working for Mayor Harold Washington as deputy corporation counsel for finance and development.Jarrett continued to work in the Chicago mayor's office in the 1990s. She was deputy chief of staff for Mayor Richard Daley, during which time (1991) she hired Michelle Robinson (who was then engaged to Barack Obama) from a private law firm. Jarrett served as commissioner of the department of planning and development from 1992 through 1995, and she was chairwoman of the Chicago Transit Authority from 1995 to 2003.


=== Business administration ===
From 1995 to 2009, Jarrett was the CEO of the Habitat Company, a real estate development and management company, She was replaced as CEO by Mark Sega when she joined the Obama administration. Daniel E. Levin is the chairman of Habitat, which was formed in 1971. Jarrett was a member of the board of Chicago Stock Exchange (2000–2007, as chairman, 2004–2007).
Jarrett was a member of the board of trustees of the University of Chicago Medical Center from 1996 to 2009, becoming vice chairwoman in 2002 and chairwoman in 2006. She also served as vice chairwoman of the board of trustees of the University of Chicago and a trustee of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Jarrett serves on the board of directors of USG Corporation, a Chicago-based building materials corporation.


=== Advisor to Barack Obama ===
Jarrett was one of President Obama's longest serving advisors and confidantes and was ""widely tipped for a high-profile position in an Obama administration.""
Unlike Bert Lance, who arrived from Georgia with President [Jimmy] Carter and became his budget director, or Karen Hughes, who was President [George W.] Bush's communications manager, Ms. Jarrett isn't a confidante with a particular portfolio. What she does share with these counterparts is a fierce sense of loyalty and a refusal to publicly say anything that may reflect poorly on the candidate—or steal his thunder.
On November 14, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama selected Jarrett to serve as a senior advisor to the president and assistant to the president for intergovernmental relations and public liaison.Jarrett was one of three senior advisors to President Obama. She held the retitled position of assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs and public engagement, managed the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Office of Urban Affairs; she also chaired the White House Council on Women and Girls and the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport. She was part of the U.S. State Visit to the UK in May 2011.She said that the 2011 report Women in America, which the administration produced for the Council on Women and Girls, would be used to guide policy-making.Jarrett had a staff of approximately three dozen and received full-time Secret Service protection. Jarrett's role as both a friend of the Obamas and as senior advisor in the White House was controversial:  in his memoirs Robert M. Gates, former secretary of defense, discussed his objection to her involvement in foreign security affairs; David Axelrod reported in his memoirs about Rahm Emanuel's attempts to have her selected as Obama's replacement in the senate, due to concerns about the difficulty in working with a family friend in a major policy role.


=== Additional leadership positions ===
In addition to being senior advisor to the president, Jarrett held other leadership positions and completed further duties. Among those included chairing the White House Council on Women and Girls and co-chairing the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. In March 2014, she participated as a speaker on Voices in Leadership, an original Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health webcast series, in a discussion entitled, ""Leadership in the White House,"" moderated by Dr. Atul Gawande.


=== Relationship with the Obamas ===
In 1991, as deputy chief of staff to Mayor Richard Daley, Jarrett interviewed Michelle Robinson for an opening in the mayor's office, after which she immediately offered Robinson the job. Robinson asked for time to think and also asked Jarrett to meet her fiancé, Barack Obama. The three ended up meeting for dinner. After the dinner, Robinson accepted the job with the mayor's office. It was at this time that Jarrett reportedly took the couple under her wing and ""introduced them to a wealthier and better-connected Chicago than their own."" When Jarrett later left her position at the mayor's office to head the Chicago department of planning and development, Michelle Obama went with her.


=== Support for 2008 US Presidential Election ===
Obama's election team and supporters, for example at the Philadelphia National Constitution Center speech, included Valerie Jarrett, David Plouffe and David Axelrod, all whom later joined him and First Lady Michelle Obama in the White House.


=== Post-Obama administration ===
Since leaving the White House, Jarrett has volunteered as a senior advisor to the Obama Foundation. In 2017 she was appointed to the board of directors of Ariel Investments, and joined the board of directors of 2U, Inc., Lyft, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She is also the co-chair of the United State of Women, chair of the Board of When We All Vote, and a senior advisor to ATTN:. In January 2018 she became a distinguished senior fellow at the University of Chicago Law School.In July 2017 Jarrett signed a deal with Viking Press for her book titled Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward.In December 2020, following the announcement that Obama Foundation President Wally Adeyemo would be nominated to become Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Foundation announced that Jarrett would take over his duties on an interim basis until a successor can be found.


== In popular culture ==
Along with Donna Brazile, vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, she is one of the political figures to make a cameo appearance as herself in the CBS drama The Good Wife.


== Personal life ==
In 1983 she married William Robert Jarrett, son of Chicago Sun-Times reporter Vernon Jarrett. She attributes her switch from a private to a public career to the birth of their daughter, and her own desire to do something that would make their daughter proud. Her daughter, Laura Jarrett, would go on to become an attorney and reporter for CNN and is now a senior 
legal correspondent at NBC and Saturday Today co-anchor, and daughter-in-law of the Canadian politician Bas Balkissoon.To one reporter's emailed question about her divorce, she replied, ""Married in 1983, separated in 1987, and divorced in 1988. Enough said."" In a Vogue profile, she further explained, ""We grew up together. We were friends since childhood. In a sense, he was the boy next door. I married without really appreciating how hard divorce would be."" William Jarrett died on November 19, 1993, at age 40, and at the time of his death he was director of obstetrics and gynecology at Jackson Park Hospital.In 2018, Jarrett was the target of a tweet by Roseanne Barr. Barr said, in reference to Jarrett, it was as though the “muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a baby”. In response to her attack on Jarrett, Barr was released by her talent agency ICM and lost her television role on Roseanne.

""Jenkins, Carol 1944–"", Encyclopedia.com."
114,"F. Suzanne Jenniches (born 1949) is an American engineer who served from April 2, 2003, to 2010 as the vice president and general manager of Government Systems Division of Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Electronic Systems sector. She holds a patent for laser soldering. She was the only woman to take engineering evening classes at Johns Hopkins University in the 1970s. She was among the first women to do so at that University. She was both the first female engineer and, therefore, the first intern at Westinghouse Electric Company. She is one of the first female leaders at Northrop Grumman, and considered a pioneer by the Society of Women Engineers.


== Early life ==
The firstborn of one son and two daughters, Jenniches is the first in her family to have a college degree. Her parents both graduated from high school and owned their own business. Running a business required long, 12- to 14-hour work days. Jenniches learned the value of work ethic through her parents.
Jenniches's parents also taught her personal responsibility. They told her that if there was a
problem at school, then she must have contributed to it-

because your teachers -- why would they set out to do something that would hurt you? And so I learned early on to sort of take responsibility for myself and what happened to me, not to find other reasons outside of myself for not succeeding, but realizing that my success depended upon myself and the participation and contribution that I made.  – Suzanne Jenniches
Every Christmas, Jenniches' father, a mechanic with a service station garage and correspondence trade school student, gave her a power tool as a present. When she moved on to college, she brought the tools with her: sanders, circular saws, miter boxes, drills, and other equipment. Atypical for women at the time, it was Jenniches, not her husband, who supplied mechanical tools for the household.
In high school, Jenniches's guidance counselor encouraged her to go to college. Therefore, when Clarion recruiters visited her school, Jenniches accepted their invitation and applied to one school. She received a full scholarship. In hindsight, even though her engineering career ultimately succeeded, she regretted the early aimlessness and lack of planning.

My expectations were that I would be a beautician, which is a very honorable vocation in Western Pennsylvania, but never did I ever think of becoming a teacher or becoming an engineer... My whole childhood was a series of bumping into fortunate experiences. That’s why I’m so active in the Society of Women Engineers, I really want young people not to have to bump along, but to have people that help them along the way. – Suzanne Jenniches


== Education ==
In 1970, Jenniches earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Clarion State College (now, Clarion University of Pennsylvania). Engineering was not an option. She believed there were only two choices open to her as a young female biology major: a nurse or a teacher. She became a biology teacher.
While working as a teacher, Jenniches began to work toward an engineering degree. She attended evening school at Johns Hopkins, four nights a week, for seven years. She was the only woman at the evening engineering school for a number of years. In 1979, Jenniches earned a master's degree in environmental engineering from Johns Hopkins University.
Jenniches completed extensive post-graduate work in international affairs at The Catholic University of America. She has also attended the Harvard Business School Program for Management Development.


== Career ==
Jenniches began her career in science as a high school biology teacher, teaching ecology, in Westminster, Maryland. During this time, she received a magazine in the mail from the National Education Association. It was 1970, the first year of Earth Day. On the back cover, she found an ad from Johns Hopkins University. There was a post card to fill, tear out, and send in. Once again, she decided to change her career path on a whim. She applied to go to graduate school at Johns Hopkins by impulse. One of the items on the back cover flyer was the environmental engineering.

At Johns Hopkins's evening school, Jenniches's peers influenced her to work at Westinghouse Electric Company. It was the first time Westinghouse attained a female engineer, so they had to create an unusual exception for her: an internship. She would be the only woman there, and the only person that had ever had an internship. Jenniches accepted the unique opportunity. She quit teaching and worked at Westinghouse as an associate engineer. She worked there, as an intern and a woman, for two weeks, unpaid, in a plant, with no security clearance, all while still attending evening classes to complete her engineering degree. No one had ever done that before. As a part of her job, she used keypunch digital tapes to program read-only memories, a PROM programmer. She worked harder than most people. Therefore, she would often be on-call, sometimes waking from home at 3 o'clock in the morning to attend to emergency data requirements.In the beginning of her engineer career, Jenniches changed jobs every eighteen months for two years. She kept the same telephone number and used it to advance her career within the company. She worked in computer test engineering, electronic assembly, advanced robotic manufacturing, radar systems, and defense programs. She engineered for Northrop Grumman (previously known as Westinghouse), and stayed at that corporation for more than thirty years.
In 1980, she obtained a patent for laser soldering. In 1981 she led operations for the B-1B bomber offensive radar. She oversaw the production of the first electronically scanned antenna for production aircraft in the world.
Jenniches has served in many leadership positions at Northrop Grumman Corp: In 1986, she was appointed manager of Systems & Technology Operations. Later she became Vice President of Automation and Information Systems, Vice President of Communications Systems (Electronic Systems sector). In 2003, she became the Vice President of the Government Systems Division.

115,"Christine Jennings (born November 26, 1945) is a banker and businesswoman, and a Democratic politician in Florida. She formerly served as the chair of the Sarasota County Democratic Party.
In 2006, Jennings was the Democratic nominee for the United States Congress to represent Florida's 13th congressional district. The seat was left open when incumbent Katherine Harris ran for the U.S. Senate.
In the 2006 election, 237,861 votes were cast, but for unknown reasons, 18,382 of the electronic ballots in Sarasota County recorded no vote for a congressional candidate. By the tally of the remaining votes, Jennings received 373 fewer votes than her opponent, Republican Vern Buchanan. Of the counted votes in Sarasota County, Jennings won 52.8%. If the missing votes had broken for Jennings by the same percentage as the counted votes in Sarasota County, the Democrat would have won the race by about 600 votes instead of losing by 368, according to a review by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.An audit of the machines found nothing wrong, and it is believed that some voters failed to vote for the congressional candidate because it was on the same page as the crowded governor's race. Other voters who failed to vote in the congressional race initially were able to catch the mistake on the review page of the ballot. Still others, who had voted, noticed their votes had not been recorded when they reviewed the votes at the end. There has been no explanation as to why some votes did not record after they were made.
Jennings, a former Republican, never graduated from college and started her career as a bank teller at the age of 17. In 1992, she founded Sarasota Bank, which was bought by Colonial Bank in 2003 for $40.5 million.In her career as a banker, Jennings rose to become president, CEO, chairman of the board and director of Sarasota Bank. She also served as president of the Sarasota Downtown Association and president of the Sarasota Film Festival.


== Congressional elections ==


=== 2004 ===
Jennings lost the 2004 primary for the seat to the eventual nominee, Jan Schneider, by 47% to 38% in a four-candidate race, despite outspending Schneider by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1. ""Her supporters attribute this outcome, though, to Jennings’ late start, and they say her business background gives her both better cross-party appeal and stronger fundraising potential.""


=== 2006 ===

Jennings won 61.8% of the vote in the September 5, 2006 Democratic primary, having heavily outraised Schneider during the campaign. CQPolitics.com wrote that while Schneider had run game challenges to Harris as the Democratic nominee in 2002 and 2004, ""[her] strongest appeal was to more liberal elements of the 13th District constituency, and many Democratic officials thought Jennings’ business background would make her a more viable general election contender"".Poll numbers showed Jennings with a lead, which varied from 2–12% based on five polls.In November, Jennings faced Republican Vern Buchanan, who won a bitterly fought Republican primary with 32.3% of the vote. Buchanan's fund-raising receipts more than tripled those of Jennings, including infusions of nearly $6 million of his own money. Jennings was endorsed by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the major newspaper in District 13.After the votes were counted, Buchanan narrowly led Jennings by fewer than four hundred votes. In Sarasota County, Florida, there were almost 18,000 undervotes in the race. Some advocated for a revote, but that rarely occurs in Florida, and would have been a first in Florida for the federal office.
In March 2007 a letter surfaced ""in which Electronic Systems & Software Inc. (ES&S)— the company that manufactured the electronic voting machines used in the Florida 13 election—told election officials that the voting screens exhibited slow response times during testing.""  The following week ""California Democratic Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald, chairwoman of the House Administration Committee ... announced the formation of the task force"" to investigate the election.The House committee dismissed Jennings' challenge on February 25, 2008, and affirmed the certified result of the FL-13 declaring Buchanan the winner of the 2006 election. The full House of Representatives affirmed the committee's findings in HR 989, declaring that machine error could not be demonstrated after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review in Sarasota. Jennings dropped her challenge to the race shortly after to focus on her 2008 Congressional rematch against Buchanan.


=== 2008 ===

Jennings announced her intention to run for the 13th District seat once again in 2008. On September 6, 2007, she received the endorsement of Emily's List.  Jennings lost to incumbent Vern Buchanan, taking just 37% of the vote.


=== Payroll tax controversy ===
In August 2007, while Jennings continued her court contest of the 2006 Congressional race results, the Herald-Tribune reported on a lawsuit filed by Democratic primary candidate Jan Schneider through the Federal Elections Commission (FEC). The lawsuit alleged that Jennings collected but failed to file and submit payroll taxes collected from her campaign staff during the 2006 election. Initially the Jennings campaign admitted that they had failed to pay $23,835 in payroll taxes during the campaign as a consequence of a paperwork error that was cleared up as soon as it was found. Said Jennings, ""when I found out about it, I corrected it"".However, the next day the Jennings campaign stated that the amount of unpaid payroll taxes was closer to $38,000, but IRS and campaign records indicated that the amount of repaid payroll taxes since July 2006 amounted to $70,126. The revelations followed a 2006 election where Jennings spoke at length about Buchanan's refusal to release his personal tax returns; upon the breaking of the controversy, Schneider referred to the news as a demonstration of ""shameful hypocrisy"" on the part of Jennings.
