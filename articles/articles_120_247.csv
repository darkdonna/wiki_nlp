Following high school, she went to college at Northwestern University located in Chicago where she received her degree in journalism and global health. While still in college she began working as a journalist writing about various startups in Chicago. Audrey received her degree from Northwestern University in 2015.

A year later, 2014, she realized she wanted to change the trajectory of her path and make her own difference in the world. Leading her to begin working for a venture capitalist company called Savannah Fund based in Kenya. Audrey soon discovered form the International Labour Organization that a big chunk of college graduates are unemployed and that only 1%  of computer science majors find jobs in their field because a lot of programs they learn in school do not accurately prepare them for the fast changing technological world. Audrey soon realized the significant problem for a majority of companies in Kenya was that they were having a hard time finding people with the right skills to fill positions in their company. She discovered the pain point of the company's problem and why there was low employment for computer science graduates was because the computer science program they learned in university was taught in a theoretical perspective instead of coding which was how computer science was taught in other universities. Furthermore, because computer science majors weren't learning coding at their universities they were unable to land jobs in their field which lead to companies having a hard time finding people to fill the coding positions at their company.


== Moringa School ==
Soon Audrey founded the Moringa School located in Nairobi, Kenya. She created a learning accelerator, a program where she would teach recent IT graduates the basic technological skills like coding needed to obtain a job in that industry.The basis of the program is to equip students with the right skills needed for companies to hire them. Not only does this program benefit the students but it also helps various companies in Kenya progress vastly because they now have the right people with the right skills to advance their companies. 95% of the school's graduates have received jobs at formidable companies not just in Kenya but throughout Africa and the world. The program has allowed students to not only receive their first job but also double their salary within a month by supplying them skills needed to succeed. Throughout Audrey's seven years leading the school, she developed and guided a team of over 100 people to train over 4000 students in both Kenya and Rwanda. Audrey has expanded her learning accelerator program to places like Hong Kong, Pakistan, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.


== Achievements ==
In 2016, Audrey was featured in Forbes 30 under 30 for her social innovation of creating the learner accelerator and the Moringa School. Some of the other achievements she received for her innovation is being featured in Cartier's Women's initiative, in 2016 the World Economic Forum recognized her as one of the top five women innovators in Africa, and in 2018 the company itself was recognized as one of the most innovative companies in Africa. The Moringa School continues to operate and has set a goal by 2030 to train over 200,000 students with the skills needed to advance themselves in the technological sphere.
In March 2021, Audrey stepped down as CEO but still operates on the board of directors for the school where she will continue to advance educational programs all over africa. Audrey is currently a member of I&P's Education to Employment Fund where they are working to create and fund  a three year program to advance educational institutions and companies to help provide students with the right skills to launch their careers and become successful focusing in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal.

Her success was built upon stylish yet affordable apparel for career women featuring colorfully tailored separates that could be mixed and matched. Claiborne is best known for co-founding Liz Claiborne Inc., which in 1986 became the first company founded by a woman to make the Fortune 500 list. Claiborne was the first woman to become chair and CEO of a Fortune 500 company.


== Early life and education ==
Claiborne was born in Brussels to American parents. She came from a prominent Louisiana family with an ancestor, William C. C. Claiborne, who served as Louisiana's first governor after statehood, during the War of 1812.In 1939, at the start of World War II, the family returned to New Orleans. Claiborne attended St. Timothy's School for Girls, a small boarding school in Maryland. She and her sisters moved to Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, where she attended, but did not graduate from, Mountain Lakes High School.Rather than finishing high school, Claiborne went to Europe to study art in the studios of painters. Her father did not believe that she needed an education, so she studied art informally.


== Career ==
In 1949, Claiborne won the Jacques Heim National Design Contest (sponsored by Harper's Bazaar), and then moved to Manhattan where she worked for years in the Garment District on Seventh Avenue, as a sketch artist at Tina Leser, the sportswear producer. She also worked for the former Hollywood costume designer-turned-fashion designer, Omar Kiam. She worked as a designer for the Dan Keller and Youth Group Inc. fashion labels.


=== Liz Claiborne Inc. ===

Claiborne became frustrated by the failure of the companies that employed her to provide practical clothes for working women, so, with husband Art Ortenberg, Leonard Boxer, and Jerome Chazen, she launched her own design company, Liz Claiborne Inc., in 1976. It was an immediate success, with sales of $2 million in 1976 and $23 million in 1978. By 1988, it had acquired one-third of the American women's upscale sportswear market.Marketing strategies that Claiborne developed changed the nature of retail stores. For example, Claiborne insisted that her line of clothing be displayed separately, as a department to itself and including all of the items she offered. This was the first time customers were able to select many types of clothing articles by brand name alone in one location of a department store. That tradition for the grouping of special brands has become the typical arrangement for name brands in contemporary stores.
In 1980, Liz Claiborne Accessories was founded through employee Nina McLemore (who decades later would launch a label of her own, in 2001). Liz Claiborne Inc. went public in 1981 and made the Fortune 500 list in 1986 with retail sales of $1.2 billion.Claiborne listed all employees in her corporate directory in alphabetical order, to circumvent what she perceived as male hierarchies. She controlled meetings by ringing a glass bell and became famous for her love of red—""Liz Red"". She sometimes would pose as a saleswoman to see what average women thought of her clothes.


== Personal life, retirement, and death ==
Claiborne's first marriage was to Ben Shultz; it ended in divorce in 1954, after she met Arthur Ortenberg. In 1957, she and her now co-worker, Arthur (1926 - 2014) married. She had a son from her first marriage, Alexander G. Shultz, and two stepchildren from her second marriage, Neil Ortenberg and Nancy Ortenberg.Claiborne retired from active management in 1989. By that stage, she had acquired other companies, notably Kayser-Roth, which produced Liz Claiborne accessories. Her husband retired at the same time, leaving the other founders as the active managers.
In retirement, Claiborne and Ortenberg established a foundation that distributed millions in funding to environmental causes, including funding the television series Nature on PBS and nature conservancy projects around the world. She received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design.Claiborne had been advised in May 1997 that she had a rare form of cancer affecting the lining of the abdomen. She died of the cancer on June 26, 2007, at the age of 78.

12,"Jamie Rappaport Clark (born 1957 or 1958) is an American conservationist and former government official working as the president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife. She joined the organization as executive vice president in 2004.


== Early life and education ==
Born in New York city, Clark attended Towson State University, earning a B.S. in wildlife biology in 1979. She received an M.S. in wildlife ecology from the University of Maryland, College Park.


== Career ==
Clark has been a lifelong participant in the conservation of wildlife. As a college student, she spent a summer at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, where she released peregrine falcons back into the wild as part of a national recovery effort. Twenty years later, as the director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, she officially removed them from the federal list of endangered species due to the successful recovery efforts, in which she participated.Clark has a long career in conservation, both inside the government, mostly with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and with non-profit conservation organizations.In recognition of her expertise and achievements in endangered species conservation, President Bill Clinton appointed her as Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) in 1997, a post which she held until 2001. During her tenure as director, Clark established 27 new refuges and added two million acres to the National Wildlife Refuge System. While director, the Service worked with Congress to pass the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvements Act of 1997 Archived June 17, 2015, at the Wayback Machine, establishing wildlife conservation as the main purpose of all refuges. The Service was involved in many successful efforts to recover imperiled wildlife during her tenure, including the bald eagle, gray wolf and the Aleutian Canada goose.As president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, Clark has been at the forefront of endangered species and habitat conservation in the non-profit community. She has been frequently called on to testify on Capitol Hill, providing guidance to members of Congress on conservation issues. Under her tenure, Defenders has played a key role in the reintroduction of bison to tribal reservations, secured protections for right whales, sea turtles and piping plovers and many other species and habitats. Workers at Defenders credit Clark with creating a toxic work environment and a ""culture of fear"" surrounding a 2021 effort to unionize the organization.

== Early life and education ==
Cohen was born to Marshall and Susan Krauthamer, has two younger siblings, and is Jewish. She grew up on the south shore of Long Island in the Baldwin hamlet in Hempstead, New York. Her mother worked as a hospital nurse practitioner in emergency medicine, and inspired her to pursue a medical career.

In 2014, while eight months pregnant, Cohen advocated for maternity coverage in the Affordable Care Act before the United States Congress.


=== Secretary of North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (2017–22) ===
In January 2017 Cohen was appointed Health Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS), an organization with 17,000 employees and an annual budget of $20 billion, by Governor Roy Cooper. As secretary, she oversaw 16,000 department employees and dealt with multiple health crises in North Carolina including the Opioid epidemic, GenX in drinking water, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Cohen was mentioned as a potential pick for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services under President-elect Joe Biden.Cohen navigated the political divide over Medicaid in North Carolina, with Democratic Governor Cooper wanting to expand it under the Affordable Care Act and the Republican-majority North Carolina General Assembly opposing such measures. She helped lead North Carolina through a transition from fee-for-service Medicaid to a model contracted by the state with private insurance companies that are paid pre-determined rates to provide health services. Cohen spearheaded Healthy Opportunities, an initiative testing the impact of providing high-need Medicaid enrollees with housing, food, transportation, and interpersonal safety interventions with the goal of improving public health and reducing costs. The initiative was funded with $650 million from state and federal Medicaid, authorized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She implemented the Opioid Action Plan, which uses $45.5 million in grant funding to fight opioid misuse in the state. The plan also updated the Controlled Substance Reporting System, helping doctors identify patients at risk of misusing opioids. Cohen's plan led to a decline in overdose deaths in North Carolina for the first time in over a decade. She led the Early Childhood Action Plan, focusing on improving health conditions of children from birth to age eight. In 2019 she criticized the North Carolina House of Representatives' proposed budget for 2019–21, arguing that it harmed North Carolinians by making massive cuts to the Department, potentially impacting ""everything from health inspections of restaurants to the safety of drinking water to child protective services.""In February 2019 Modern Healthcare named Cohen as one of the Top 25 Women Leaders in Healthcare. She was honored with the ""Top 50 in Digital Health"" award by Rock Health.  In September 2020, she was awarded the Leadership in Public Health Practice Award by Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In 2020, she was named The News & Observer's Tar Heel of the Year.

In July 2021, she received the Founders Award from the NC Convention of The Delta Kappa Gamma Society. In 2021 she was also elected to the National Academy of Medicine. In March 2022 the American Medical Association (AMA) presented her with the AMA Award for Outstanding Government Service.Governor Cooper announced on November 30, 2021, that Cohen would leave office on January 1, 2022.During and after this time, Cohen is an adjunct professor of health policy & management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health.


==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
Cohen stressed the need for North Carolinians to wear face masks, practice social distancing, and wash their hands in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In March 2020 she sent a letter to the president of the 2020 Republican National Convention, asking for detailed plans on how the convention would operate during the COVID-19 pandemic after President Donald Trump published a series of tweets threatening to pull the convention out of North Carolina. In June 2020 she met virtually with members of the North Carolina House of Representatives' Health Committee to address concerns regarding the pandemic. Cohen announced the creation of up to 300 testing sites in North Carolina, active through July, and requested more supplies from the federal government. She also met with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to discuss the need for more chemical reagents. On June 30, 2020, Cohen announced that her department would partner with Omnicare, a company owned by CVS Health, to administer tests to 36,000 nursing home residents and 25,000 nursing home employees in over 400 locations.In the beginning of July, Cohen warned of people becoming desensitized to the data being collected about COVID-19. She held a media briefing on July 16, 2020, to address virus testing in North Carolina, after the state reached 96,426 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,588 deaths related to the virus. She said that she had concerns about teacher safety if schools were to re-open amidst the pandemic, but was confident in studies showing that the virus has minimal health consequences on younger children, saying that schools ""have not played a significant role in the spreading of COVID-19."" She met with University of North Carolina president William L. Roper to discuss how to resume in-person instruction for students at North Carolina's public colleges and universities. Earlier that month, during a press conference, she had called the virus a ""serious threat"". She warned of the state possibly returning to a stay-at-home order. She had also linked North Carolina's rise in cases with the reopening of the state. Cohen indicated that there would be a test surge in areas with troubling metrics, including the counties of Alamance, Durham, Duplin, Forsyth, Lee, Johnston, Mecklenburg, and Wake.

== Education ==
Cole received her MBA in 2010 from Georgia State University. She had dropped out of her undergraduate engineering program at the University of North Florida to focus on her global career at Hooters, so she had to take the GMAT and extra interviews to apply.

15,"Pamela Colloff is an American journalist. She has contributed to The New Yorker, but a majority of her work has been featured in Texas Monthly, where she was an executive editor. As of 2017, Colloff is a senior reporter at ProPublica and a writer-at-large at The New York Times Magazine.


== Early life ==
Colloff and her brother, David, were raised in Manhattan. Her father, Roger D. Colloff, was vice president and general manager of WCBS-TV in New York City. Her mother, Margery A. Colloff, is counsel to a law firm.Colloff began writing during high school when she was 17 years old. She interviewed Beat poet Allen Ginsberg when he came to her New York City high school. The transcript would later be published in an ""alternative newspaper"" that Colloff and others published their senior year of high school.Because Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, did not offer a journalism degree, Colloff majored in English literature. While at Brown, Colloff completed several independent studies in which she focused on long-form journalism. Some of these stories were published in a now-defunct college magazine and were picked up by the Associated Press.


== Career ==
Colloff moved to Austin, Texas, after college and sought freelancing opportunities. She wrote for Texas Highway Patrol, a local trade magazine, before working for Might magazine and Details. In 1997, Colloff began working for Texas Monthly as a staff writer, and later as an executive editor. As of 2017, Colloff is a senior reporter at ProPublica and a writer-at-large at The New York Times Magazine.


=== Style ===
Many of Colloff's crime stories require extensive research. To understand the trials, she reads through court transcripts; re-interviews witnesses, police, investigators and attorneys; and talks to medical and legal experts to understand the jargon. Colloff tries to keep information as simple as possible so that the audience can easily understand it.Colloff builds suspense and momentum in her stories by revealing information at crucial moments. Knowing that many readers now have short attention spans, Colloff tries to keep the reader engaged by using cliffhangers in her writing. This can be seen in ""The Innocent Man,"" which was broken into two stories published a month apart from each other.


=== ""Innocence Lost"" and ""Innocence Found"" ===
Colloff's two-part story, ""Innocence Lost"" and ""Innocence Found"" are about death row inmate Anthony Charles Graves, who was wrongly convicted in 1992 for the murder of a family in Somerville, Texas. After spending 18 years behind bars, Graves was freed in part due to Colloff's writing.While writing this series, Colloff interviewed the prosecutor among other key witnesses. Colloff noticed discrepancies between the prosecutor's version of events and those presented by the police reports and testimonies in court. She used these inconsistencies in her series to highlight how Graves was wrongly convicted.
Colloff's reporting of Graves' wrongful conviction had lasting consequences. One month after Colloff published ""Innocence Lost,"" the Burleson County district attorney's office dropped all charges against Graves and released him from jail. Many believe Colloff's stories were the persuading factor that helped Graves to win his freedom.


=== ""The Innocent Man"" ===
Colloff's ""The Innocent Man"" is another two-part story she published about a wrongful conviction. In 1986, Michael Morton was convicted for the murder of his wife. After being wrongfully incarcerated for 25 years, Morton received freedom and public recognition of his innocence. ""The Innocent Man"" earned Colloff a nomination for the National Magazine Award that she won.Initially, ""The Innocent Man"" was to be published as one cohesive piece instead of a two-part series. Colloff's editor suggested breaking the story into two parts when the story reached 16,000 words.


=== ""96 Minutes"" ===
In ""96 Minutes"" Colloff collected dozens of quotations from survivors and witnesses of the August 1, 1966, shootings at the University of Texas at Austin. The 2006 story became the inspiration for Keith Maitland's 2016 documentary film Tower.


== Notable work and awards ==
Colloff has been a finalist for the National Magazine Award on multiple occasions and has won once. Below are the pieces that earned Colloff these nominations:
2001: They Haven't Got a Prayer
2011: Innocence Lost and Innocence Found
2013: Hannah and Andrew
2013: The Innocent Man, Part One and The Innocent Man, Part Two: Colloff wins a National Magazine Award for feature writing
2015: The WitnessColloff was also awarded the October Sidney for Investigation in 2010 for her pieces ""Innocence Lost"" and ""Innocence Found."" The award, which was presented by the Sidney Hillman Foundation, was for Colloff's accuracy of reporting a severe injustice.Colloff was also the recipient of the Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism. She was awarded this honor in 2014 for her ""tenacious investigations into wrongful convictions, which have exposed deep flaws in the criminal justice system.""


== Personal life ==
In 2005, Colloff married Chad Davidson Nichols. They had been dating for over 10 years. Together they live in Austin, Texas, with their two children.Colloff is of Jewish descent.

17,"Kellyanne Elizabeth Conway (née Fitzpatrick; born January 20, 1967) is an American political consultant and pollster, who served as Senior Counselor to the President in the administration of Donald Trump from 2017 to 2020. She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016; Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign. She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party, and was formerly president and CEO of the Polling Company/WomanTrend.Conway lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York. In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Conway initially endorsed Ted Cruz and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee. After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager. On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as counselor to the president. On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.After Trump's inauguration, Conway was embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase ""alternative facts"" to describe fictitious and disproven attendance numbers for Trump's inauguration; speaking multiple times of a ""Bowling Green massacre"" that never occurred; and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump. In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for ""unprecedented"" multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939.In August 2020, Conway left the administration. This came after months of a public feud between herself and her teenage daughter, Claudia, who lambasted her in the media, politically and personally, and threatened to seek legal emancipation. In 2022, Conway joined Fox News as a contributor.  She frequently appears as a guest/host on a variety of programs including Hannity, The Five, Outnumbered, The Big Weekend Show and more. Conway also contributed to Fox's 2022 Midterm Election coverage.


== Early life ==
Kellyanne Elizabeth Fitzpatrick was born on January 20, 1967, in the Atco section of Waterford Township, New Jersey, to Diane (née DiNatale) and John Fitzpatrick. Conway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent; John Fitzpatrick owned a small trucking company, and Diane worked at a bank. Conway's parents divorced when she was three, and she was raised by her mother, grandmother, and two unmarried aunts in Atco. She graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985 as class valedictorian.  In high school, she also sang in the choir, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a cheerleader. A 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report identified Conway's grandfather, Jimmy ""The Brute"" DiNatale, as a mob associate of the Philadelphia crime family; DiNatale did not reside with Conway's grandmother, Conway, and the rest of her family. Conway's cousin, Mark DeMarco, has stated that while in high school, Conway ordered members of the football team to stop bullying him; according to DeMarco, the bullying stopped. Her family is Catholic.Conway credits her experience working for eight summers on a blueberry farm in Hammonton, New Jersey, for teaching her a strong work ethic. ""The faster you went, the more money you'd make,"" she said. At age 16, she won the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant. At age 20, she won the World Champion Blueberry Packing competition: ""Everything I learned about life and business started on that farm.""Conway graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C. (now Trinity Washington University), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She earned a Juris Doctor with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1992. After graduation, she served as a judicial clerk for Judge Richard A. Levie of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.


== Early career ==
Conway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm. After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm, but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead. While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University. In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company. Conway's company has consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Conway's clients have included Vaseline, American Express and Hasbro.In the 1990s, Conway, along with other young conservative women Laura Ingraham, Barbara Olson, and Ann Coulter, helped turn punditry into ""stylish stardom"" in both Washington and cable television and credited with setting forth Washington, D.C.'s ""sexual awakening."" In another review of the era in the capital, Conway (then known as Fitzpatrick) put it that her ""broad mind and small waist have not switched places"". Conway, Ingraham, and Coulter were sometimes called ""pundettes"", and appeared on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.Conway worked for Representative Jack Kemp; Senator Fred Thompson; Vice President Dan Quayle; Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; and Representative (later Vice President) Mike Pence. She worked as the senior advisor to Gingrich during his unsuccessful 2012 United States presidential election campaign. Another client in 2012 was U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.
In addition to her political opinion research work, Conway has directed demographic and attitudinal survey projects for trade associations and private companies, including American Express, ABC News, Major League Baseball, and Ladies Home Journal. Her firm The Polling Company also includes WomanTrend, a research and consulting division.Conway has appeared as a commentator on polling and the political scene, having appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY1, and the Fox News Channel, in addition to various radio programs. She received the Washington Post's ""Crystal Ball"" award for accurately predicting the outcome of the 2004 election.Conway has been criticized as a spin doctor of high prominence, particularly in her role as cable TV spokesperson for the Trump Administration. She has been lauded as a ""Trump whisperer."" As part of their long-running feud with Donald Trump, the MSNBC show Morning Joe publicly ""banned"" Conway in February 2017.


== 2016 presidential election ==


=== Ted Cruz support and endorsement ===
When the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years, because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board. Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer. Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as ""extreme"" and ""not a conservative"". On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as ""a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination."" On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying ""Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.""In mid-June 2016, Cruz suspended his campaign and Conway left.


=== Trump campaign ===
On July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign. Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters. On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager. She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign, and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign. Saturday Night Live started satirizing her in October 2016, portrayed by Kate McKinnon. In a January 2017 interview, Conway acknowledged the SNL parody by noting that, ""Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary.""


=== Presidential transition ===

On November 10, 2016, Conway tweeted publicly that Trump had offered her a White House job. ""I can have any job I want"", she said on November 28. On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was ""Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state"" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.On November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump ""was furious"" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments. The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney. CNBC reported on November 28 that senior officials in the Trump transition ""have reportedly been growing frustrated by Conway's failure to become a team player.""On December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign at Harvard Kennedy School for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a ""shouting match""; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist Joel Benenson said ""The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump."" Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: ""Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won.""In early December, Conway claimed that Hillary Clinton supporters were making death threats against her. Consequently, Trump assigned Secret Service to protect her. Conway gave up her Secret Service protection in September 2017 due to ""reduction in threats.""


== White House advisor ==


=== Inauguration fight ===
According to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Trump was sworn in as president. In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.It was not immediately clear what triggered the fistfight and a Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.


=== ""Alternative facts"" ===
During a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase ""alternative facts"" to defend statements made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size. Conway's phrase reminded liberal-leaning commentators of ""Newspeak"", an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.The Guardian noted that ""[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.""


=== Bowling Green massacre ===
On February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the ""Bowling Green massacre"". Such an event never took place. Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Conway stated the next day that she meant to say ""Bowling Green terrorists"", both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq. There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.On February 5, 2017, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. CNN opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were ""serious questions about her credibility.""


=== Ethics violations under the Hatch Act ===
The Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed. Conway has been accused of breaching the act on several occasions:


==== Commercial promotion ====
On February 9, 2017, during an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway discussed department store Nordstrom's decision to drop products supplied by Ivanka Trump's business. ""Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you"", said Conway; she elaborated ""It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online"". Within hours, two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position ""for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise"". Public Citizen asked the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to investigate, saying that Conway's remarks reflected ""an on-going careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the Trump family and Trump Administration"". The group's president, Robert Weissman, declared, ""Since she said it was an advertisement, that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into what's being said, and two, it makes clear that wasn't an inadvertent remark"". Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a similar complaint with the OGE and with the White House Counsel's Office; the group's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, stated ""This seems to us to be about as clear-cut a violation as you can find"".Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times that ""You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,"" adding ""She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family."" Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws, also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, ""If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired"". Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. ""The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business"". At the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing, Sean Spicer told reporters that ""Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we are going to go with ... She's been counseled on the subject, and that's it."" In a direct rebuke to Spicer, Conway tweeted that Trump ""likes 'counselor' more than 'counseled.'""Conway's comments drew bipartisan Congressional condemnation. Chaffetz, a Republican, called them ""clearly over the line"" and ""unacceptable"". Cummings, a Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called them ""jaw-dropping"". Both Chaffetz and Cummings wrote the OGE on February 9, 2017, requesting that Conway's behavior be investigated and that the office recommend ""suggested disciplinary action, if warranted"".


==== Political commentary ====
On November 24, 2017, Walter Shaub, the former director of the OGE, said that he filed an ethics complaint against Conway. He argued that Conway violated the Hatch Act when she criticized Doug Jones, a candidate in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama. On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) – led by Trump appointee Henry Kerner – issued its final report, determining that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews in November and December 2017.Conway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: ""If you’re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts"".On June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, ""by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media"". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kirsten Gillibrand, and also called her violations ""egregious, notorious, and ongoing"". The OSC noted that this was the first time they ""had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual"". In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, ""You know what else is unprecedented? Kellyanne Conway’s behavior.""Due to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to the President for consideration. The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC. Trump said he thought the recommendation was ""very unfair, it's called freedom of speech.""On June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of two Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only two federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with one violation each.


=== Michael Flynn comments and week-long suspension from television ===
On February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn had the president's ""full confidence"". Hours later, Flynn resigned. The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation. It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.Conway came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. ""In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment"", Rubin wrote. Also on February 15 the MSNBC news show Morning Joe officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being ""out of the loop"" and ""in none of the key meetings"". He added ""She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance."" The show's co-host Mika Brzezinski said, ""I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.""For the week following her Flynn comments she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway. Denying the report, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNNMoney that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told CNN journalist Dylan Byers that she would be appearing on Fox News that evening. The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of Hannity during the Conservative Political Action Conference.


=== Oval Office couch photograph ===
Conway came under criticism when she was photographed sitting on an Oval Office couch with her legs folded beneath her – shoes pressed against the upholstery – during President Trump's meeting with leaders from historically black colleges and universities. Some observers suggested the sitting position was a sign of disrespect and a lack of decorum. Body language expert Patti Wood asserted that Conway's posture was not only rude, but ""rather sexual"", and a sign that she ""doesn't have to follow the rules"" because she was ""buddies with Trump."" Conway later addressed the controversy with Lou Dobbs, saying that she was asked to take photographs of the meeting from a certain angle and that she certainly meant ""no disrespect."" She also blamed the media for the ensuing furor.


== Political views ==
Conway views herself as a Generation X conservative. Conway is anti-abortion, saying in 1996: ""We're pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it."" She spoke at the 2017 March for Life, an annual rally protesting abortion and Roe v. Wade.She does not consider herself a feminist ""in a classical sense"", saying that she believes the term is associated with being ""anti-male"" and ""pro-abortion"", but identifies as what she calls an ""individual feminist"". Conway has claimed that many feminists fail to accept women who are pro-life and conservative, and has claimed that they ""'mainly care about what happens from the waist down... It's an insult. You know, it's [from] the waist up for me – my eyes, my ears, my head, my heart, my mouth certainly.'"" She has also claimed that ""nobody cared"" about her experience with sexual harassment and her Me Too moment because of her political views.


== Personal life ==
Conway was married to George Conway, who is of counsel at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and wrote the Supreme Court brief for Paula Jones during the Clinton impeachment in 1998. The couple have four children: twins Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa. Prior to Trump's presidency, they lived in Alpine, New Jersey. Prior to her marriage, Conway dated the senator and 2008 presidential candidate Fred Thompson.George Conway is a critic of Trump; in December 2019 he co-founded the Lincoln Project, which campaigned against Donald Trump's re-election from a conservative perspective. In March 2019, President Trump responded to criticism from Kellyanne's husband George by describing George as a ""stone cold LOSER & husband from hell"". Kellyanne defended Trump by saying that George Conway is ""not a psychiatrist"" and that Trump should not be expected to respond when George, ""a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder"".Conway's daughter Claudia is a TikTok influencer who became known in 2020, at age 15, for her anti-Trump messages. In July 2020 she said that her parents' marriage had ""failed"". Claudia identifies as a leftist and liberal, and described her TikTok fan base as ""leftist, A.C.A.B. (All Cops Are Bastards), anti-trump, blm (Black Lives Matter)"". In August 2020, Claudia Conway announced she was seeking emancipation. In January 2021, she claimed that her mother has been ""physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive,"" posting videos on TikTok appearing to show her mother screaming at and even once hitting her. On January 25, 2021, Kellyanne Conway's official Twitter account shared a topless photo of a girl later confirmed to be Claudia Conway. New Jersey police launched an investigation into the matter. At age 16, Claudia Conway appeared as a contestant on, but was eliminated from, American Idol.In September 2019, Conway's cousin Giovanna Coia, who was then White House press assistant, married Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence, who worked for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign.One of the few White House staffers to have had protection from the Secret Service due to various threats, Conway chose ""Blueberry"" as her Secret Service code name because of associations with the fruit from her youth in pageants and berry picking.In a September 2018 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Conway stated she was the victim of a sexual assault.On August 23, 2020, Conway announced her resignation in order to ""spend more time with her family,"" as did her husband George, who announced he had taken time off from the Lincoln Project and Twitter.In October 2020, Conway's daughter, Claudia, revealed on social media that her mother had tested positive for COVID-19.In March 2023, George and Kellyanne announced that they were divorcing after 22 years of marriage.

30,"Morgan DeBaun (born 1990) is an African American serial entrepreneur and corporate advisor. She is the Founder and CEO of Blavity Inc., the leading digital media company for Black culture and millennials.


== Early life and education ==
DeBaun was born in St. Louis, Missouri. While living in a predominantly white suburban neighborhood, her family surrounded her with positive black role models. They sent her to a magnet school in the city so she could be around more children like herself.DeBaun showed an interest in business at an early age. She sold sugary snacks to her fellow students in their middle school that lacked vending machines, and she learned about investing from her father at age 14.She came up with the idea of Blavity Inc. while attending Washington University in St. Louis. Black students there would sit together at lunch and talk for hours. She referred to this gathering of African-American students as Black Gravity, or Blavity.


== Career ==
DeBaun began her career working on product management and business development at Intuit. She kept her full time job at Intuit but was spending all her nights and weekends working on Blavity. She ultimately left Intuit and committed to Blavity full time due to her dissatisfaction with the media coverage of Michael Brown's death.DeBaun cofounded Blavity with Aaron Samuels and Jeff Nelson in 2014. They started with a curated video newsletter and built a website, which was only the beginning.

35,"Sue Desmond-Hellmann is an American oncologist and biotechnology leader who served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation from 2014 to 2020. She was previously Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the first woman to hold the position, and Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professor, and before that president of product development at Genentech, where she played a role in the development of the first gene-targeted cancer drugs, Avastin and Herceptin.


== Early life and education ==
Desmond-Hellmann grew up in Reno, Nevada, as one of seven children. Her father worked as a pharmacist and her mother was an English teacher. She earned a bachelor of science degree in pre-medicine and an M.D. from the University of Nevada, Reno and received her residency training at UCSF, where she served as chief resident. She is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology, and also holds a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.


== Career ==


=== Beginnings ===
Desmond-Hellmann served as an associate adjunct professor of epidemiology and biostatistics At UCSF. She joined the UCSF medical faculty during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, and worked on Kaposi's sarcoma. Beginning in 1989 both she and her husband, an infectious disease doctor, spent two years as visiting faculty at the Uganda Cancer Institute, studying and treating patients with infectious diseases and Kaposi's sarcoma in a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. She then spent two years in private practice.
Returning to clinical research, Desmond-Hellmann became associate director of clinical cancer research at Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. While there, she was the project team leader for Taxol.
In 1995 Desmond-Hellmann joined Genentech as a clinical scientist. She was named chief medical officer the following year, and in 1999 became executive vice president of development and product operations. From March 2004 through April 2009 she was president of product development, playing a role in the development of two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin. She left after the company was acquired by Roche Pharmaceuticals. At that point her compensation was $8 million a year.From 2005 to 2008, Desmond-Hellmann served a three-year term as a member of the American Association for Cancer Research board of directors, and from 2001 to 2009, she served on the executive committee of the board of directors of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. She also served a three-year term on the Economic Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco beginning in January 2009. She served on the corporate board of Affymetrix from 2004 to 2009 and on the board of Procter & Gamble in 2012–13,


=== Chancellor of UCSF, 2009–2013 ===
After being invited to apply, on August 3, 2009, Desmond-Hellmann became the ninth Chancellor of UCSF, and the first woman to hold the position. Desmond-Hellmann became the first Chancellor drawn from outside academia. Her starting salary was $450,000 a year.In June 2010, one day after being questioned by The New York Times, Desmond-Hellmann sold her stock in the Altria Group, which owns Phillip Morris USA and other tobacco companies, and subsequently donated $134,000 to the tobacco control center at UCSF. She said that many of her holdings had been purchased on her behalf by her stockbroker and that she was too busy to oversee all her investments,  although she had included the stock on her financial disclosure statement.In January 2012 Desmond-Hellmann proposed changing the relationship between UCSF, a health sciences university, and the University of California. She proposed creating partnerships between UCSF and private pharmaceutical corporations and other sources of funding, in order to increase its revenues and resolve its projected financial instability.Desmond-Hellmann served as UCSF Chancellor until March 2014, holding the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professorship during her tenure.


=== Precision medicine network ===
In 2011, Desmond-Hellmann co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that recommended creating a Google Maps-like data network aimed at developing more diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual patients — a concept known as precision medicine. The so-called ""knowledge network"" would integrate the wealth of data emerging on the molecular basis of disease with information on environmental factors and patients’ electronic medical records and would allow scientists to share emerging research findings faster, thereby accelerating the development of tailored treatments. It also would allow clinicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, reduce health care costs and ultimately improve care. The NAS report, titled ""Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease"", was described by Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCSF, as ""the most important National Academy of Sciences Framework Analysis since that advisory body recommended that the United States go forward with the Human Genome Project"".


=== CEO of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2014–2020 ===
On December 17, 2013, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it had selected Desmond-Hellmann as its next chief executive officer. She assumed her role on May 1, 2014, the first head of the foundation to be neither a former Microsoft executive nor a personal friend of the Gates', and the first physician.In 2017 Desmond-Hellmann became a member of the Prix Galien USA Committee, succeeding Roy Vagelos as Chair of that Committee in 2018. She is also Chair of the Prix Galien International and Member of the Prix Galien Africa Committee.
In December 2019, Desmond-Hellmann announced plans to step down from her role as BMGF CEO ""for health and family reasons"". Mark Suzman will leave his role of BMGF president of Global Policy & Advocacy and chief strategy officer to become the new BMGF CEO on February 1, 2020.

Dew has also been a religious leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and an inspirational speaker. In 2003, she was described as “the most prominent single [unmarried] LDS woman right now.”Deseret Book Company owns two retail chains (Deseret Book and Seagull), two publishing companies (Deseret Book and Covenant), an events division (Time Out for Women), a digital division, a magazine (LDS Living) and a film-distribution company (Excel).


== Personal life ==
Dew was born November 21, 1953, in Ulysses, Kansas, to Charles and JoAnn Peterson Dew. The oldest of five children, she grew up on a ""sprawling grain farm"" and attended local schools. Of this time, she has said:

I drove a tractor almost as soon as I could reach the pedals. I know how to set an irrigation tube, and I helped with the harvest. . . . On the farm you learn early that you reap what you sow. . . .  I am innately very shy, and I have struggled with that challenge for years. My work has helped because I’ve had to interview people from all walks of life.
Dew told interviewers in 2002 and 2004 that as a teenager she was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and was a standout in high school basketball, averaging 23 points and 17 rebounds a game. A Bloomberg Businessweek reporter wrote in 2012 that Dew had the ""friendly, no-nonsense manner"" of a high school basketball coach."" Another writer noted in 2010 that Dew's ""confident and collected demeanor always kept her on task.""She learned the piano and traveled on three USO tours to Alaska, Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia as an accompanist during her college years at Brigham Young University (BYU), where she earned a bachelor's degree in history, with an emphasis in American religious history.Dew is close friends with Wendy Watson Nelson, and they presented together at the 2016 RootsTech conference.


== Career ==


=== Beginning ===
After graduating from BYU, Dew moved into the publishing business associated with the LDS Church, starting out as an assistant editor at Bookcraft beginning in 1978.  She spent the next six years as an editor and associate publisher at This People magazine.


=== Deseret Book ===
Dew joined Deseret Book in 1988 as an associate editor and became director of publishing in 1989, vice president of publishing in 1993, and executive vice president in 2000. She was named the president and CEO of the company in March 2002, succeeding Ronald A. Millett. At the time Deseret Book consisted of a retail chain of some 40 stores and a publishing division. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2012 that Deseret Book was a ""flailing"" business when Dew took it over but that she ""pulled the publisher and distributor out of the red 10 years ago.""In 2002 the company launched its Time Out for Women event series, and in 2004 it acquired Excel Entertainment, which brought Deseret Book into film distribution. Some of Excel's films include Saints and Soldiers, Forever Strong, The Work and the Glory, 17 Miracles and Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed.In 2006, Deseret Book acquired the Seagull retail chain of twenty-six bookstores and Covenant Publishing, which publishes and distributes books, games, and gifts.In June 2011, the company introduced Deseret Bookshelf, a free e-reader application for Apple and Android mobile devices, with nearly 1,500 digital titles for purchase. On a personal level, Dew noted that the Bookshelf app had ""changed the way I research and study the gospel"" because ""I can always have my full library with me."" The app allows the researcher to search all Deseret Book titles at one time as well as other associated Gospel references.


=== Broadcasting ===
Dew is a director of the Bonneville International Corporation, a broadcasting organization owned by the LDS Church.


== Public activities ==


=== Politics, government, and charity ===
Dew is a member of both the BYU Marriott School of Management’s National Advisory Council and the President’s Leadership Council for BYU-Hawaii. In March 2003, the White House appointed her a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls at the United Nations.After a 1999 trip to Ghana, Dew began to spearhead Chapters of Hope, a program to send children’s books to impoverished areas of the world. Through 2011, nearly 50,000 books had been shipped to Ghana, the Pacific Islands, Russia, Eastern Europe, Zimbabwe and elsewhere by that organization.Dew has said she has a greater liking for Republican political positions, particularly on social issues, explaining that ""I am a Midwestern farmer's daughter,"" but that she has ""many, many times"" voted for Democrats. She has been asked to run for political office, but said she is so shy she ""can't even ask for the full can of apple juice on the airplane"" so she couldn't very well ask for votes.Dew opened the 2004 Republican National Convention with a prayer after, she said, she had received a telephone request from ""out of the blue and after she ""had to ask myself if this would appear too partisan, and I decided it was never inappropriate to pray."" She said she thought it ""remarkable"" that an LDS Church member was invited for the honor, ""and even more so a woman.""


=== LDS Church ===
Dew was a counselor to Mary Ellen W. Smoot in the general presidency of the women’s Relief Society from 1997 to 2002, the first unmarried woman called to this position.As an author, Dew was the authorized biographer for three church presidents: Ezra Taft Benson, Gordon B. Hinckley, and Russell M. Nelson.
Since 2009, Dew has contributed to the Mormon Channel's Conversations program, where she has interviewed some high-profile members of the LDS Church.


=== Cancer survivor ===
In 2006, Dew was diagnosed with breast cancer, revealed as ""three tiny spots, almost invisible to the naked eye,"" and since 2010 she has been active in promoting awareness of the disease among Utah women. ""I'm actually a poster child for early diagnosis,"" Dew said.


=== Same-sex marriage ===

Dew ""drew criticism"" resulting from remarks she made on February 28, 2004, at a Washington, D.C., meeting of the Family Action Council International, an interfaith group. According to Lee Davidson, a Deseret News reporter who was present, Dew quoted a statement by journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1941:

saying that before World War II would be over, every person would either stand for or against [German dictator Adolf] Hitler—and that trying not to make any choice was in fact making one, for Hitler.Dew said in calm tones that the same is true in the fight for the traditional family, and everyone will support or fight it. ""If we do not act in behalf of the family, that is itself an act of opposition to the family,"" she said.
Dew did add, ""At first it may be extreme to imply a comparison between the atrocities of Hitler and what is happening in terms of contemporary threats against the family—but maybe not,"" and added she feels that breaking up the family will break up society.
The next month the Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons organization, which is not officially affiliated with the LDS Church, issued a statement expressing “outrage” at Dew's remarks, and in September of the same year the president of the Human Rights Campaign and the strategic director of the National Black Justice Coalition called on President George W. Bush to repudiate Dew's “deeply offensive comments about LGBT Americans.”In April 2005, Dew said that her point had nothing to do with Hitler. “I wasn't comparing anybody to Hitler,” she said. “Hitler is irrelevant to the point I was trying to make.”
“I have friends living an openly gay lifestyle with kids,” she added. “In every instance, they are caring parents who love their kids and their kids love them. They know I feel it's not my prerogative to judge them. It's their right to choose. ... Those that deal with same-sex attraction have my respect.”

At the time of her appointment, Donigan was one of 36 women to serve at CEO of a Fortune 500 company, a record at the time. In 2019, Fortune listed her among ""powerful women on your radar."" Prior to her tenure, Rite Aid had lost market share to competitors CVS and Walgreens, and carried significant debt. Given the financial status of the company, some industry analysts were concerned hiring Donigan was an example of the ""glass cliff."" While Donigan lacked retail experience, she had previously navigated debt refinancing as a board member at Kindred Healthcare. Donigan planned to focus on fewer markets where the brand still was competitive, and expand the services provided by in-store pharmacists, a strategy supported by industry analysts. However, Donigan's plans were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Donigan spoke at a press conference with President Donald Trump to speak about Rite Aid's commitment to COVID-19 testing. Due in part to the pandemic, Donigan's tenure included a move toward remote work for Rite Aid corporate employees, as well as an expansion of digital delivery systems for pharmacy customers. In 2022, Donigan received a Distinguished Leadership Award from The Conference Board for service during challenging times.During her time at Rite Aid, Donigan closed more than 150 unprofitable stores. Donigan was credited with avoiding the bankruptcy for Rite Aid by pushing debt payments due in 2022 to 2025; however, Deutsche Bank warned the company was in danger of a ""dramatic negative inflection point"" in April 2022. Other analysts were less skeptical of Donigan's plans; however, recovery for the company was expected to ""take time and likely be bumpy."" In 2022, Rite Aid widened its annual loss forecast three quarters in a row, resulting in a 48-year low stock price. In January 2023, Rite Aid announced Donigan was leaving the company.

Donigan is a native of Greenwich, Connecticut. She is the daughter of the Episcopal priest and Tolkien scholar Fleming Rutledge.

Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988. By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.


=== The Dragas Companies ===
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases. Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009. It is now the region's largest homebuilder, with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty. In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.  Helen Dragas was named  Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen. She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.


=== Other positions ===
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy. Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and  has served on their audit committee. She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.


== UVA Board of Visitors ==


=== First term ===
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.  She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011, and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing ""philosophical differences"" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president. After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions, but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation. A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start. Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons. Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector. Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas. A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was ""cordial,"" but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas. As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members. At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president. While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation, she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell, and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.


=== Reconfirmation ===
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position. [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.” The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."" Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report. In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.


=== End of tenure ===
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change. In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, ""I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."" Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013, though she remains a member of the board.In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt. The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years. Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.” Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition. Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid. Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases, following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia.""


=== Advocacy on Affordability ===
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.  Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition. In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University. A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions. Charlottesville’s newspaper, The Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.” Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, The Daily Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.


== Personal life ==
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.

52,"Nina Dudnik is an American social entrepreneur, science diplomacy advocate, and the Founder and former CEO of Seeding Labs, a US-based nonprofit organization investing in building scientific capacity in the developing world. Dudnik founded the organization in 2003 as a graduate student studying at Harvard University, where she received her PhD in molecular biology.


== Education and early career ==
Dudnik received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry from Brown University. Between college and graduate school, she worked in agricultural development as a consultant for CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) in Italy, and then became a Fulbright scholar in Cote d’Ivoire. After her year in Africa, she returned to the United States to attend Harvard University, where she received her PhD in molecular biology. She did her doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Kami Ahmad, where she ultimately published her dissertation, ""Histone dimers on the move: Nucleosome assembly systems for H2A and H2AV in Drosophila.""


== Global development work ==
Dudnik had personally felt the effects of lack of access to scientific resources in developing countries when doing her Fulbright work in Côte d'Ivoire, where she was working to breed better varieties of rice. There, she saw a gap between a wealth of scientific talent and a dearth of access to research equipment to put that talent to use. When she returned to the United States to pursue her doctoral degree, she worked to bridge that gap. She led a group of fellow students in collecting surplus biological equipment and supplies at Harvard University to send to labs in developing countries to support the research they were doing at their local institutions. This effort became the basis of Seeding Labs, which formally launched in 2007 when Dudnik was awarded the Echoing Green fellowship. A year later, Seeding Labs was established as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2008.Dudnik and her team  expanded Seeding Labs beyond equipment transfer, developing exchange programs to train scientists from developing countries in America. She  promoted the organization's vision as a TEDGlobal Fellow, a PopTech Social Innovation Fellow, and at the World Economic Forum. They have received funding and support from a combination of government organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, academic institutions like Harvard University, and multinational corporations like Merck.


== Science advocacy efforts ==
Dudnik has written on the need to build scientific capacity in developing countries to take on the world's most pressing health challenges for outlets like Scientific American, Time, and Quartz, drawing attention to the lack of funding and research support for countries in the global South. After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, she published an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal underscoring the need to support developing scientific talent within Africa, which could have enabled earlier public health mobilization on the ground and prevented a wider Ebola outbreak without reliance on Western aid.A woman in science herself, Dudnik has also written on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields. She is currently an Advisory Board member for the grassroots nonprofit 500 Women Scientists, which is working to make science open, inclusive, and accessible by promoting women scientists in leadership.

53,"Eliza Patricia Dushku (; born December 30, 1980) is an American actress. She is best known for starring as Faith in the supernatural drama series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1998–2003) and its spin-off series Angel (2000–2003). She also had lead roles in the Fox supernatural drama series Tru Calling (2003–2005) and the Fox science fiction series Dollhouse (2009–2010), for which she was a producer.Dushku had starring roles in various films, including True Lies (1994), Bye Bye Love (1995), Bring It On (2000), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), The New Guy (2002), Wrong Turn (2003), On Broadway (2007), The Scribbler (2014), Jane Wants a Boyfriend (2015), and Eloise (2016). She has also done voice work for numerous video games and animated films.


== Early life ==
Dushku was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, the only daughter and youngest of the four children of school teacher and administrator Philip Richard George Dushku and Judy Dushku (née Rasmussen), a political science professor. Dushku's father was Boston-born, of Albanian heritage, with his parents coming from the city of Korçë, and her mother, from Idaho, is of Danish, English, Irish and German descent. Her parents were divorced before she was born.Dushku's mother was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Dushku and her three brothers were raised as members of the Church. She attended Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and graduated from Watertown High School.


== Career ==


=== Acting ===


==== 1992–1997: Beginnings and breakthrough ====
Dushku came to the attention of casting agents when she was ten years old. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the 1992 romantic drama film That Night. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl, alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, in the drama film This Boy's Life. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in the action spy film True Lies.She had roles as Piper Reeves in the short film Fishing with George (1994), as Cat in the television film Journey (1995), as Paul Reiser's daughter in the romantic comedy film Bye Bye Love (1995), and as Cindy Johnson in the comedy drama film Race the Sun (1996).


==== 1998–2002: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and recognition ====
Dushku planned to attend Suffolk University in Boston, where her mother taught, but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a television show starring another of his clients, Sarah Michelle Gellar. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire's to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part of Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When she began her work on the series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of the show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku. Though initially planned as a three-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four and for the last five episodes of the series. She also appeared in the spin-off series Angel.As an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from prisoners. She said:

I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting things that you don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures – ""Oh, here's a picture of me before I was incarcerated!"" – and there's some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a mustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy. Way more creepy than Buffy.
In 2000, Dushku starred in the hit cheerleader comedy Bring It On. She followed that up with Soul Survivors, which reunited her with her Race the Sun co-star Casey Affleck. In 2001, she appeared in The New Guy with DJ Qualls and in City by the Sea with Robert De Niro and James Franco. The latter film garnered attention from a wider adult audience and several good reviews. The same year, Kevin Smith invited Dushku to be a part of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.


==== 2003–2008: Tru Calling and subsequent roles ====
In 2003, Dushku starred in the horror film Wrong Turn and The Kiss, an independent comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, Tru Calling, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant withdrawn, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue, where she discovers her power to ""re-live"" the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer about Faith.
She has had many roles as a ""bad girl"" in films. In an interview with Maxim in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, ""It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting.""Dushku starred in the Off-Broadway play Dog Sees God in December 2005. The play was based on the Peanuts comic strip, with Dushku playing a character symbolizing Lucy Van Pelt.

==== 2009–present: Dollhouse and other work ====
On August 26, 2007, Dushku signed a development deal with Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox.

Dushku produced the show and played the main character, 'Echo'. It aired on Fox during the 2008–09 TV season. In an interview, Dushku talked about how Dollhouse and her reconnection with Whedon came about:

I invited Joss Whedon to lunch after I did the business deal with Fox. We'd had a cool relationship in the past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was a little bit of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.
Dushku described Whedon as ""my favorite genius ... favorite friend ... big brother ... and the only person out here I've ever wholeheartedly trusted, because he's never let me down."" Dollhouse was renewed for a second season. The producers cited their confidence in the strength of Whedon's fan base and high DVR numbers as their reasons for keeping the show. Fox cancelled Dollhouse on November 11, 2009. The show officially wrapped filming on the second and final season on December 16, 2009.

Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Korçë. She and her brother Nate produced a film about a joint visit to Albania, Dear Albania.


=== Sexual molestation and harassment allegations ===
In January 2018, Dushku made public an account of having been molested by stunt coordinator Joel Kramer when she was 12 and working on True Lies.

Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct.In January 2019, CBS made a $9.5 million settlement with Dushku after she was fired from a recurring role on Bull, after informing producers of series lead Michael Weatherly's alleged inappropriate behavior on the set. According to documents from the official mediation, Weatherly was recorded on video making comments about spanking Dushku over his knee, soliciting a threesome, alluding to sexual assault in his ""rape van,"" and other inappropriate jokes. After Dushku spoke with producers, Weatherly texted CBS Television Studios' president David Stapf saying he wanted to talk about Dushku's sense of humor, though Stapf pushed back saying ""Ms. Dushku made the show better."" Days later, showrunner Glenn Caron terminated Dushku's expected role on the show, despite opposition from studio executives. The settlement amount was calculated to compensate Dushku for her loss of earnings from her planned promotion to series regular, with ""well-developed plans"" set to make her a regular cast member following her three-episode guest appearance. In December 2018, when the settlement was reported, Weatherly publicly apologized for the comments.

55,"Ellie Dylan (born Elinor Angel Helman September 8, 1952) is the president and founder of The Skyshapers Foundation (dba Skyshapers University) and the CEO, president and founder of SKY U, LLC.
Dylan began her career in radio as a college disc jockey and rose to become ""the most listened to female disc jockey in the United States"" on NBC Radio: Dylan took her 7:00pm-to-midnight time shift on WMAQ from 17th place in the ratings to the number-one rated show in Chicago, and then became the first woman to do an afternoon drive shift on AM radio in a major market. She went on to become the first woman to hold a morning drive time position on AM radio in a major market when she replaced Don Imus at WNBC in New York City in 1977.Dylan next moved to television as the host and producer of “You!,” a weekly television series on WABC-TV in New York City. Her program grew into a solid ratings success following Dylan's initial telecast, which was nominated for three Emmy Awards. Her “You!” show went on to win an Emmy Award and became number one in the ratings.Dylan later established Skyshapers University and Sky U to develop and produce multimedia programs to motivate elementary school-age children to excel. More than 7.5 million children and more than 10,000 schools across America have participated in Skyshapers University programs.Subsequently, Dylan produced and co-directed the feature documentary, On Our Own Island, which received many accolades and screened at film festivals around the world.


== Early life ==
Ellie Dylan was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but spent her formative years in Columbus, Georgia. She later explained that growing up in the Deep South during the Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on her life.Dylan left Georgia to attend Tulane University in New Orleans and spent her junior year abroad at the University of London. Returning to New Orleans, Dylan graduated with honors, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude, from Tulane and was accepted by Tulane's Law School.Dylan relates that during those college years, she experienced two life-changing events which shaped her future. The first occurred when her freshman English professor gave Dylan an “F” on a major paper she had written, explaining that she would continue to fail Dylan until she worked at her full potential. (This professor later bestowed the honor of Phi Beta Kappa on Dylan upon her graduation in the top percentile of her class at Tulane in 1974.)
During her college years, Dylan was also a disc jockey on WTUL, the Tulane campus radio station, where she played music from The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, etc. and began to discover the power of the media to create change.
Dylan relates that her passion for radio became such that on every college vacation she attempted to get a job at a “real radio station” in her hometown, only to be told time after time “Women are not on the radio.”
Finally, the summer before she was to begin law school, Dylan was hired to do radio shows on WWRH and WPNX in her hometown.  There she posed pointed questions to the likes of David Duke, Grand Dragon of the KKK, and Lester Maddox, controversial Georgia Governor, who is reported to have walked off her show. Thereafter, a local radio station employee told Dylan “You’ll never make it in radio. Because you’re different.”Soon after, Dylan heard about a nationwide talent search for ‘The Queen of Country Music’ from WMAQ Radio (the NBC-owned Chicago radio station, which covers 38 states and Canada). Dylan sent in a three-minute biographical tape backed by Earl Scruggs banjo picking. Again, Dylan was “different” and won the talent search.


== Career ==


=== Radio (1975-78) ===
In 1975, Dylan moved to Chicago and accepted the job as ""The Queen of Country Music"" at WMAQ, a hefty salary, and a new surname (after her favorite musician, Bob Dylan).  By June of that year, Dylan was on the cover of the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine, which called her ""82 pounds and 50,000 watts of down-home disc jockey."" In her two years at WMAQ, Dylan turned her 7:00pm-to-midnight shift into the number-one rated music show in Chicago.  She then became the first woman to do an afternoon drive shift on AM radio in a major market, and doubled the ratings in the 3-7pm slot.In September 1977, Dylan joined WNBC, NBC's flagship radio station in New York, as the first woman to hold a morning drive time shift on AM radio in a major market.  There she replaced Don Imus. Although Imus had a loyal following, Dylan in her first rating book increased WNBC's morning audience, and became the most listened-to female disc jockey in the United States.  But the success at WNBC did not last though, as the station's switch to a more streamlined format was short-lived; and Ellie was gone from WNBC within a few months.


=== Television (1978-85) ===
But Dylan itched to broaden her horizons and set her sights on television, explaining that she wanted to “create a kind of ‘reality show’ that is honest, clear, and alive.”On Saturday, September 30, 1978, Ellie Dylan’s You! show premiered on WABC-TV in New York and was subsequently nominated for three Emmy Awards. Called “one of the best rating increase stories ever” by WABC-TV, in February 1979, Ellie Dylan's You! show became number one in the ratings and “the hottest show in New York television” and won an Emmy Award.By 1980, Dylan also began hosting and producing a series of one-hour Ellie Dylan Specials in her first departure from the You! format.  Stints on other television programs followed: Kids are People Too, The Love Report and later, The Today Show.


=== Multimedia Education (1985-2020) ===
Drawing from her past when she was discouraged from becoming a radio disc jockey and then a television host/producer, only to succeed at both, Dylan next set her sights on developing entertainment to motivate children.In 1986, Dylan started Skyshapers, Inc., a company to produce motivational entertainment products and programs for children.  By August 1988, Dylan had also formed a 501(c)(3) public charity, the Skyshapers Foundation to develop and distribute children's motivational programs and scholarships.  Along with creating 22 original cartoon characters and an original rock music soundtrack, Dylan put together an advisory board and forged alliances with the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a program that would motivate children by giving them “action steps” to reach their dreams.


=== Government Partnerships ===
After seven years of market research and focus groups with children, the Skyshapers Foundation program was endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General, Antonia Novello. It was federally funded and distributed in 20 percent of the elementary schools in the U.S., reaching more than 10,000 schools and 7.5 million children. It became one of the largest programs of its kind the Public Health Service has ever run in American schools.In excess of 14 million pieces of Skyshapers materials were distributed to fulfill orders from 10,000 public and private elementary schools, and thousands of Boys' and Girls' Clubs, Scout troops, and church- and synagogue-affiliated youth groups in the United States.  Inspired by the successful response to the Skyshapers Program, Dylan and her team began developing Skyshapers textbooks and teacher editions; the first of which was the Sky Quest series.
In 1999, Skyshapers became an official vendor for textbooks and teachers' editions for the New York City Board of Education, and Dylan began developing and delivering programs for the New York City school system, the largest in America with over 1 million students in more than 1,400 schools. In 2003, Dylan started Sky U, L.L.C., to serve as the production entity for the marketing and distribution of Skyshapers University products and programs.


=== Quest For Excellence ===
In 2005, Dylan began The SKY U Quest For Excellence initiative in NYC schools, with Sky U and Skyshapers University producing and delivering SKY U Quest For Excellence Live Events for students, Faculty Training Seminars, SKY U Tracker Organizer Systems, SKY U Activity Sets, SKY U Incentive Cards, and Leaders’ Curriculum Sets.SKYSHAPERS University programs are noted for their colorful cartoon characters and “hip,” positive approach. They employ an intergalactic space theme with upbeat, contemporary music and child-friendly language. As Dylan puts it, “I realized that after ‘Sesame Street’ and ‘Mr. Rogers,’ there is really nothing for the next age group that entertains yet educates. There is truly a void in hip, solid entertainment with a positive lifestyle message...that gives children action steps, rather than a slogan, to achieve excellence and reach their dreams.”


=== Documentary filmmaking (2014 - Present) ===
In 2022, Dylan completed and premiered the feature documentary, On Our Own Island, a timeless true love story that chronicles the seasons of a relationship from its romantic beginnings through life’s final moments. On Our Own Island, described as “vivid, lyrical, and loving,” was produced by Dylan to mitigate society’s fear of death while illustrating that unconditional love is the most important thing of all. Dylan co-directed the film with her daughter, Sky Dylan-Robbins, also a filmmaker and journalist. The film was inspired by and dedicated to Dylan’s husband of 33 years and Sky’s father, Steven Robbins, who died in February 2016. On Our Own Island has won numerous awards and screened at film festivals in the United States and around the world.

== Early years ==
Engel is the daughter of actor Roy Engel. She attended John Marshall High School and graduated from California State College at Los Angeles. After her college graduation, Engel worked for the Los Angeles City Parks Department. In 1963, Engle was parade marshal for the San Fernando Valley Rodeo.


== Career ==
Engel's father's connections were assets during her time as an actress and a singer. She said that he ""knew everyone in Los Angeles and everyone owed him at least one favor and I collected them all."" His connections and her lyric soprano voice helped her to sing lead for national performing companies, and she performed on film, in nightclubs, and on television.Her work as an entertainer took her into trade shows when she was selected to be featured at events with titles that included Queen of the 4th International Sports, Vacation and Travel Show in 1963. She also worked as a narrator and demonstrator at a trade show in San Francisco. She talked to people behind the scenes at such events and began to notice that some of the ideas she suggested were being implemented.That realization led to her using a spare bedroom in her Glendale home to start her own business, a one-woman operation whose work won several prizes for clients for having the best exhibits in their trade shows. Her efforts received a boost when some men in New York provided ""$2,000, an office and a phone and said 'See what you can do'"".Engel founded Stratagem Enterprises Inc., a company that produces trade shows and industrial exhibits. As president of the company, in 1975, she headed a staff of 22 people. With offices in New York and San Francisco, in the early 1970s the company was grossing more than $1 million a year. Its clients included ALCOA, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. Stratagem's approach is to provide a complete package to represent a product at a trade show. After she sees a product, her company designs and builds the exhibit, scripts a demonstration, and operates a hospitality suite. It also produces films for the demonstrations if they are needed.Engel compares her trade-show work to show business, with the difference being that the former sells an act, while the latter sells a product.

On 8 June 2023, Erkan became the governor by a presidential decree by Erdoğan, becoming the first female head of the Turkish Central Bank.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed Erkan as the new central bank governor on June 8, 2023, replacing Sahap Kavcioglu who served as governor since March 20, 2021. Under her leadership, the central bank turned away from Erdogan's imposition of low interest rates that had caused soaring inflation and turned away foreign investors in favor of increasing the rates to 45% from the previous 8.5%, which the bank said had stopped inflation by January 2024.In late 2023 Erkan told a local newspaper that she and her family had been unable to afford a house in Istanbul, so had moved in with her parents. Many opposition politicians called her statement a ""lie"", claiming that she had a million-dollar fortune from her career in the U.S. and that her income as governor was more than 20 times the minimum wage at the time. On 2 February, Erkan announced her resignation from the central bank following an article published in the newspaper Sözcü that said one of the bank's employees had been fired at the instigation of Erkan's father. Erkan called the report ""a major reputation assassination campaign"". The following day, she was removed from office by the President and replaced by then Deputy Governor Fatih Karahan.

70,"Susan M. Estes (born 1959) is an American business executive and CEO of OpenDoor Securities, a firm that primarily traded in United States Treasury securities. Along with Brian Meehan, she co-founded the company in 2013, becoming the first woman to own and operate a bond trading business, an historically male-dominated industry. The company provided anonymous electronic Treasury trading. OpenDoors Securities ceased operations on January 13, 2021.


== Background ==
Estes grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. She studied at the University of Redlands in California, earning a bachelor's degree. In 1985, she joined Morgan Stanley as a junior trader, specializing in U.S. Treasury and global bond trading. In 1999, she was promoted at age 40 to managing director of Morgan Stanley's government bond trading group, overcoming sexism in the process. According to The Wall Street Journal, her group represented approximately 5% of the firm's revenue at the time.In 2002, Estes left Morgan Stanley to became head of North America Securities for Deutsche Bank in New York. A year later, she relocated to Los Angeles to be managing director of Countrywide Securities Corporation. Estes later explained in an interview: “Back then, the Treasury market was more volatile, moving 50 basis points at the time. Countrywide was the largest mortgage originator, and they hired me to build a domestic dealership, which was the first new dealer in more than 50 years"".


== Founding of OpenDoor Securities ==
In August 2013, Estes and Brian Meehan founded OpenDoor Securities, becoming the first woman to own and manage a bond trading firm. The company markets its integrated buy-side into an anonymous platform that enhances the sourcing and creation of liquidity, employing various trading methods and traditional intermediaries for U.S. Treasuries. 
Headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, the company's clients include pension and hedge funds, primary dealers, and trading firms. The overall value of the U.S. Treasury market exceeds $17 trillion as of 2024.By 2015, the trend in bond trading was moving away from the big investment banks or primary dealers, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, towards mutual funds and electronic-trading specialists, such as OpenDoor. In November of that year, Estes attended a conference at the Federal Reserve in New York City, where the changing market for Treasuries was discussed. In contrast to past such conferences where the primary dealers were predominant, Estes said following the 2015 meeting, ""The dynamics are shifting, primary dealers are being pushed out"".In 2019, the industry faced the challenge of a $40 billion reduction in bank funding for Treasuries trading. Estes told Bloomberg News that whereas she could readily facilitate a $4 billion spread for trades in U.S. Treasuries while with Deutsche Bank in 2002, the investment banks were much less willing to take on risks of that magnitude in 2019. To get the same rate, ""clients today could only pull off $250 million"", she said. By 2020, trading levels had dropped in bonds and affected U.S. Treasuries to such an extent that Estes was quoted by The Wall Street Journal as calling the situation ""chaos"". To address the industry-wide problem of persistent illiquidity with U.S. Treasuries trading, Estes' company developed a new approach in 2020, going beyond session-based transactions for ""off-the-run Treasuries"" (OFTRs) to an ""all-to-all"" continuous order book for the government bond market. Such off-the-run Treasuries (OFTRs) constitute 32% of daily trading volume in U.S. Treasuries. OpenDoors Securities ceased operations on January 13, 2021.Estes has served on the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), the first woman to do so, under U.S. Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and John W. Snow, when the TBAC addressed market issues with the Federal Reserve under Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.


== Awards ==
Estes won the ""Excellence in Treasury Trading Award"" in 2019, one of the Women in Finance Awards bestowed by Markets Media. Commenting on the lack of women in the American finance sector, Estes said, ""The lack of gender diversity in the finance and technology workforce is not a secret. Women that I know who have excelled in this predominantly male environment come from very diverse backgrounds but are bound together by one common element: They each love what they do"".She was also awarded an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, the University of Redlands.

81,"Nikki Jean Finke (December 16, 1953 – October 9, 2022) was an American blogger, journalist, publisher and writer. She also was the founder, editor-in-chief and president of Deadline Hollywood, a website with original content consisting of her and other veteran showbiz journalists' reporting and commentary on the business of the entertainment industry. She founded and was the chief executive officer of Hollywood Dementia LLC and its website, HollywoodDementia.com, for showbiz short fiction.


== Early life ==
Finke was born in New York (reported as either Manhattan or Long Island) on December 16, 1953, one of two daughters born to Jewish parents, Robert and Doris Finke. She was raised in the affluent village of Sands Point, New York.Finke was educated at Buckley Country Day School and the Hewitt School, before attending Wellesley College, where she studied political science and was the editor-in-chief of the college newspaper.


== Career ==
Finke's first job after Wellesley was in New York congressman Ed Koch's Washington, D.C. office. She decided to become a reporter after seeing how Koch and his staff would show deference to reporters.In 1975, Finke joined the Associated Press (AP) and covered Koch's successful 1977 New York City mayoral campaign. She then worked on the AP's foreign desk at the New York City headquarters, Baltimore, Boston, Moscow and London. Finke later worked for The Dallas Morning News. She joined the staff of Newsweek as a correspondent in Washington and Los Angeles, then at the Los Angeles Times as a staff writer, covering entertainment and features. Finke became the West Coast Editor for The New York Observer, and then New York, where she penned Hollywood business columns. She also wrote for The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, The Washington Post, Salon, Premiere and Los Angeles.Finke joined the New York Post in 2001, but was fired in early 2002, after she reported that The Walt Disney Company was destroying documents related to a licensing dispute. She then sued Disney and the Post for $10 million, alleging the companies had colluded to suppress coverage of the story; she received an out-of-court settlement. Afterward, LA Weekly hired her and began running her column ""Deadline Hollywood"". In 2006, she began the Deadline (Deadline Hollywood Daily until September 2009) blog as a daily online version of her weekly column. She described it as her ""forum to break news about the infotainment industry.""
The New York Times described Finke as ""a digital-age Walter Winchell"" with an ""in your face"" writing style, who is ""feared by [Hollywood] executives"". Deadline became a key information portal during the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, tripling her readership; according to the Times: ""Finke’s Web site has become a critical forum for Hollywood...But it [is the] strike that may have finally solidified her position as a Hollywood power broker"". Finke claimed to have worked ""almost around the clock"" during the strike; in 2009, the Los Angeles Times noted her announcement of a five-day vacation.In 2008, Finke was named on Elle's 25 most influential women in Hollywood list, and to the Heeb 100. In 2009, she sold Deadline to Jay Penske's Mail.com Media Corp, reportedly for $14 million, under an agreement by which she would continue as the editor-in-chief and President of the website which would feature her reporting and commentary.On November 5, 2013, Deadline Hollywood announced Nikki Finke's departure. On June 12, 2014, she launched NikkiFinke.com. On August 3, 2015, she launched HollywoodDementia.com as a site for showbiz short fiction written by her and other insiders. The New York Times said: ""Ms. Finke finds herself facing a daunting new chapter in her career: a plan to leave journalism and write and publish fiction about the entertainment industry.""""There is a lot of truth in fiction,"" she said. ""There are things I am going to be able to say in fiction that I can’t say in journalism right now."" Patrick Goldstein, a former Los Angeles Times film industry columnist, told The New York Times that ""everyone [in Hollywood] is secretly full of trepidation about what Nikki’s new site will be like. Will it be literary short stories, or will it be fiction as a thin disguise for the truth?""On May 11, 2016, Deadline printed Finke's remembrance at how she founded Deadline Hollywood on the occasion of the website's ten-year anniversary. ""When I started Deadline Hollywood Daily, as it was called way back in 2006, I needed a quicker way to report breaking entertainment news than my weekly newspaper column. So I bought the URL DeadlineHollywoodDaily.com for 14 bucks and change. I didn’t set out to be a disruptor. Or an internet journalist who created something out of nothing that put the Hollywood trades back on their heels, and today, under Penske Media ownership, is a website worth $100+ million. Or a woman with brass balls, attitude and ruthless hustle, who told hard truths about the moguls and who accurately reported scoops first.""


== Reception ==
In 2006, Finke's LA Weekly columns won First Place in the Alternative Weekly Awards in the category of ""Media Reporting/Criticism, Circulation >50,000"". In 2007, Finke won the Los Angeles Press Club's Southern California Journalism Award for ""Entertainment Journalist of the Year"", with the judges commenting: ""Reading Nikki Finke’s salaciously candid coverage of Hollywood and its inhabitants almost feels like a guilty pleasure. She mixes the news with fearless finger-wagging that’s just fun to read no matter the subject. She tackles the industry monoliths without the kiddy gloves and she seems to have command of the beat."" In the 2007 AltWeekly Awards, Deadline won Second Place.A studio executive said of Finke: ""She's very, very, very, accurate, extraordinarily so—you have a supposedly private conversation with two other people, and it's on her site within an hour."" Charlie Koones, former Variety publisher, called her a ""once-in-a-generation talent"".However, others questioned Finke's ""harsh tone"", ""summary executions"", ""penchant for innuendo and unnamed sources"", and allegedly giving better coverage to ""her favorites"" and frequent sources, such as Ari Emanuel and Ronald Meyer. In 2008, she was criticized for first posting a Sony press release and then adding her own analysis which contradicted the release without updating the time stamp, and in early 2009, Finke was accused of retroactively altering a Deadline Hollywood Daily report about the director of the third Twilight film.


== Personal life and death ==
In 1974, Finke became engaged to Jeffrey W. Greenberg. They were married from 1980 until their divorce in 1982.Finke's health declined in her later years, primarily from complications of diabetes. She died at a hospice facility in Boca Raton, Florida, on October 9, 2022, aged 68.

83,"Cara Carleton ""Carly"" Fiorina (; née Sneed; born September 6, 1954) is an American businesswoman and politician, known primarily for her tenure as chief executive officer (CEO) of Hewlett-Packard (HP) from 1999 to 2005. Fiorina was the first woman to lead a Fortune Top-20 company.In 2002, Fiorina oversaw what was then the largest technology sector merger in history, in which HP acquired rival personal computer manufacturer, Compaq. The transaction made HP the world's largest seller of personal computers. HP subsequently laid off 30,000 U.S. employees. Nonetheless, the number of employees exceeded the pre-merger figure and grew to 150,000 during her tenure. In February 2005, she was forced to resign as CEO and chair following a boardroom disagreement. She subsequently served as Chair of the philanthropic organization Good360.Fiorina ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 2010 and the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Fiorina was an adviser to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. In 2010, she won the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in California, but lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina was a candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, and was for seven days the vice-presidential running mate of Ted Cruz until he suspended his campaign. In 2020, Fiorina endorsed the presidential campaign of Democrat Joe Biden.


== Early life and education ==
Cara Carleton Sneed was born on September 6, 1954, in Austin, Texas, the daughter of Madelon Montross (née Juergens) and Joseph Tyree Sneed III. The name ""Carleton"", from which ""Carly"" is derived, has been used in every generation of the Sneed family since the Civil War. At the time of her birth, Fiorina's father was a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. He would later become dean of Duke University School of Law, Deputy U.S. Attorney General, and judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Her mother was an abstract painter. She is mainly of English and German ancestry, and was raised Episcopalian. Her paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Joseph P. Sneed, was a Methodist minister and educator in Texas. Her paternal great-great-great-great-uncle built the Constantine Sneed House in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Carly was a Brownie but did not become a Girl Scout due to her family's frequent moves. She attended Channing School, in London.  She later attended five different high schools, including one in Ghana, graduating from Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina. At one time she aspired to be a classical pianist. She received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy and medieval history at Stanford University, in 1976. During her summers, she worked as a secretary for Kelly Services. She attended the UCLA School of Law in 1976, but dropped out after one semester. She worked as a receptionist for six months at a real estate firm, Marcus & Millichap, moving up to a broker position. When she married in 1977, she and her husband moved to Bologna, Italy, where he was doing graduate work; there she did English tutoring to Italian businessmen.In 1980, Fiorina received a Master of Business Administration, in marketing, from the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1989 she obtained a Master of Science degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management, under the Sloan Fellows program.


== Business career ==


=== AT&T and Lucent ===

In 1980, Fiorina joined AT&T as a management trainee, selling telephone services to big federal agencies. In 1990, she became the company's first female officer as senior vice president overseeing the company's hardware and systems division, eventually heading its North American operations.In 1995, Fiorina led corporate operations for Lucent Technologies, Inc., a spin-off from AT&T of its Western Electric and Bell Labs divisions into a new company.  In that capacity, she reported to Lucent chief executive Henry B. Schacht. She played a key role in planning and implementing the 1996 initial public offering of a successful stock and company launch strategy.  The spin-off became one of the most successful IPOs in U.S. history, raising US$3 billion.Later in 1996, Fiorina was appointed president of Lucent's consumer products sector. In 1997, she was named group president for Lucent's US$19 billion global service-provider business, overseeing marketing and sales for the company's largest customer segment. That year, Fiorina chaired a US$2.5 billion joint venture between Lucent's consumer communications and Royal Philips Electronics, under the name Philips Consumer Communications (PCC). In the edition of October 12, 1998, of Fortune magazine, Fiorina was named ""The Most Powerful Woman in American Business"".Lucent added 22,000 jobs and revenues grew from US$19 billion to US$38 billion and the company's market share increased in every region for every product. According to Fortune magazine,  Lucent increased sales by lending money to their own customers, writing that ""In a neat bit of accounting magic, money from the loans began to appear on Lucent's income statement as new revenue while the dicey debt got stashed on its balance sheet as an allegedly solid asset"". Lucent's stock price grew 10-fold.


=== Hewlett-Packard (HP) ===


==== Hiring ====
In July 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company named Fiorina chief executive officer, succeeding Lewis Platt and prevailing over the internal candidate Ann Livermore. Matthew Boyle of Fortune magazine said of Fiorina's hiring as HP's first woman CEO that, ""Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it, as the first woman to lead a FORTUNE 20 company.""Writing in Fortune magazine in August 2015, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld described the hiring as  the result of ""a dysfunctional HP board committee, filled with its own poisoned politics, hired her with no CEO experience, nor interviews with the full board."" Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors, including: US$65 million in restricted stock to compensate her for the Lucent stock and options she left behind, a US$3 million signing bonus, a US$1 million annual salary (plus a US$1.25–US$3.75 million annual bonus), US$36,000 in mortgage assistance, a relocation allowance, and permission (and encouragement) to use company planes for personal affairs. Fortune also named her the most powerful woman in America for five consecutive years.


==== Separating Agilent Technologies from HP and proposed PWC acquisition ====
Although the decision to spin off the company's analytical instruments division pre-dated her arrival, one of her first major responsibilities as chief executive was overseeing the separation of the unit into the stand-alone Agilent Technologies. Fiorina proposed the acquisition of the technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for almost US$14 billion, but withdrew the bid after a lackluster reception from Wall Street. Following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the PwC consulting arm was acquired by IBM for less than US$4 billion.  HP later acquired Electronic Data Systems, another technology services company, which some considered a validation of Fiorina's strategy.


==== Compaq merger ====
In early September 2001, in the wake of the bursting of the Tech Bubble, Fiorina announced the acquisition of PC maker Compaq with US$25 billion in stock, which, at the time, was the second largest producer of personal computers, after Dell.  HP stock traded down by 30% on the news of the merger. The Compaq merger created the world's largest personal computer manufacturer in terms of units shipped.Fiorina was frequently at odds with HP's board of directors, and she had to fight with the board for the merger.  Walter Hewlett (the son of company co-founder William Hewlett) was a source of particularly strong opposition. Hewlett originally voted with the other board members to approve the Compaq deal, but he later changed his mind.  He launched a proxy fight against Fiorina's efforts which Fiorina won with a  ""razor-thin margin"" of 51.4% of the shareholders, with the institutional shareholders providing the bulk of the support. Fiorina was supported in the proxy battle by other board members, including Richard Hackborn, Philip M. Condit, George A. Keyworth, II, and Robert Knowling. Fiorina proceeded to reorganize HP and merge the parts of it that she kept with Compaq.The merger was met initially with almost universal skepticism. The February 7, 2005, issue of Fortune described her merger plan as ""failing"" and the prognosis as ""doubtful"". Business professor Robert Burgelman and former HP executive vice president, Webb McKinney, who led HP's post-merger integration team, analyzed the merger and concluded that it was ultimately successful. In 2008, former acting CEO of Compaq Ben Rosen stated that although Fiorina lacked the skills to run the merged company, her successors made it work. HP was able to integrate Compaq's operations and emerge as the world's largest seller of personal computers. The industry soon fell into decline, leading to further difficulties for the company. HP eventually wrote off US$1.2 billion from the acquisition as the personal computer market declined. Looking back, a 2011 The New York Times article described it as ""one of the more questionable deals of the time.""


==== Allegations of sales to Iran despite sanctions ====

In 1997, prior to Fiorina's joining the company, HP's Dutch subsidiary formed a partnership with a company in Dubai, Redington Gulf, which sold HP's products in Iran. Under Fiorina's leadership at HP, the company sold millions of dollars worth of printers and computer products to Iran through the foreign subsidiary, while U.S. export sanctions were in effect. After the story was initially reported by The Boston Globe in 2008, the SEC sent a letter of inquiry to HP, who responded that products worth US$120 million were sold in fiscal 2008 arguing that the sales did not violate export sanctions because they were made through a foreign subsidiary. According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary. HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.


==== Providing HP servers to the NSA ====
In a September 2015 interview with Michael Isikoff, Fiorina said that, in the weeks following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she received a phone call from Michael Hayden, then the director of the National Security Agency, asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance. Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina ""acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security"" to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: ""I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did,"" adding, ""They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What I knew at the time was our nation had been attacked."" Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency ""on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness."" According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be ""as transparent as possible, about as much as possible"".


==== Changes to HP culture ====
Fiorina's predecessor at HP had pushed for an outsider to replace him because he believed that the company had become complacent and that consensus-driven decision making was inhibiting the company's growth.  Fiorina instituted three major changes shortly after her arrival: replacing profit sharing with bonuses awarded if the company met financial expectations, a reduction in operating units from 83 to 12, and  consolidating back-office functions.Fiorina faced a backlash among HP employees and the tech community for her leading role in the demise of HP's egalitarian ""The HP Way"" work culture and guiding philosophy, which she felt hindered innovation. Because of changes to HP's culture, and requests for voluntary pay cuts to prevent layoffs (subsequently followed by the largest layoffs in HP's history), employee satisfaction surveys at HP – previously among the highest in America – revealed ""widespread unhappiness"" and distrust, and Fiorina was sometimes booed at company meetings and attacked on HP's electronic bulletin board.According to The Fiscal Times, Fiorina and others have argued that she ""laid the groundwork for some of HP's progress under her successors"", and that she shook the culture at HP so that it could compete in the Internet Age.


==== iPod+HP ====

In January 2004, Fiorina announced an agreement with Apple founder Steve Jobs for the iPod+HP – a co-branded iPod sold through HP's retail channels. As part of the agreement, HP was forbidden from selling a competitor to the iPod until August 2006 and HP agreed to pre-install iTunes on every computer sold. Two days before Fiorina announced the HP+iPod, Jobs announced a new product, the iPod mini, catching Fiorina off guard. HP did not sell the newer versions of the iPod in a timely fashion, leaving them to sell an outdated device for several months. In addition, Apple began selling its own iPods through the same retail channels. As a result, at the peak of the program, iPod+HP sales represented only a small portion of total iPod sales. In July 2005, soon after Fiorina resigned as CEO, her successor Mark Hurd ended HP's agreement with Apple, within days of taking office, a ""highly symbolic decision"" that was well-received as a return to innovation by HP.Steven Levy, writing in 2015 on the agreement, wrote that ""Steve Jobs blithely mugged her and HP's shareholders. By getting Fiorina to adopt the iPod as HP's music player, Jobs had effectively gotten his [iTunes] software installed on millions of computers for free, stifled his main competitor, and gotten a company that prided itself on invention to declare that Apple was a superior inventor. And he lost nothing ...""


==== Layoffs ====
In January 2001, HP laid off 1,700 marketing employees. In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting in more than 80,000 people signing up and saving HP US$130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company's 64-year history, but those cuts would not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced. In September 2001, Fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15,000 jobs in the event of a merger with Compaq.In all, Fiorina laid off 30,000 U.S. employees. According to PolitiFact, those 30,000 layoffs were ""as a result of the merger with Compaq....""  By 2004 the number of HP employees was about the same as the pre-merger total of HP and Compaq combined, and that 2004 number included roughly 8,000 employees of other companies acquired by HP since 2001.  Altogether, under Fiorina's leadership, HP had a net gain of employees, including employees from mergers as well as hires in countries outside the United States.In 1999, when Fiorina became CEO of HP, the company had 84,800 employees.  After the merger with Compaq, the company had a total of 145,000 employees worldwide.  At the time of her resignation in 2005, after HP had acquired several other companies, HP had about 150,000 employees.


==== Forced resignation ====
HP's revenue doubled and the rate of patent filings increased due to mergers with Compaq and other companies during Fiorina's stint as CEO. In addition, HP's cash flow increased by 40%, to around $6.8 billion.  However, the company underperformed by a number of other metrics: there were no gains in HP's net income despite a 70% gain in net income of the S&P 500 over this period; the company's debt rose from US$4.25 billion to US$6.75 billion; and its stock price fell by 50%, exceeding declines in the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector index and the NASDAQ. By contrast, stock prices for IBM and Dell fell by  27.5% and 3% respectively during this time.  The Compaq acquisition was not as transformative as Fiorina and the board had envisioned: in the merger proxy, they had forecasted that the PC division of the merged entities would generate an operating margin of 3.0% in 2003, while the actual figure was 0.1% in that year and 0.9% in 2004.In 2004, HP fell dramatically short of its predicted third-quarter earnings, and Fiorina fired three executives during a 5 AM telephone call. In early January 2005, the Hewlett-Packard board of directors discussed with Fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the company's performance and disappointing earning reports.  The board proposed a plan to shift her authority to HP division heads, which Fiorina resisted strongly. A week after the meeting, the confidential plan was leaked to The Wall Street Journal. According to BusinessWeek's Ben Elgin, directors were also concerned about the board's inability to work effectively with Fiorina.Less than a month later, the board brought back Tom Perkins and forced Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company.  The company's stock jumped 6.9 percent on news of her departure, adding almost three billion dollars to the value of HP in a single day.In her book Tough Choices, she referred to board members' behavior as ""amateurish and immature"".  Larry Sonsini, who investigated the leak related to Fiorina's forced resignation, described the board in his report to Fiorina as being ""dysfunctional.""On May 13, 2008, HP, under then-Chief Executive Mark Hurd, confirmed that it had reached a deal to buy Electronic Data Systems, the largest since the Compaq purchase. The price was a reported $12.6 billion. At the time of the announcement, Loren Steffy of The Houston Chronicle suggested that the EDS acquisition after Fiorina's tenure was evidence that her failed plan to acquire part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers was justified.Under the company's agreement with Fiorina, which was characterized as a golden parachute by Time magazine, and Yahoo! Finance, Fiorina received a severance package valued at US$21 million, which consisted of 2.5 times her annual salary plus bonus and the balance from accelerated vesting of stock options.
According to Fortune magazine, Fiorina collected over US$100 million in compensation during her short tenure at HP.


=== Business leadership image ===
In 2003, Fiorina was named by Fortune Magazine the most powerful woman in business, a position she held for five years. In 2004, she was included in the Time 100 ranking of ""most influential people in the world today"" and named tenth on the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women. In 2005, The Wall Street Journal described Fiorina as the epitome of ""an alluring, controversial new breed of chief executive officers who combine grand visions with charismatic but self-centered and demanding styles"". The same year, Wharton School of Business professor Michael Useem opined, ""Fiorina scored high on leadership style, but she failed to execute strategy"".Following her forced resignation from HP, several commentators ranked Fiorina as one of the worst American (or tech) CEOs of all time.  In 2008, InfoWorld grouped her with a list of products and ideas that flopped, declaring that her tenure as CEO of HP was the sixth worst tech flop of all time, and characterizing her as the ""anti-Steve Jobs"" for reversing the goodwill of ""geeks"" and alienating existing customers. During Fiorina's tenure as CEO, HP leased or purchased five planes, including two Gulfstream IVs, to replace four aging aircraft, only one of which had the range to fly overseas. One Gulfstream IV, acquired at a cost of US$30 million and available for Fiorina's ""exclusive"" use, became a rallying point among HP employees who complained of Fiorina's expensive self-promotion and top-down managerial style during a time of company layoffs. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale School of Management said in August 2015 that problems with Fiorina's leadership style were what caused HP to lose half its value during her tenure.Others have defended her business leadership decisions and viewed the Compaq merger as successful over the long term.


== Transition of career and public persona ==


=== Autobiography ===
In October 2006, Fiorina published an autobiography entitled Tough Choices, about her career and her views on issues, what constitutes a leader, how women can thrive in business, and the role technology will continue to play in reshaping the world. A review by NPR Books noted that ""The book covers Fiorina's rise and fall as America's most powerful female executive.""Earlier books by others about Fiorina's role in the merger at HP included: Backfire, (2003) by Peter Burrows, and Perfect Enough: Carly Fiorina and the Reinvention of Hewlett-Packard, (2003), by George Anders.  A 2003 review by The New York Times of these books said, ""Two new books about the deal and its main champion – Hewlett-Packard's chair and chief executive officer, Carly Fiorina – show that there is much investors can glean immediately from this merger.""


=== Other organizational involvement ===
In October 2007, Fiorina signed with the Fox Business Network as a business commentator.After resigning from HP, Fiorina served on the board  of Revolution Health Group and computer security company Cybertrust in 2005.  In 2006, she became a member of the board of directors for chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), but resigned from that board on November 30, 2009, with the company saying this was ""because she planned to devote her full time and energy"" to her Senate campaign.  She had attended 17% of the TSMC directors' meetings in 2009 and 20% of TSMC directors' meetings in 2008. She served as a member of the MIT Corporation from 2004 to 2012. She was a member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2005.   She is an honorary fellow of the London Business School. In July 2012, Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia appointed her to the James Madison University Board of Visitors. In 2015, Fiorina received an honorary degree and delivered the commencement address at Southern New Hampshire University.Fiorina is the chair and CEO of Carly Fiorina Enterprises, a business and charitable foundation. A spokesperson described Fiorina Enterprises as ""...a nonprofit enterprise that helped Fiorina structure speaking engagements and appearances while providing the public with information about her activities..."" The San Francisco Chronicle reported that, as of July 2009, she had ""never registered her Carly Fiorina Enterprises to conduct business in California, either with the California secretary of state or the clerk of Santa Clara County, where Fiorina lives.""


== Nonprofit work ==


=== Good360 ===
In April 2012, Fiorina became chair of Good360, a 501(c)(3) nonpartisan nonprofit organization in Alexandria, Virginia, which helps companies donate excess merchandise to charities. Good360 has been consistently ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the top 10 most efficient charities, and ranked as the 33rd largest charity in the United States. Good360 is ""the largest product donation marketplace in the world. We help companies take excess inventory and then distribute that excess inventory to 37,000 vetted charities around this country.""In September 2014, Fiorina led an effort by Good360 to get American corporations ""to help combat the Ebola virus in West Africa – by donating specific items."" She left the organization when she declared her presidential candidacy in 2015.


=== One Woman Initiative ===
Fiorina served as Fund Chair of One Woman Initiative (OWI), a partnership between the private sector and government agencies, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Department of State (DoS). OWI describes itself as ""An International Women's Empowerment Fund"" that seeks to ""support existing initiatives in Muslim majority countries and countries with large Muslim populations"" and ""focus on key empowerment issues including entrepreneurship, political leadership, and the rule of law.""  OWI said it would raise funds in order to give grants to achieve these objectives, with contributions managed through a separate section 501(c)(3) designated organization.In June 2009, USAID announced that OWI grants totaling over US$500,000 had been made to grassroots organizations in Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.


=== Opportunity International ===
On February 14, 2013, Opportunity International announced a partnership with Fiorina and OWI to provide financial resources, education and training to two million women living in poverty.  Fiorina was referred to as Global Ambassador to Opportunity International. On May 4, 2015, Opportunity International announced that Fiorina was resigning from the Board after the announcement of her presidential candidacy.


=== Fiorina Foundation ===
Fiorina is the chair and CEO of the Fiorina Foundation, a charity that has donated to causes including Care-a-Van for Kids, a transportation program to aid seriously ill children, and the African Leadership Academy, an educational institution in South Africa.  The foundation 'enables corporations, spokeswomen entrepreneurs and philanthropists alike to address some of the world's most challenging issues,' according to Fiorina's Web site, carlyfiorina.com.""The San Francisco Chronicle reported that ""Records also show that her Fiorina Foundation has never registered with the Internal Revenue Service or the state attorney general's charitable trust division, which tax-exempt charities are required to do. A spokeswoman commented that ""Fiorina and her staff believed the foundation was not required to file with the IRS because it accepted no outside contributions and donated only her personal wealth to worthy causes.""


=== Colonial Williamsburg Foundation ===
In 2017, Fiorina joined the board of trustees for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. In December 2020, she was elected the chair of the board of trustees.


== Political career ==
Fiorina has never held public office, but said that her status as an outsider is a positive attribute, given that in her opinion, professional politicians have failed to deliver to the American people, stating in an interview with Fox News in 2015 that ""82% of the American people now think we need people from outside the professional political class to serve in public office.""


=== Republican National Committee fundraising chair and 2008 campaign ===
In 2006, Fiorina worked as an advisor for Republican Senator John McCain's presidential campaign. The New York Times noted that while she did not want to run, she was an executive who could possibly become a candidate for president. On March 7, 2008, Fiorina was named fundraising chair for the Republican National Committee's ""Victory"" initiative. She was reportedly a ""point person"" for the McCain campaign on issues related to business and economic affairs. Fiorina's severance package from Hewlett-Packard in 2005 was viewed by some as a political liability during the campaign. Referring to the McCain campaign, Newsweek described Fiorina as ""the most prominent surrogate on economics issues in any of the major campaigns.""Earlier that day, she defended the selection of Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate and said that Palin was being subjected to sexist attacks, a charge she repeated a few days later in response to one of the Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin.When asked during a radio interview on September 15, 2008, whether she thought Palin had the experience to run a major company like Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina answered ""No, I don't.  But that's not what she's running for. Running a corporation is a different set of things."" When questioned about her answer, she answered, ""I don't think John McCain could run a major corporation."" Fiorina further said that none of the candidates on either ticket had the experience to run a major corporation. After media coverage of Fiorina's comments, she ""disappeared from public view"" and planned television appearances were cancelled, although she continued to chair the party's fundraising committee. Responding to Barack Obama's victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary, Fiorina sought to attract more women to the Republican camp by praising Clinton's effort.


==== Vice presidential campaign speculation ====
In early 2008, she was referred to in media sources as a potential vice presidential candidate, In discussing the possibility of Fiorina becoming McCain's running mate, political analyst Stuart Rothenberg pointed out her potential downside, stating that she ""is rather easy to sketch out"" because she would ""become a talking point for Democrats"" who would focus on Fiorina's generous severance package from when she had left HP and her management style. Rothenberg concluded that Fiorina was ""like a dream come true"" for Democratic opposition researchers.


=== Defense Business Board and Central Intelligence Agency ===
Fiorina performed unpaid service on the Defense Business Board, which looked at staffing issues, among others, at The Pentagon.Fiorina spent two years leading the Central Intelligence Agency's External Advisory Board, from 2007 to 2009, and became chair of that board, when the board was first created in 2007 by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during the George W. Bush administration.


=== 2010 U.S. Senate candidacy for California ===

On November 4, 2009, Fiorina formally announced her candidacy in the 2010 Senate election in a bid to unseat incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina's campaign in the Republican primary for that seat received a number of endorsements, including one from Sarah Palin in the form of a Facebook note. Her campaign ad about Republican rival Tom Campbell featuring a ""Demon Sheep"" – created by Fiorina advertising consultant Fred Davis III – generated largely negative international publicity. After the ad went viral, the California Democratic Party created a parody of the ad depicting Fiorina herself as a demon sheep.On June 8, 2010, Fiorina won the Republican primary election for the Senate with over 50 percent of the vote, beating Campbell and State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore.A Los Angeles Times search of public records indicated Fiorina had failed to vote in most elections. Fiorina responded: ""I'm a lifelong registered Republican but I haven't always voted, and I will provide no excuse for it. You know, people die for the right to vote. And there are many, many Californians and Americans who exercise that civic duty on a regular basis. I didn't. Shame on me.""The Los Angeles Times noted that Fiorina had conservative positions on certain social issues. She personally opposed abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the mother's life.  As a private citizen, she stated that she voted for Proposition 8, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Following an August 4, 2010, federal court ruling that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, Fiorina expressed disagreement with the ruling, saying that California voters spoke clearly against same-sex unions when a majority approved the proposition in 2008. She stated that she opposed litmus tests for Supreme Court nominations and did not favor a federal ""personhood"" amendment. Fiorina had called global warming a ""serious issue"" but said that the science surrounding it is inconclusive, saying ""I think we should have the courage to examine the science on an ongoing basis."" In a campaign ad, Fiorina likened Boxer's concerns over global warming to worrying about ""the weather."" Fiorina accepted contributions from the coal industry as well as Koch Industries. Fiorina opposed the cap-and-trade legislation supported by Boxer, and thought efforts to control greenhouse gases would cost 3 million jobs and are ""massively destructive"".In financial disclosures, Fiorina identified her net worth at between US$30 million and US$120 million, and by October 22, Fiorina had contributed a total of US$6.5 million to her own race.Sarah Palin was set to appear at a GOP fundraiser two weeks ahead of the November 2 election, but neither Meg Whitman (the Republican nominee for Governor of California) nor Fiorina – both big-name Republicans –  planned to attend. The prediction was that Palin's primary endorsement would jeopardize her general election candidacy.Boxer won the general election, defeating Fiorina 52.2% to 42.2%.


=== ""Unlocking Potential Project"" PAC ===
Fiorina  launched and developed a political action committee (PAC) known as ""Up-Project"" (short for ""Unlocking Potential Project"") from 2011 to 2014.  The stated mission of the organization was ""...to engage women with new messages and new messengers by focusing on personal interactions with voters and going beyond the traditional methods of identifying, persuading and turning-out voters...""  In November 2014, The Washington Post reported that ""Helping Fiorina chart her political future are consultants Frank Sadler, who once worked for Koch Industries, and Stephen DeMaura, a strategist who heads Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group in Virginia""; The Up-Project website lists Fiorina as chair.


=== American Conservative Union Foundation and CPAC ===
On October 1, 2013, Al Cardenas, chair of the American Conservative Union (ACU), appointed Fiorina as chair of the American Conservative Union Foundation (ACUF), the ACU's educational arm. The ACU is a conservative 501(c)(4) organization, while the ACUF is its affiliated 501(c)(3) foundation, which organizes the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).Fiorina was co-chair of CPAC 2014, making a speech at the conference. At CPAC 2015, Fiorina again made a speech at the conference. It was speculated that Fiorina would announce her candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in that speech, but Fiorina did not, instead making her official announcement months later, on May 4, 2015, in a television and promotional video, therein repeating her talking points from CPAC and including an attack on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Fiorina resigned as ACU Foundation chair in early 2015.


=== U.S. presidential campaign, 2016 ===

Fiorina ruled out running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but refused to rule out running for president in 2016 or Governor of California in 2018. In November 2014, The Washington Post reported that Fiorina was ""actively exploring"" a run for president. Her business background and status as the only CEO and the only woman in a ""sea of suited men"" were mentioned as positives, though Republican strategists pointed to her poor 2010 Senate performance, unpaid campaign debt, and dismissal from HP as ""considerable challenges"" to her prospects. In March 2015, Fiorina said on Fox News Sunday that there was a ""higher than 90% chance"" that she would run for president in 2016.On May 4, 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy during an interview on Good Morning America, with George Stephanopoulos. Fiorina entered the race with immediate criticism of Hillary Clinton. It was reported that the GOP saw Fiorina as ""the tip of the spear"" in its attack of the Clinton campaign because she was uniquely positioned to isolate her criticisms of Clinton from claims of gender bias.Shortly after Fiorina announced her entry into the 2016 presidential race, in a replay of her 2010 senatorial race, the social media and editorial outlets questioned her tenure as HP's CEO as a basis for her run for president, focusing around US job cuts and offshoring that Fiorina directed during her tenure at HP, and contrasting it with the high compensation bonuses she received from the company. Campaign Manager, Sarah Isgur Flores, deflected the job cut criticism saying, Fiorina ""worked hard to save as many jobs as possible.""On August 6, Fiorina participated in Fox News's first GOP debate. Failing to qualify for one of the Fox News prime-time debate slots, she was relegated to the debate airing earlier the same day. Fiorina's performance led news sources to conclude she had won the early debate. Following the debate, several pundits correctly predicted that her polling numbers would surge. On August 9, Fiorina reported an uptick in fundraising support. In an online poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey on August 10, Fiorina came in fourth of the seventeen Republican contenders with 8% of the sampled Republican primary voters saying they would support her in a primary or a caucus, a gain in support of six points from previous polling data. At another debate in September, hosted by CNN, Fiorina misrepresented a Planned Parenthood sting video, describing a grisly scene which was not in the video. She was sharply criticized for this in the media; the gaffe consumed much of the post-debate coverage. Planned Parenthood responded that she had lied, saying it was ""not the first time Carly Fiorina has lied."" PolitiFact chief editor Angie Drobnic Holan mentioned this particular lie in a December 2015 comparison of the presidential candidates with regard to their truthfulness. In the comparison, Fiorina scored 50% falsehood, the sixth worst performance.The National Review pointed out her role as foil to Hillary Clinton, saying ""Carly Fiorina is no doubt getting attention because of her unique background, but more and more people are staying to listen because she has something fresh to say"", and that ""Fiorina also seems to relish the role of being the most pointed critic of Hillary Clinton.... She contrasts her background as a 'problem solver' with Clinton's record as a professional politician."" The Nation commented, ""With so-called women's issues poised to play an unprecedented role in the upcoming election, Republicans need someone who can troll Hillary Clinton without seeming sexist."" Meg Whitman, then CEO of Hewlett-Packard, stated that in her opinion Fiorina was not qualified to be President of the United States, stating that a business background is important but that having worked in government is also important, and that ""it's very difficult for your first role in politics to be President of the United States"".As part of her financial disclosures related to her candidacy, Fiorina reported a net worth of US$59 million, with US$12 million in income in 2013. International Business Times estimates Fiorina's net worth between US$30 million and US$120 million.Her performances in early debates for the Republican primary nomination, particularly her rebukes of front-runner Donald Trump in the September 16, 2015, debate, earned her a significant spike in the polls from 3% to 15% post-debate, but her polling numbers dropped to 4% by October, and to 3% in December.
On February 10, due to weak results in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Fiorina announced that her campaign was suspended. On March 9, 2016, Fiorina endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz for President, saying she was ""horrified"" by Donald Trump, and that Cruz was the only candidate that could stop him.


=== Vice presidential campaign and aftermath ===
On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party's presidential nominee, he would choose Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate, but after losing the Indiana primary six days later, he suspended his campaign, making her vice-presidential candidacy the shortest in modern American history.Fiorina received one electoral college vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Texas. Following Trump's election, Fiorina was considered for the position of Director of National Intelligence during the 2016 transition period. In 2020, Fiorina endorsed Joe Biden's presidential campaign due to her disapproval of President Donald Trump.


== Political positions ==
When she first entered politics as a Senate candidate in November 2009, Carly Fiorina was ""considered to be a moderate Republican with little history on social issues"" and her views changed during her run for Senate and her run for President in 2016. In 2017, she has described herself as conservative. In 2020, Fiorina announced that she would vote for Joe Biden for President. FiveThirtyEight, a non-partisan organization which analyzes candidates' positions and conducts polling, considered Fiorina to be within the moderate and establishment wings of the GOP.


=== Social issues ===
Fiorina is anti-abortion. She expressed support for legislation to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, with an exception for cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. In 2010, she said that Roe v. Wade was settled law, but later reversed that position. Fiorina supported overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in the United States, allowing states to set their own abortion policies. She does support embryonic stem-cell research if the embryos were not created for that purpose.In a February 2015 speech, Fiorina acknowledged the scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity, but expressed skepticism that government can affect the issue, and has ""implied that targeting the coal industry will not solve the problem"".Fiorina said in May 2015 that ""drug addiction shouldn't be criminalized"" and cited ""decriminalizing drug addiction and drug use"" as an example of a successful reform. Fiorina opposes the legalization of marijuana, but says that she believes in states' rights, and that as president she will not enforce the federal ban on marijuana in Colorado, where voters have legalized marijuana as a matter of state law.While running for president, Fiorina has been a critic of the Common Core State Standards. In September 2015, Fiorina said: ""No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, Common Core – they're all big, bureaucratic programs that are failing our nation."" This was a reversal of her position on federal education policies during her 2010 campaign for U.S. Senate from California.  In that campaign, Fiorina issued a position paper in which she ""strongly advocated for metric-based accountability in schools"" and ""praised No Child Left Behind as setting high standards, and Race to the Top for using internationally-benchmarked measures.""In California, Fiorina supported the DREAM Act, which would allow children brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were under the age of 16 to secure permanent U.S. residency and a path to citizenship, if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces.Carly Fiorina opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions. She later said that she hoped the nation would support Obergefell v. Hodges, the decision legalizing same-sex marriage, and also respect individuals' consciences. In November 2009, during a The Wall Street Journal interview, Fiorina said that she voted in favor of Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition that banned same-sex marriage in that state. During the 2010 United States Senate election in California, Fiorina was endorsed by GOProud, a gay conservative organization.  In 2010, Fiorina stated that she supported the Defense of Marriage Act, but also supported civil unions. She supported the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell. In 2015, Fiorina reaffirmed her support for civil unions with the same government benefits accorded to married persons. She does not support a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In 2017, Fiorina headlined the 40th anniversary of Log Cabin Republicans, a political action committee which supports LGBT rights. In her address, she said, ""Everyone has to be free to be who they are.""Fiorina believes employers should decide whether they should provide paid maternity leave to their employees and it should not be mandated by the government, noting that some companies in the private sector are already doing so.  She also pointed out that HP, while she was CEO, offered paid maternity leave.


=== Foreign and military policy ===
Fiorina has criticized the international nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that Iran is ""at the heart"" of evil in the Middle East; that the agreement is a ""flawed deal""; and that ""there is a lot of reason to be suspicious"" of it. Fiorina also suggested that verification provisions in the agreement were insufficient and that approval of the agreement by the international community and the U.S.'s negotiating partners was suspect because Russia and China have an interest in gaining access to Iran's economy and the European Union ""has negotiated, frankly, a number of weak deals."" Fiorina opposes the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations, telling Hugh Hewitt that if elected she would close the U.S. embassy in Havana.In a January 2015 discussion with an Iowa political blogger, Fiorina said of the Chinese: ""They're not terribly imaginative. They're not entrepreneurial. They don't innovate. That's why they're stealing our intellectual property."" Fiorina supports keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba open. In September 2015, Fiorina ""offered a vigorous defense of CIA waterboarding,"" a tactic used by the United States during the George W. Bush-era War on Terror. Fiorina's interest in national security issues led to her name being floated for the position of Director of National Intelligence by Donald Trump during the 2016 transition period.


=== Economic and fiscal Issues ===
Fiorina was critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care reform legislation during the debate in 2009 that led to the act's passage.  Fiorina has supported repealing the ACA during both her 2010 Senate run in California, and in her 2015 presidential campaign. Fiorina has called the law ""deeply flawed"" and a ""vast legislative overreach."" Fiorina supports an individual mandate that would require individuals to carry ""high-deductible 'catastrophic care' insurance plans and use federal dollars to subsidize state-based high-risk pools to provide care for those who otherwise cannot afford it.""Fiorina has stated that ""there is no constitutional role for the federal government to be setting minimum wages"" and that the minimum wage ""is a classic example of a policy that is best carried out in the states"" because economic conditions in New Hampshire vary significantly from more expensive economic conditions in Los Angeles or New York. Florina also believes that raising the federal minimum wage would ""hurt those who are looking for entry-level jobs"".Fiorina opposes net neutrality rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and has said she would ""roll back"" that policy: ""Regulation over innovation is a really bad role for government."" Fiorina has repeatedly criticized the rules, arguing that ""the FCC just issued – without anyone commenting on it or anyone voting on it – 400 pages of new regulations over the Internet. It's not good, it's not helpful.""Fiorina ""generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy"". She has condemned the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, saying in April 2015 that ""We should get rid of Dodd-Frank and start again."" Fiorina has been questioned by some in the media for stating that not ""a single regulation has ever been repealed."" Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post said that, ""Important parts of the economy have been deregulated in recent decades. While the repeal of a specific rule is relatively rare, there are certainly examples.""Fiorina favors lowering tax rates, simplifying the tax code, and closing loopholes that she says mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers.  Florina has said ""the government needs to take in less tax money, not more."" During her 2010 Senate campaign, Fiorina ""called for eliminating the estate tax and capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses, and lowering marginal tax rates."" Fiorina opposes proposals to increase the federal gas tax or state gas taxes in order to fund the Highway Trust Fund, asserting in a February 2015 The Wall Street Journal op-ed that ""Any gas tax hike, big or small, will harm American families and hurt economic growth."" Fiorina opposed the federal stimulus package of 2009 intended to create short-term job growth and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy, calling it a waste of taxpayer money. Fiorina has said she would cut the pay of federal workers and base their compensation on performance.  She also advocates zero-based budgeting for the federal budget, which would start the annual budgeting process for each department from a baseline of zero.Fiorina favors expanding the H-1B visa program. Writing in opposition to proposals she considered protectionist in a 2004 The Wall Street Journal op-ed, Fiorina said that while ""America is the most innovative country,"" it would not remain so if the country were to ""run away from the reality of the global economy."" Fiorina said to Congress in 2004: ""There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore.  We have to compete for jobs as a nation.""


== Personal life ==
Fiorina (then Cara Carleton Sneed) married Todd Bartlem, a Stanford classmate, in June 1977. They divorced in 1984.  In 1981, she was introduced to AT&T executive Frank Fiorina, who told her on their third date that she would one day be running the company. She married him in 1985; it was the second marriage for both. Fiorina has said that they wanted to have children together but ""that wasn't God's plan"". Frank Fiorina took early retirement from AT&T in 1998 at age 48 to travel with and support his wife in her career.Frank Fiorina had two daughters, Traci and Lori Ann, from his first marriage. Their mother, Patricia, was awarded custody of both children following the divorce. Carly helped her husband raise his daughters. Lori Ann struggled with alcoholism, prescription drug addiction and bulimia. She died in 2009 at age 35.In February 2009, Fiorina was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy at Stanford Hospital in March 2009, followed by chemotherapy, which caused her to temporarily lose her hair, and later radiation therapy. She was given ""an excellent prognosis for a full recovery.""  In late 2009, during her campaign for the United States Senate seat held by Barbara Boxer, Fiorina humorously told a group of supporters: ""I have to say that after chemotherapy, Barbara Boxer just isn't that scary anymore.""According to the financial disclosures filed by Fiorina's campaign in June 2015, she and her husband have a combined net worth of $59 million. Fiorina has released the income tax returns that she and her husband jointly filed in 2013 and 2012; in those years, the Fiorinas reported income of almost $2 million and $1.3 million, respectively.Fiorina and her husband live in a home in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Mason Neck, Virginia, overlooking the Potomac River.

88,"Michèle Angélique Flournoy (, born December 14, 1960) is an American defense policy advisor and former government official. She was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy under President Bill Clinton and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Barack Obama.
As Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Flournoy was the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Department of Defense. In that position, Flournoy crafted the Obama administration's counter-insurgency policy in Afghanistan and helped persuade President Obama to intervene militarily in Libya.
In 2007, Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security. She is a co-founder and the current managing partner of WestExec Advisors.


== Early life and education ==
Flournoy was born on December 14, 1960, in Los Angeles, California. Her father, George Flournoy, was a cinematographer who worked on shows including I Love Lucy and The Odd Couple. He died of a heart attack when she was 14 years old. Flournoy attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California.

Kennedy School of Government, where she was a research fellow in its International Security Program.


== Career ==


=== Clinton administration (1996–2000) ===
Flournoy served in the Clinton administration in the United States Department of Defense, where she was both Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Threat Reduction and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy.Flournoy was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1996, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1998 and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 2000.While serving under the Clinton administration as a deputy assistant secretary of defense, Flournoy was the principal author of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, which argued that ""determined U.S. forces must be capable of fighting and winning two major theater wars nearly simultaneously"".She was a primary contributor to the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review.


=== Public policy research ===
Flournoy then joined the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University (NDU) as a research professor, founding and leading NDU's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) working group.Flournoy then moved to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where she worked as a senior advisor on a range of defense policy and international security issues. In 2002, a year before the US invasion of Iraq, she argued for preemptive strikes by the US against foreign weapons stockpiles. Flournoy told The Washington Post, ""In some cases, preemptive strikes against an adversary's [weapons of mass destruction] capabilities may be the best or only option we have to avert a catastrophic attack against the United States.""


==== Founder of CNAS (2007) ====
In 2007, Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) with Kurt M. Campbell. She was named CNAS's president. Flournoy and Campbell wrote a 2007 policy paper called ""The Inheritance and the Way Forward"" that advocated for a US foreign policy ""grounded in a common-sense pragmatism rather than ideology"".


=== Obama's first term (2009–2012) ===
After the 2008 presidential election, Flournoy was selected as one of the review team leads for the Obama transition at the Department of Defense. On January 8, 2009, President-elect Obama announced that he was nominating her as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, to serve under Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. When the United States Senate confirmed her nomination on February 9, 2009, she became the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Department of Defense.In 2009, Flournoy told The New York Times that she had spent much of her adult life steeped in the practice of war. ""We're trying to recognize that warfare may come in a lot of different flavors in the future,"" she said.While serving in the Obama administration, Flournoy crafted the administration's policy of counter-insurgency in Afghanistan. She supported the surge of troops in Afghanistan and helped to design the administration's policy in that regard. In 2009, as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, she also supported a US ""civilian surge"" in Afghanistan, coupling increased economic aid with at least 400 new counter-insurgency experts, and doubling the US military presence to 68,000 troops by the end of the year.From February 2009 to February 2012, Flournoy was a principal advisor to U.S. Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Leon Panetta.On December 12, 2011, Flournoy announced that she would step down in February 2012 to return to private life and contribute to President Barack Obama's re-election bid.


==== Libya ====
In 2011, Flournoy, then Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, helped persuade President Obama to intervene militarily in Libya, despite opposition from members of Congress and key White House advisors, such as Joe Biden, Vice President; Tom Donilon, National Security Advisor; and Robert Gates, Defense Secretary. Flournoy supported the NATO-led imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to oust resistant leader Muammar Gaddafi, accused of ordering the killing of demonstrators and promising to ""hunt the rebels down and show no mercy."" Flournoy said imposition of a no-fly zone necessitated first destroying Libya's air defenses with US and British cruise missiles targeting the Libyan missile defense system, and US B-2 bombers attacking Libyan airfields.


=== Rainmaker and think-tanker (2012–present) ===
After leaving the Obama administration, Flournoy joined Boston Consulting Group as a senior advisor to its Washington D.C.-based public sector practice. It was reported that under Flournoy's direction the Boston Consulting Group's military contracts went ""from $1.6 million in 2013 to $32 million in 2016"".In a 2013 conversation with the Council on Foreign Relations, Flournoy said she had supported US military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Critics who disagreed with Flournoy described the war on Libya as ""disastrous"" in its destabilization of entire regions in the Middle East and North Africa, facilitating the transfer of arms to extremists across countries. Two years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, Flournoy defended the US military intervention in Libya, telling the Council on Foreign Relations: ""I think we were right to do it.""As well as being, for a time, a member of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of the CIA Director’s External Advisory Board, Flournoy was, in 2014, a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.At least in 2014 Flournoy sat on the board of the Atlantic Council.


==== Hypothetical role in Clinton administration (2016) ====
In June 2016 while she was rumoured to be ""Hillary Clinton's Likely Defense Secretary"", Flournoy advocated regime change in Syria, supporting ""limited military coercion"" to remove President Bashar al-Assad from office.


==== Co-founder WestExec Advisors (2017) ====
Flournoy co-founded WestExec Advisors where she holds the post of managing partner. In 2017, Flournoy, along with Antony Blinken, US Deputy Secretary of State in the Obama administration, co-founded WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm.


==== As corporate director ====
In 2018, Flournoy joined the board of Booz Allen Hamilton, receiving $440,000, mostly in company stock options during the first two years since her appointment. She has received some criticism for her role as a director at Booz Allen Hamilton, including by authors affiliated with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO).As of December 1, 2020, Flournoy was an advisor to Pine Island Capital, a private equity firm. In December 2020, Pine Island raised $218 million to pay for investments in military and aerospace and other industries. In its September 2020 S.E.C. filing, Pine Island forecast that the Defense Department ""will prioritize rapid technological advancements"" in artificial intelligence and other technologies.Flournoy was in 2018 on the board of directors of Amida Technology Solutions.


==== Hypothetical role in Biden administration (2020) ====
Flournoy was widely speculated to be a leading contender to serve as Secretary of Defense under President Joe Biden. She was tarnished by liberal critics for her international consulting and private equity associations whereas her colleague, Antony Blinken was not.During the 2020 presidential transition of Joe Biden, Flournoy had been viewed as being ""at the top of Biden's list"" to be Secretary of Defense. In December 2020, Gen. Lloyd Austin was reported to have been chosen instead.In a webinar hosted by the Israel Policy Forum in June 2020, Flournoy expressed concern that Israel's proposed unilateral annexation of the West Bank could lead Congress to deny almost $4 billion in annual US aid to Israel. ""I would hate to see some in Congress decided they are going to hold hostage our security assistance to Israel as a way of protesting their policies in the West Bank."" Flournoy added that a fraying of the US-Israel relationship would be disastrous for US interests.During the 2020 US presidential election, Flournoy stated that she opposed lifting economic sanctions against North Korea and Iran, though might support waivers for medical supplies during the global COVID-19 pandemic.In an August 2020 interview with Defense News, Flournoy stated that she favored shifting money from more traditional military expenditures to unmanned systems ""that dramatically improve ... our ability to project power to defend an interest or an ally who's under threat"".In November 2020, when Flournoy was under consideration for Secretary of Defense, she wrote, “the department and Congress may want to consider a new type of funding authority that supports both the development and testing of new digital technologies."" The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) criticized Flournoy for using ""opaque"" language to skirt government oversight.In June 2020 Flournoy argued that the US must invest in new military technologies and more long-range missiles, escalate US troop deployment to the South China Sea area, and step up roving war games in Asia to deter Chinese aggression. Without such ramped-up US military activity and absent the technology to ward off a Chinese cyber attack on US navigation systems, Flournoy asserted the US could stumble into a nuclear confrontation with China over Taiwan sovereignty.In a November 2020 CNAS report, ""Sharpening the U.S. Military Edge: Critical Steps for the Next Administration,"" Flournoy argued the U.S. military must be more competitive with China ""to keep its military-technological edge."" She called for prioritizing artificial intelligence, cyber warfare, unmanned and autonomous weapons systems.


== Political positions ==
Spencer Ackerman has described Flournoy as a centrist. Van Jackson, a former colleague, described her approach as that of a ""classic liberal internationalist"".Flournoy's 2020 Asia essay was criticized by historian Andrew Bacevich, who said goading China into a high-tech arms race was not prudent when other areas, such as addressing the climate crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, demanded collaboration, not competition. Bacevitch added that Flournoy's call for increased spending on unmanned space systems rested on premises that advanced technology always wins wars and that military might equals security, saying ""The immediate threats to our collective safety and well-being—perhaps even to our Republic—are ... not on the other side of the planet.""Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin argued in December 2020 that Flournoy would be the wrong choice for Secretary of Defense because she would ""steer the American empire farther down its current path of lost wars, corrupt militarism and terminal decline"".


== Other affiliations ==
She is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations.In 2012, Flournoy was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.As of 2020, Flournoy is a member of the board of directors of Spirit of America.As of October 2023, she serves on the Special Competitive Studies Project's board of advisors.


== Personal life ==
Flournoy's husband, W. Scott Gould, is a retired captain who served for 26 years in the United States Navy Reserve. He was a vice president at IBM before becoming United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The couple has  three children and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.

=== First Avenue Productions ===
In the year 2000 Byron Frank and a team of business associates bought the First Avenue building while the club was struggling against larger trends in the music industry, growing local competition, and corporate music promoters. On November 2, 2004 First Avenue's original owner, and Byron Frank's former business partner, Allen Fingerhut took First Avenue into bankruptcy leading to 130 employees being out of work and multiple scheduled concerts needing to be rescheduled. Following a legal battle, protests from local music fans, and attention to the situation from former Minneapolis Mayor and long time First Avenue concert attendee R.T. Rybak, the case was resolved (the judge presiding in the bankruptcy case noted, ""I gather there is some urgency about this""), and the club was reopened by new partners including former First Avenue concert promoters, talent buyers, and general managers, Jack Meyers and Steve McClellan along with Byron Frank, with shows resuming after one week's closure.
In 2009 Byron Frank experienced a stroke leading him to call his two daughters and inform them that he intended to sell First Avenue to Live Nation or another deep-pocketed corporation if neither of them were willing to take over.""The idea that the club could wind up in the hands of a company that's not responsible to Minneapolis/St. Paul and didn't inherently understand the beauty of this market ... was unfathomable,"" Dayna said in a 2014 interview.In August 2014 First Avenue announced the purchase of the Turf Club in Saint Paul which dates back to 1940. Largely leaving the venue the same, the First Avenue team updated the speaker systems and renovated the bathrooms while keeping the core of the building as it was at the point of purchase. Former owner Tom Scanlon said “I had lots of people interested in buying the place, but First Avenue just made perfect sense. They know the place and the business very well. I'm confident the future of the Turf Club is absolutely safe in their hands.”March 10, 2017 the Palace Theatre hosted the first concert with First Avenue Productions co-managing and co-operating with the City of Saint Paul. Frank and First Avenue Productions worked with the city leaders to oversee a $14.7 million renovation converting the building from a shuttered movie theater to a 2,800 capacity venue featuring contemporary music and events.On October 1, 2018 First Avenue purchased and took over the operation of the Fine Line in Minneapolis. Originally opened in 1987 the Fine Line has a capacity of 650 people for concerts. ""We’re incredibly excited to add the Fine Line to the First Avenue family, and really — more importantly — to keep this local venue independently owned and operated,"" said owner Frank in a press release.On October 24, 2018 First Avenue announced that it had purchased the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul from Minnesota Public Radio. The Fitzgerald long operated as the home of A Prairie Home Companion from 1978 until 2016 when musician Chris Thile took over the program and renamed it Live From Here. In a Minnesota Public Radio article Frank is quoted as saying: ""St. Paul is becoming a destination for many musicians, just as Minneapolis has been. We're committed to helping to grow St. Paul's music scene as well.""In a 2021 Relix article Frank recalled memories of her time growing up in the club, reflected on her work at the club since her father's stroke, and stated that: ""it became my mission to keep it independent and keep it intact—and to make sure that future generations of Minnesotans could enjoy it.""


=== National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) ===

On March 12, 2020, 75 independent venues and stakeholders joined for a call organized by Independent Venue Week (IVW), to discuss COVID-19's disruption of the live entertainment industry.NIVA formed following the IVW call to lobby for assistance from the federal government after thousands of small businesses across the country were imperiled by the spread of coronavirus. Within a matter of days its membership grew to some 450 members and a week later it had expanded to 900. NIVA currently represents over 3,000 venues, promoters, and festivals in all 50 states and Washington D.C.
On April 9, 2020, NIVA's official formation as a 501(c)(6) trade association was announced along with the news that Frank would serve as the board president.
Frank told Pollstar ""NIVA came out of an Independent Venue Week town hall that Moose started having about a week after everything was being shuttered, and it was just so powerful. It was probably the first time for many of us to talk to each other, to independent promoters and venue owners, and be able to share resources and knowledge. We realized that if we are going to make it through we have to do it together and be unified. At the end of one of the town halls we talked about the need for a group, a trade association or alliance, to be formed with all the independents to share knowledge and resources and, most importantly, to get some representation in D.C. as these stimulus bills are being written to make sure we have resources and protection for the long-term health and future of our industry.""Frank told Rolling Stone that ""90% of its member venues report they do not have cash on hand to last more than six months without federal intervention, and 55% say they do not have enough to last more than three months.""NIVA immediately went to work to become the team that organized lobbying and grassroots efforts to pass the bipartisan Save Our Stages Act, which became the Shuttered Venues Operators Grant Program, that was signed into law as part of the second COVID-19 Relief Bill on December 27, 2020.This process led to over 2 million letters from music fans being delivered to Congress.On June 18, 2020, 600 artists, including Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, Mavis Staples, Lady Gaga, André 3000, Coldplay, Willie Nelson, Billie Ellish, Gary Clark Jr., Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, Miranda Lambert, Billy Joel, Earth Wind & Fire, Kacey Musgraves, Leon Bridges, Wyclef Jean, Bon Iver, Jay Leno, Tiffany Haddish, Jeff Foxworthy, Jerry Seinfeld, and Tig Notaro, issued a letter to Congress asking legislators to provide financial support for independent venues and promoters.October 16–18, 2020 NIVA and YouTube hosted the #SOSFest which Billboard called the most star-packed, culturally consequential music experience of the pandemic. Stars ranging from Billie Eilish to Dave Matthews and 33 others performed live stream sets from 25 independent venues across America hosted by Reggie Watts to raise $1.8 million for NIVA's efforts.
Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar was a champion on the Save our Stages act, which was co-led by Republican Senator John Cornyn, that provided $15 billion in funding to independent venues, promoters, and festivals in all 50 states and Washington D.C.“Live venues were among the first businesses to close down from the pandemic and the last to reopen. As I worked to pass the Save Our Stages Act, Dayna Frank was a crucial partner in fighting to ensure independent venues could stay afloat, including our beloved First Avenue,” Klobuchar said in a statement.Frank said of Klobuchar ""Senator Klobuchar heard our call and worked tirelessly across the aisle to pass the Save Our Stages Act. This crucial emergency funding helped us persevere through an incredibly trying time, and now I am proud to say First Avenue is open for business and serving the community we love, bringing back jobs, and welcoming fans by the tens of thousands.”


== Personal life ==
Frank is a Reform Jew.In the November 2012 election Minnesota had a statewide proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman which was defeated. During the election cycle Frank purchased a downtown Minneapolis billboard ad that read, ""Don't limit the freedom to marry. First Avenue supports same-sex marriage and equality for all people.""In 2019 President Donald Trump hosted a political rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis across the street from First Avenue. Leading up to the rally a Donald Trump baby balloon was inflated on the roof of First Avenue. When asked about the position to do so Frank informed The Hill that the business has used its venues “to give candidates on both sides a platform, including those with whom we don't agree, but the actions and policies of this administration are in direct conflict to First Avenue's core values.” “First Avenue is standing with our community, and standing up for our beliefs, letting the world know we do not accept this President's divisive rhetoric. When we were approached about hosting the balloon, we said yes,” First Avenue donated all profits earned from the concerts hosted that night to Planned Parenthood North Central States.Frank plays pickleball. She is a Women's Singles Skills Group Gold Medalist from the 2021 Twin Cities Pickleball Classic.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Born as Barbara Ann Hackman in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on March 19, 1940, to Mayme (née Haller) and Arthur A. Hackman. She attended Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania.  Prior to her graduation in 1958, she was the class valedictorian, president of the student council, captain of the field hockey and tennis teams, and a cheerleader.
In 1962, Franklin graduated from Pennsylvania State University and received its Distinguished Alumni Award in 1972. She is a sister of Kappa Alpha Theta and was its Beta Phi chapter president. At Penn State, she was the president of Mortar Board, secretary-treasurer of Pi Sigma Alpha, a member on the Liberal Arts Student Council, and a representative to the Student Government Association. Dorothy Lipp, the dean of women at Penn State, nominated Franklin for a full-scholarship to Harvard Business School, which was, for the first time, opening its doors to women and would accept one nomination from Penn State. With a partial scholarship and loans, Franklin entered the newly co-ed Harvard Business School as one of 14 women in a class of 680 men. In 1964, Franklin received her M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, and was honored with an Alumni Achievement Award in 2004.
For several years after her graduation, she worked in the corporate world. She joined the Singer Company in New York City, first in the consumer products division and then as a member of the corporate planning staff. At Singer, she became manager of environmental analysis, creating a new function that tracked competitive activity globally.

At the time, she was tasked by the CEO, Walter Wriston, to study the bank's relationships with government entities. Her analysis led to the bank's first government relations department, which she created and headed until 1971.


== Government service ==


=== Nixon administration ===
In 1971, while at the First National City Bank, Franklin was recruited by President Richard Nixon to bring more qualified women into high-level, policy-making government positions. Her appointment was part of a multi-pronged initiative by the Nixon administration following a press conference on February 6, 1969. During this press conference, Vera Glaser, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, asked President Nixon,

Mr. President, in staffing your administration, you have so far made about 200 high-level Cabinet and other policy position appointments, and of these only three have gone to women. Can you tell us, sir, whether we can expect a more equitable recognition of women's abilities, or are we going to remain a lost sex?
In February 1971, Nixon gave Fred Malek, head of Presidential Personnel and a former classmate of Franklin's at Harvard Business School, the task of hiring a woman who would spearhead the effort to recruit other women for policy-making government jobs. Malek asked Franklin to be this recruiter, and on April 12, 1971, Franklin began her position for this presidential initiative. An official press release from the White House announced Franklin on April 22, 1971, as a ""Staff Assistant to the President for Executive Manpower"" – a title that was later changed simply to ""Staff Assistant to the President"" after her first press conference, wherein the press questioned how she could recruit women with the word manpower in her title.On April 21, 1971, Nixon issued a directive to the heads of White House departments and independent agencies to create specific action plans to ""clearly demonstrate our recognition of the equality of women by making greater use of their skills in high level positions."" He required these executive departments to:

Develop and put into action a plan for attracting more qualified women to top appointive positions by the end of the year;
Develop and put into action a plan for significantly increasing the number of women, career and appointive, in mid-level positions;
Ensure the substantial numbers of the vacancies on their Advisory Boards and Committees be filled with well-qualified women; and
Designate an overall coordinator who will be held responsible for the success of the project. On each of these requirements, Nixon required the heads to submit their plans no later than May 15, 1971.Following the release of this memorandum, Franklin was charged with monitoring the implementation progress on each departments' action plans.
By April 1972, along with the other presidential initiatives, Franklin's efforts led to the tripling of the number of women placed into policy-making positions, from 36 women to 105 women, in this first year alone.  By May 1973, this number further increased to 130 women, and Franklin had created a talent bank of 1,000 qualified women for future openings. More than half of these policy-making positions to which women were appointed during this time were previously held only by men.  Among them were Cynthia Holcomb Hall, judge on the United States Tax Court; Marina von Neumann Whitman, the first woman on the president's Council of Economic Advisers;  Romana Banuelos, the first Hispanic to be U.S. treasurer; Betty Southard Murphy, general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board; and Dixy Lee Ray, the first and only woman to chair the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.At the mid-level, more than 1,000 women were advanced into many positions that women had never held before, such as sky marshals, tug boat captains, FBI agents, and forest rangers. The number of women appointed to boards and commissions increased as well, from over 250 in the first year, to 339 women by the end of May 1973. It was during this time that the first women became generals and admirals in the U.S. Armed Forces.


==== A Matter of Simple Justice ====
On March 8, 2012, the book A Matter of Simple Justice: The Untold Story of Barbara Hackman Franklin and A Few Good Women was launched at the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C., in a program covered by C-SPAN and moderated by Judy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour. The book is written by Lee Stout, Librarian Emeritus and former Head of Public Services and Outreach for Special Collections at the Penn State University Libraries. When he retired in 2007, Stout had served as Penn State's university archivist for 27 years.  In 1994, Franklin donated her governmental papers to the Penn State University Archives.  Stout was cataloging Franklin's papers when he became interested in those which detailed her service to recruit women in the Nixon administration. He called Franklin and suggested an oral history project to preserve the memories of the men and women involved in this presidential initiative.In 1997, the ""A Few Good Women"" oral history project was created with an advisory board chaired by Franklin and with a cooperative relationship with the Penn State University Libraries. Initially, the Board had a list of twelve women appointees from the Nixon administration to be interviewed, including Margita White, Constance B. Newman, and Helen Delich Bentley, former Congresswoman and Chair of the Federal Maritime Commission.  The list eventually expanded to include nearly 50 interviews, which are currently housed in the Special Collections Library at Penn State University.A Matter of Simple Justice: The Untold Story of Barbara Hackman Franklin and A Few Good Women  is based on the ""A Few Good Women"" oral history project. In a two-part format, the book first focuses primarily on the historical narrative of the Nixon administration's efforts to bring women into high-level government positions, Franklin's specific efforts, and the results of this period. In the second part of the book, Stout highlights the personal stories of many of the other interviewees from this project, such as Ambassador Anne Armstrong, Senator Elizabeth Dole, Judge Cynthia Hall, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Carla Hills. Interviewees talk about early influences, breaking down barriers, the impact on family, the role of networking, and the particular challenge of gaining entry to the legal profession.
The ""A Few Good Women"" project has received major funding from the Aetna Foundation, which has also provided grants for the ""A Few Good Women"" teaching aids project, designed by Penn State University Libraries staff. The teaching aids are designed to provide the oral histories, biographies, audio segments, images, and digitized historical documents of the ""A Few Good Women"" collection in the form of a curriculum for students in grades 6–12.


=== Consumer Product Safety Commission ===
Franklin's accomplishments as a staff assistant to President Nixon led to her nomination by Nixon as one of the first of five original commissioners of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). She was sworn in on May 14, 1973, for a term of seven years. She served under presidents Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter. On June 13, 1973, she was elected and served as the first Vice Chairman of the CPSC until 1974.  She served again as the Vice Chairman from 1977 to 1978. During these years, Franklin concentrated on improving safety for children and pioneering the use of cost/benefit analysis. Her letters to President Carter and her speeches led to that administration's creation of the United States Regulatory Council to coordinate the numerous agencies engaged in research or regulation of carcinogens, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).


=== Part-time presidential appointments ===
Prior to her appointment as Secretary of Commerce, Franklin held several part-time presidential appointment positions, including her membership of the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (1982–86; 89–91) by appointment of presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. She chaired the Task Force of Tax reform (1985–86) and was a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (1991). She was appointed by President George H. W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as an Alternative Representative & Public Delegate, UN General Assembly, 44th Session (1989–90).


=== Secretary of Commerce ===
On December 26, 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Franklin as the 29th Secretary of Commerce, replacing Robert Mosbacher.  This nomination was approved by the United States Senate and shortly thereafter she was sworn in on February 27, 1992, which made Franklin the highest-ranking woman in the George H.W. Bush administration and the 13th woman to serve in the US Cabinet.As Secretary of Commerce, she achieved a major goal: increasing American exports, most notably with China, Russia, Japan, and Mexico. She led a presidential mission to China in December 1992 for the purpose of normalizing commercial relations between the United States and China. In China, she and her counterpart, Minister Li Lanqing, reconvened the Seventh Session of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). The JCCT had been moribund since the events at Tiananmen Square in June 1989, when the U.S. placed a sanction on China banning high-level government-to-government contact. Her mission lifted that sanction and brought back $1 billion in new contracts for American companies. This mission gave a ""green light"" to U.S. companies interested in business opportunities in China, and trade with China grew dramatically in the ensuing years as did U.S. investment in China.In a letter to the editor of the New York Times published on December 29, 1992, Franklin said:
Several weeks ago President Bush asked me to lead a Presidential mission to China, following his decision to resume high-level economic talks with the Chinese. The driving rationale for the mission was to promote economic growth and jobs in the United States by insuring that American businesses have the support and opportunity to capitalize on the booming Chinese market, growing at 12 percent a year ... President Bush's policy of constructive engagement is a long-term investment in our economic future and is already delivering results in China and in the United States ... The interagency delegation I led to China and Hong Kong came back with almost $1 billion in business, and more important, we made it abundantly clear to the Chinese that they must address our concerns over the growing trade imbalance between China and the United States.
In January 1993, Franklin's appointment as Commerce Secretary ended with the inauguration of Bill Clinton to the presidency.


== Political activity ==
Franklin has been a participant in every Republican convention from 1972 to 2008 as a delegate, organizer, or speaker, and has been involved in numerous campaigns, both on the national and state levels. Franklin was an early supporter of George H. W. Bush following his bid for the 1988 nomination. She was co-chair of the national finance committee, organized outreach activities, and chaired a fundraising dinner in 1991 for his campaign that raised more than $1 million.


== Business and corporate governance ==
In 1979, Franklin was named a Senior Fellow of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.  From 1980 to 1988, she worked and lectured at the Wharton School's MBA program and served as the director of the Wharton Government and Business Program.  At Wharton, Franklin recreated a program to bring MBA candidates to Washington, D.C. as part of their course work.
Following her departure from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Franklin was offered seats on the boards of several large U.S. companies, such as Dow Chemical, Aetna, Inc., and Westinghouse. By the end of the 1980s, Franklin was on the boards of seven large companies and was cited by the American Management Association as one of the 50 most influential corporate directors in America. Franklin has served on the board of directors of 14 public companies and four private companies. She has served on every possible board committee, and has chaired six public company audit committees, two governance committees, and has served as lead director. She was non-executive chairman of Guest Services, Inc.
Currently, she is a member of the International Advisory Board of LafargeHolcim, Zurich, Switzerland. She became Chairman Emerita of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in May 2013, following the completion of a four-year term during which NACD expanded dramatically. She is Chairman Emerita of the Economic Club of New York, of which she served as the first woman chairman, and is the past president and first woman president of the Management Executives' Society.
She is a board member of the U.S.-China Business Council, a board member of the National Committee on United States – China Relations, the Atlantic Council, the Richard Nixon Foundation and the National Symphony Orchestra. She is a member of the Committee for Economic Development (CED), the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, the International Women's Forum and member emeritus of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Advisory Council.  She is a former trustee of the Pennsylvania State University and a former member of the Board of Dean's Advisors at Harvard Business School.
Franklin is a founding member of Executive Women in Government and of the Women's Forum of Washington, D.C. Franklin has been a regular commentator on international economic matters and corporate governance on national media sources, most notably PBS's Nightly Business Report.Prior to her service as Secretary of Commerce, in 1984 she founded Franklin Associates, a management and consulting firm, where she served as the president and CEO until 1992.

99,"Jane Fraser (born 1967) is a British-American banking executive who is the chief executive officer (CEO) of Citigroup, a position she has held since March 2021. Educated at Girton College, Cambridge, and Harvard Business School, she worked at McKinsey & Company for 10 years, rising to partner prior to joining Citigroup in 2004. In 2019, she was named president of Citigroup and CEO of its consumer banking division.In September 2020, Citigroup announced that she would replace Michael Corbat as CEO of Citigroup Inc. in February 2021, becoming the first woman to head a major U.S. bank. She was included on Fortune's ""Most Powerful Women in Business"" list in 2014 and 2015 and has been called the ""Number 1 Woman to Watch"" for two consecutive years by American Banker.


== Early life and education ==
Jane Fraser was born in St Andrews, Scotland. She attended Girton College, Cambridge, from 1985 to 1988, graduating with a BA (promoted to a MA per tradition) in economics.After graduation, she worked as a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Goldman Sachs, London, from July 1988 to July 1990, then as a brokerage associate for Asesores Bursátiles, a Madrid-based securities broker, from August 1990 to June 1992. In 1992 she enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning her MBA in 1994.


== McKinsey & Company ==

In 1994 she joined McKinsey & Company, working in financial services and global strategy, eventually rising to partner. For the first six years she worked in New York, and for the last four years in London. She worked part-time while raising her young children.She wrote articles on globalization and was a co-author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm. As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges. After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004.


== Citigroup ==
Fraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004. In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009. Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007–2009, and she was part of the executive team that was ""charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital"".
In June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank. At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure. Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus.In May 2013 she was asked to replace the retiring CEO of CitiMortgage. Though she knew the move was a career risk, she accepted the challenge. Her stewardship of Citigroup's mortgage division coincided with the marketwide drop in demand for mortgage refinancing, forcing the bank to refocus its efforts on selling residential mortgages to home buyers. Citigroup closed several mortgage offices nationwide and laid off 1,000 employees in September 2013 alone.Less than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement. And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America, with responsibility for operations in 24 countries. The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank. Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America. While based in Miami, Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, ""instilling a more U.S.-like culture"" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de México), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001. The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014. The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser.In October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB), and was responsible for all of Citi’s Consumer businesses, including Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Operations and Technology in 19 markets.


=== Promotion to CEO and tenure ===
In September 2020, Citigroup announced its CEO, Michael Corbat's retirement, to be effective in February 2021. Fraser was appointed to succeed Corbat, becoming the first female CEO of a top-tier Wall Street Investment Bank, leading the third-largest bank in the U.S.
Fraser has taken an approach to work during the COVID-19 pandemic that differs from peer CEOs, instituting permanent plans to allow staff to work from home some days of the week, and granting staff greater flexibility in their schedules than other Wall Street firms. She has cited differentiating Citigroup from other bulge bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase during recruiting as a motivation for this approach.Fraser is scheduled to speak at the November 2022 Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, with the Hong Kong Democracy Council claiming that her presence, along with other financial executives, legitimizes the Hong Kong government's whitewashing of the erosion of freedoms in the city.


== Memberships ==
Fraser is Vice Chair for Partnership for New York City and a member of the Harvard Business School’s Board of Dean’s Advisors, the Stanford Global Advisory Board, the Economic Club of New York and the Council on Foreign Relations. Fraser has led the Citi Operations team since 2021. She was also a member of the board of the Touch Foundation from 2006 to 2015.


== Honours and recognition ==
In 2015 Fraser was ranked number 41 on Fortune's list of the 51 Most Powerful Women in Business, up from number 48 on the 2014 list. American Banker named her the ""Number 1 Woman to Watch"" both in 2014 and 2015.Fraser was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.


== Personal ==
Fraser is married and the mother of two sons. Her husband Alberto Piedra, a former banker, and native of Cuba, left his job as a bank manager in Europe during the financial crisis of 2008 to spend more time caring for their young children. In June 2015 Fraser appeared on a CBS Local report about Citi Global Community Day, in which she and other volunteers spruced up the Liberty Square public housing project in Miami.In April 2021, during her first televised interview as CEO of Citigroup (on CNBC), Fraser disclosed that despite the [British] accent, she had ""been a proud American [citizen] for the last twenty years"".In May 26, 2021, during a congressional testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Fraser noted in her opening remarks as CEO of Citigroup, that she first arrived in the United States in 1987, before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001.

== Career ==
In 1982, after being treated rudely in a routine call to her insurance agent, Friedman both canceled her policies and started the ""desk drawer"" one-woman business Telephone Doctor to train employees in telephone etiquette. The insurer company asked ""how it should be done"" and invited Friedman to demonstrate polite customer service to its representatives, leading to Friedman providing customer-service seminars to other corporations and associations. Friedman's first seminar earned 38 cents in profit. ""Telephone Doctor"" was named by Friedman's second client, a Davenport, Iowa newspaper editor.The company, Telephone Doctor, was founded by Friedman in 1983. By 1986, her business, co-owned with her husband, Dick Friedman and her son, David, was a subsidiary of Weatherline and Sportsline. By 1987, she was doing three to four seminars a week.

Also in 1994, the company acquired World Telecom Associates.The company also did surveys to find out what phrases frustrated callers the most. Friedman tried going on television to increase her business's exposure, but later found that creating close relationships with clients worked better for her type of business. In 2007, the company made $3 million.Friedman's desire to teach businesses how to make better use of the telephone rather than to take it for granted has been called a ""crusade"" and a ""quest to stamp out phone rudeness"".

102,"Veronica Froman-Blue, better known by her maiden name Veronica ""Ronne"" Froman (RADM, USN, Ret.), is an American retired naval officer. She was the first woman to serve as commander of the United States Navy Region Southwest, a position known as the ""Navy Mayor of San Diego"". She retired from the Navy in 2001 with the rank of rear admiral, after a 31-year career.
Following her retirement she took on several high-profile civilian positions in San Diego, California: chief of business operations for the San Diego Unified School District; CEO of the local chapter of the American Red Cross; and the first Chief Operating Officer for the city of San Diego. She is a strong supporter of the Monarch School, a public school for homeless youth; she is the past CEO and chairman of the school's board of directors and still serves on the board.


== Military career ==
Froman was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Seton Hill College. She received a Navy commission in 1970 as a General Unrestricted Line Officer. When she retired in 2001 as a rear admiral (two-star admiral), she was one of the highest-ranking female officers in the Navy. During her military career the role of women in the Navy was greatly expanded.  ""When I joined, we (women) couldn't go to sea; we didn't have command; there were no lady admirals"", she said in 2009. ""It kind of evolved over the years I was in the Navy.""Her assignments during her 31-year career included commanding the Navy's Southwest Region from 1997 until 2000. She was the first woman to hold that position. The command supports Navy shore installations in six western states and is headquartered in San Diego. The commander of the Southwest Region is often referred to as the ""Navy Mayor of San Diego"". At the time the Southwest Region employed approximately 86,000 sailors and 35,000 civilians. There were 56 ships, five submarines and 600 aircraft home-ported in the region.She also served two high-level assignments at the Pentagon, including Director of Shore Readiness for the Chief of Naval Operations from 2000 to 2001. During her time on active duty she received the U.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the United States Navy Distinguished Service Medal.


== Civilian career ==
Following her retirement from the Navy she settled in San Diego. She served as chief of business operations for the San Diego Unified School District from 2001 till 2003. She is credited with trimming millions of dollars from district business operations during that time.In 2003 she became CEO of the San Diego–Imperial Counties chapter of the American Red Cross. She was recruited to that position by chapter chairman Jerry Sanders to restore the unit's reputation and credibility. The chapter had come under heavy criticism because of controversy over the use of funds donated for the relief of victims of a 2001 wildfire. She instituted changes in accountability and transparency which earned praise when the region was again struck by fire in 2003.In 2005 Sanders ran for mayor of San Diego in a special election, promising that if elected he would appoint Froman as his second-in-command. When he took office in January 2006 he appointed her as the first-ever Chief Operating Officer of the city, with functions similar to a city manager. She resigned in June 2007 and took a position as senior vice president for the energy group of General Atomics.She has had a longtime interest in homeless issues and particularly in the Monarch School, a public K-12 school for students who are at risk or actually impacted by homelessness. She served on the school project's board of directors since 2004 and served as interim vice president of the public-private partnership. In July 2011 she took over as CEO of the nonprofit organization. In January 2012 she became chairman of the organization's board of directors.Since 2010 she has been the CEO and chair of REBOOT, a program to help military veterans transition to civilian life. She has several times served as the honorary chair of San Diego Fleet Week.


== Personal life ==
She is married to Linden Blue, co-owner of General Atomics.

Fu has related in interviews and in her memoir that she chose to research China's one-child policy for her thesis and traveled to the countryside, where she found that infanticide of female infants was common, as was abortion, even late into pregnancy.  Fu said that, after turning in her research, she believes it was passed to a newspaper editor who wrote an editorial on the infanticide of female children. Fu has stated that she was later briefly imprisoned by government officials and was told to leave the country. After this event, she left school, without graduating.Fu left China and arrived in the United States in January 1984. She initially enrolled at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque but later moved to San Diego to study computer science as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. During her time in San Diego, Fu worked part-time at a software company called Resource Systems Group as a programmer and database software consultant. Following her graduation from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in computer science, she moved to Illinois, where she took a job with Bell Labs. The company offered a Ph.D assistance program, through which Fu enrolled in the computer science Ph.D program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). At UIUC she completed a master's degree in computer science.


== Career ==


=== National Center for Supercomputing Applications ===
In the early 1990s, Fu began working at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at UIUC. Her focus was on computer graphics and visualization, including projects such as developing the morphing software for animation of the liquid metal T-1000 robot in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. While at NCSA, she hired student researcher Marc Andreessen and was his supervisor on the project developing NCSA's Mosaic, an early multimedia web browser credited with popularizing the World Wide Web. According to her supervisor, Joseph Hardin, Fu was one of the managers involved in the discussions from which the idea for the browser was developed. In 1994 Ping took a temporary position at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, returning to NCSA in 1995.


=== Geomagic ===
In 1996, Marc Andreessen's success with his own company, Netscape, inspired UIUC to encourage entrepreneurship and Fu developed the idea for a company that would combine manufacturing and digital technology, including 3D modeling software, the concept of which she called the ""Personal Factory"". She founded Geomagic with her then-husband, Herbert Edelsbrunner, whose research formed the basis for the initial software to be developed by the company. In 1997, she left the NCSA to begin operations at Geomagic, taking on the role of CEO. The company was originally named Raindrop Geomagic and was based in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. It was founded with the aim of developing 3D imaging software that could enable customized manufacturing using 3D printers. Initially, Fu and Edelsbrunner funded Geomagic themselves, along with investment from Fu's sister Hong and her husband, and later from a group of angel investors.In 1999, Fu relocated Geomagic from Illinois to the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. That year, Franklin Street Partners committed to invest $6.5 million in Geomagic. Fu then hired an experienced executive as CEO who ran Geomagic for two years before stepping down when the company was close to bankruptcy. Fu returned to the role of CEO in 2001, investing her own money into Geomagic and working without a salary in order to continue paying the company's employees. She was able to lead Geomagic back to stability, gaining a significant contract with Align Technology, and Geomagic returned to profitability over the following two years.From 2001 to 2003, Geomagic's sales tripled under Fu's leadership. The company became known as a leader in digital shape sampling and processing. After she and Edelsbrunner divorced, he continued to serve as an advisor at Geomagic.In February 2013, Fu sold Geomagic to 3D Systems Corporation, a 3D printing company. She became the Chief Strategy Officer and Vice-President of 3D Systems.


=== Other roles ===
In addition to leading Geomagic, Fu has held a number of advisory roles relating to technology and entrepreneurship and with charitable organizations. She has served on the U.S. National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship since 2010 and is also a member of the National Council on Women in Technology. In 2012, she was appointed to the board of the Long Now Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on long-term thinking and enduring technology. She also serves on the board of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina, the board of Live Nation Entertainment and is an advisor at Modern Meadow, an organization focused on tissue engineering.


== Memoir ==

On December 31, 2012, Fu published a memoir, Bend, Not Break: A Life in Two Worlds. Co-authored with MeiMei Fox, the book told the stories of her life, from her early childhood in China to her experiences as an entrepreneur, including founding and leading Geomagic. The book received positive reviews from outlets including The Wall Street Journal and Oprah.com.Beginning in January 2013, commentors in the Amazon.com reviews for the memoir began posting critical reviews, accusing Fu of lying about events in her past. Around the same time, first in English,  then in Chinese  on Forbes China, Forbes published an interview with Fu that discussed Fu's memoir and her early life, which contained an inaccurate interpretation of where Ping Fu lived during the cultural revolution. Chinese netizens responded to the piece with criticisms regarding alleged fabrication of events and inconsistencies in media coverage of Fu, which raised questions in the media about the veracity of details included in the memoir. Chinese blogger Fang Zhouzi was among the critics and he later raised further questions and criticisms based on earlier media coverage of Fu. Following the initial criticisms from Fang Zhouzi and other critics, commentors appearing to be non-native English speakers knowledgeable about Chinese history posted hundreds of negative comments in the memoir's Amazon.com reviews, leading The Daily Beast and New York Times   to conclude that Ping was the subject of an online attack.Fu responded to the criticisms through a public statement, and a post on the Huffington Post website answering questions that were raised about her childhood, education and being forced to leave China. She acknowledged that there were some inaccuracies in the book. She also acknowledged that the Red Guard atrocity she related in the memoir and media interviews regarding a teacher being pulled apart by four horses may have been an emotional memory, the result of hearing tales of such barbarity in old China as a child and having nightmares about it, or seeing it in a movie, rather than actually seeing it. In response to questions about accuracy of details in the book, her publisher stated that the book is a memoir, rather than a journalistic account of the Cultural Revolution. Fu has said that a second print of the memoir will correct inaccuracies that have been pointed out.


== Awards and recognitions ==
For her work with Geomagic, Fu has received a number of awards. In 2003 she was named the Ernst & Young ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" for the Carolinas and received the Entrepreneurial Inspiration Award from North Carolina's Council for Entrepreneurial Development. The following year, Fast Company named her a 2004 ""Fast 50"" winner. In 2005, Inc. magazine named Ping its ""Entrepreneur of the Year"".The America China Business Women’s Alliance awarded Fu its ""Business Innovation Award"" in 2008 and she received the 2010 ""Leadership Award"" from the CAD Society. The next year, she was given a ""Lifetime Achievement"" award by the Triangle Business Journal. In 2011 she was given the William C. Friday Award at North Carolina State University, and in 2012, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services named Fu as an ""Outstanding American by Choice"".

She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, ""What are you really here for? What do you really want to accomplish?""'

She was the principal investigator on the National Institutes of Health Human Polycystic Kidney Disease research grant, which ran from 1985 to 1999, and defined the clinical manifestations and genetics of the disease in adults and children. She served for two decades as CEO of Denver Health, an integrated public healthcare system in Denver, Colorado, where she implemented numerous business-based systems to streamline operations, improve patient care, and recognize cost savings. In particular, her introduction of the ""Lean"" quality-improvement system, based on the Toyota Production System, earned her national recognition. She is the author of more than 150 articles and book chapters, three books, and has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching, physician care, and leadership. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2004.


== Early life and education ==
Patricia Anne Acquaviva was born in January 1944 to an Italian-American family. Her parents, Pat Acquaviva and Terese Colonna Acquaviva, married in 1942. Her father, a private first class in the US army, was killed in action in March 1945 during the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine, after which she and her mother moved in with her uncle and grandparents. Her mother, a teacher, remarried to James R. Helmintoller in 1951.She earned her B.S. in biology at Seton Hill College in 1965. She received her M.D. at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969.


== Academic career ==
After interning in medicine for one year at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, she undertook a one-year residency in internal medicine at Harbor General Hospital in 1970. This was followed by one-year renal fellowships at San Francisco General Hospital and the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1973 Gabow joined Denver Health and Hospitals to establish its nephrology department. She began as an instructor in the Division of Renal Diseases at the University of Colorado, advancing to a full professorship in 1987.
