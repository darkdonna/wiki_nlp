== Controversies ==
On 15 September 2010 Anastase headed the meeting of the Chamber when the pension bill passed. As chairman of the meeting, when putting the bill to the vote, she counted the deputies, stating that the quorum was reached, although there were only 80 deputies present - and therefore that the bill passed. According to Ms. Anastase, more than 160 deputies voted, even 270. The National Liberal Party (PNL) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) groups had previously left the session and thus refrained from voting. On 6 October 2010 the Constitutional Court rejected the appeals filed by PNL and PSD and declared the law constitutional. President Traian Băsescu returned the law for a new debate to the Parliament, but for other reasons than those claimed by the opposition.On 3 July 2012, after the political majority in the parliament had changed when several members of the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) ruling party migrated to other parties (especially to the Social Liberal Union, USL), Roberta Anastase was revoked from the position of President of the Chamber of Deputies and was replaced by Valeriu Zgonea (PSD).

1,"Ecaterina Andronescu (Romanian pronunciation: [ekateˈrina androˈnesku]; born 7 April 1948) is a Romanian engineer, professor, and politician. A member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), she sat in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies from 1996 to 2008, representing Bucharest, and was a Senator from 2008 until 2020, for the same city. In the Adrian Năstase cabinet, she was Education Minister from 2000 until June 2003. She held the same position in the cabinet of Emil Boc from 2008 to 2009, in the Victor Ponta cabinet during 2012, and finally in the Viorica Dăncilă cabinet for under 9 months between November 2018 and August 2019. She is married and has one child.


== Biography ==


=== Background and first ministerial position ===
She was born in Malovăț, Mehedinți County and became an engineer in 1972 upon graduation from the Oxidic Materials Science and Engineering department of the Politehnica University of Bucharest's Industrial Chemistry Faculty. In 1982, she earned a doctorate in the same field, and pursued further studies in Western Europe in the 1990s. From 1972 to 1983, she was an assistant lecturer at Politehnica, then lecturer from 1983 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994 she was a reader there, and she has been a professor at the same institution since 1994. From 1989 to 1992, she was assistant dean of the Industrial Chemistry Faculty, and dean from 1992 to 2004. She became the university's rector in 2004, serving until 2012. She has published over 155 scientific works in specialty journals in Romania and abroad; had over 60 scientific research contracts, including abroad; published three books; and has been awarded a patent.In 1996, Andronescu joined the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR; PSD since 2001). She had been a secretary of state at the Education Ministry since the preceding year, and at the autumn 1996 elections (which the PDSR lost), she gained a seat in the Chamber and left the ministry. Until 2000, she was secretary of its committee on education, science and youth, continuing as a member until 2008. Re-elected in 2000, she was appointed to the incoming Năstase cabinet, serving until 2003, when Alexandru Athanasiu replaced her.As minister, she took a number of controversial decisions, including the reintroduction of a required examination for entering university faculties; changing of the modality of admission to high schools; and a change in the method for correcting the baccalaureate. Critics charged that these ""experiments"" had introduced ""anachronism and chaos"" into the Romanian educational system, perturbing both pupils and teachers, and Andronescu's reputed inability to justify and sustain her decisions earned her the nickname of Abramburica (a coined term mixing abracadabra and brambura, ""aimless"").


=== Opposition and return to government ===
She was again elected to the Chamber in 2004, and to the Senate in 2008. During the latter campaign, she charged the incumbent National Liberal Party (PNL) government with immorality, corruption and incompetence regarding education, and touted her 2001–2003 efforts to introduce computers into classrooms and build gyms; these two programmes were themselves criticised at the end of 2004, after the PSD had been voted out of office, for the computerisation effort's weak results and for both having been undertaken after no-bid contracts worth tens of millions of dollars. Additionally, during 2008, she initiated a law raising teachers' salaries by 50%; this measure won unanimous parliamentary approval.Following her election to the Senate, where she served on the culture committee until 2010, also becoming vice president of the education committee in 2009, she was named Education Minister once again. During this cabinet stint, Andronescu again attracted controversy. In May 2009, the authors of the nationwide high school admission test made two errors when writing the questions, prompting the resignation of two Education Ministry employees, and contributing to worries among PSD leaders that Andronescu was damaging their party's image. She later indicated a willingness to scrap the test in its current form, citing unpopularity among teachers. That July, she announced her ministry would no longer issue diplomas for the private Spiru Haret University (and might seek its outright closure), claiming that institution had failed to undergo accreditation and authorisation for its offerings. This action reportedly displeased PSD president Mircea Geoană for not being cleared with him in advance; the university itself took the government to court and won the right to continue operations.She worked on pushing a new educational code through Parliament, but the PSD's former government partner, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), has its own proposals; despite her expressed wish, the debate became entangled in the autumn presidential campaign, where the parties are supporting rival candidates. In September, Prime Minister Boc threatened Andronescu with dismissal if she did not annul an order allowing the Education Minister (as opposed to school inspectors) the power to change school directors; she countered that this would decrease the politicisation of the process, while Geoană commented that Boc alone could not dismiss her without consulting his party. Boc's move followed rising discontent with her within the PDL, whose members Ioan Oltean and Radu Berceanu suggested that Andronescu herself was trying to politicise the educational process. The PDL also suggested that Andronescu's proposals aimed at sabotaging Boc's own reform project, which the party claimed was addressing the fundamental issues. Together with her PSD colleagues, Andronescu resigned from the cabinet on 1 October 2009, in protest at the dismissal of vice prime minister and Interior Minister Dan Nica. Boc himself took over her ministry, on an interim basis.


=== Plagiarism controversy and subsequent developments ===
In July 2012, Andronescu became Education Minister a third time, appointed by Prime Minister Ponta. When President Traian Băsescu signed off on her appointment, he requested that she confirm she had not plagiarized her doctoral thesis. This came amid a backdrop of plagiarism scandals that, among other effects, had forced her predecessor Ioan Mang to resign. Andronescu, although finding the request ""demeaning"" for her professional career, declared she had never committed plagiarism. That November, integru.org, a Romanian website run by anonymous academics and focused on plagiarism detection charged that for a 2003 article, Andronescu and her co-author had lifted significant passages without attribution from three other works. The allegations were published by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung; in response, the minister stated that her actions did not amount to plagiarism. Also in the same period, an article in Nature charged she had signed off on a plagiarized €500,000 research funding request; she denied ever having signed the document. A third incident arose over an article published, with minor differences, four times between 2006 and 2007; integru.org alleged that Andronescu, whose name appeared on the authors' list the last three times but not the first, plagiarized the first group of authors. At the December election, she retained her Senate seat with a nationwide high of 68%, but was not reappointed to Ponta's cabinet when it formed later in the month. In the Senate, she has served as president of the education committee since 2012. At the 2014 European Parliament election, she won a seat as an MEP. However, Ponta, as party chief, persuaded her not to take office, saying she was too important domestically to be permitted a job abroad. She was returned to the Senate at the 2016 parliamentary election.Within her party, Andronescu has held several posts since 1997: vice-president of its Bucharest chapter; member of the central executive bureau; member of the national council; vice president, since 2010; and interim president of its Bucharest chapter, since 2012. In 2002, she was made a Knight of the Order of the Star of Romania. The following year, she became a corresponding member of the Baia Mare Technical Academy. She holds honorary doctorates from five Romanian universities.


=== Fourth Minister of Education term ===
Following the resignation of Valentin Popa after a controversy regarding the teaching of the Romanian language in areas with Hungarian ethnic majorities, Andronescu was nominated for a fourth time to occupy the Education Ministry. She was removed from office on 2 August 2019 by prime minister Viorica Dăncilă following a controversial statement that ""young girls should know better than to get in cars with strangers"" regarding the kidnapping of Alexandra Măceșanu and Luiza Melencu.

3,"Mitzura Domnica Arghezi (also spelled Mițura, born Domnica Theodorescu; 10 December 1924 – 27 October 2015) was a Romanian actress, visual artist and politician, also active as a ballerina, book editor, and museum curator. She was the daughter of poet-journalist Tudor Arghezi, the sister of writer Baruțu T. Arghezi, as well as the half-sister of art photographer Eli Lotar. Her childhood was spent at Mărțișor, her father's estate in Bucharest, and became the inspiration for his children's books, which a grown-up Mitzura illustrated. She was trained in dancing by Floria Capsali, and appeared in music shows for both the National Opera and the National Theater Bucharest. During and shortly after World War II, she exhibited her work in the graphic arts, to critical acclaim. Mitzura's career in both visual arts and letters was interrupted by her family's persecution in the early stages of Romanian communism. Deemed a child ""of the bourgeoisie"" by Scînteia, she was forced to renounce her studies at the University of Bucharest and focus instead on becoming an actress. She graduated from the Caragiale Institute of Theater just as Arghezi Sr was undergoing rehabilitation.
Debuting on the screen with the 1951 In Our Village, Arghezi returned ten years later with a leading role in Doi vecini—based on a comedic story by her father, and marking the directorial debut of her Institute colleague Geo Saizescu. This was followed in 1964 by another substantial role, as Gena in Titanic Waltz. Though she continued to appear in films and was part of the National Theater company, from 1967 she became mainly focused on preserving her late father's legacy, and by 1975 was in charge of Mărțișor, reopened as a museum. Following Baruțu's self-exile and Lotar's death, she took full managerial control of the estate, sparking controversy with her rigid interpretation of copyright, and being accused of stealing others' research in her own work as editor of the Tudor Arghezi corpus. She was also criticized for her alleged compromises with communist governments, and, into her old age, remained adamant that Romania under socialism was preferable to the United States.
Despite being part-Székely, Arghezi was an advocate of Romanian nationalism, and repeatedly voiced suspicion toward the Hungarian minority. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, she entered electoral politics with Corneliu Vadim Tudor's Greater Romania Party (PRM); for several months in 1995, she was the inaugural holder of a government secretariat channeling support for the Romanian diaspora. She was elected to the Chamber for Olt County in the general election of 1996, and reelected in 2000 (when she was also the first woman to preside over a Chamber session). Openly calling for a ban on the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, she was also an opponent of the then-governing Romanian Democratic Convention. Defending the PRM's image as a moderate-nationalist force, Arghezi expressed support for European integration and spoke about her father's philosemitism, while remaining loyal to Vadim Tudor throughout the PRM's decline and factional splits. She died in 2015, weeks after Vadim Tudor's own death, and was buried at Mărțișor amid a controversy surrounding her inheritance.


== Biography ==


=== Origins and early life ===
Arghezi was born in Bucharest on 10 December 1924. Her father was Tudor Arghezi, by then a nationally famous writer, who celebrated her birth with the poem Cântec de adormit Mitzura (""A Song for Rocking Mitzura to Sleep""), and composed a new lyrical piece for each of her birthdays. Her mother, Paraschiva, hailing from a rural family of Bukovina Romanians, was Arghezi's second wife. Specifically, she and her sister Saveta (""Tătana"") were from the Burda clan of yeomen, hailing from either Bunești or Pleșești. They had been orphaned early on, after both their parents died of food poisoning. Paraschiva and Tudor's other child, Iosif ""Baruțu"", was born on 28 December 1925; as observed later by their family friend Constantin Beldie, the couple had been married for 15 years before having either child, who therefore risked being ""spoiled"" by their loving parents. Tudor had been married to Constanța Zissu, from whom he had another son, Eliazar Theodorescu. At exactly the moment of Mitzura's birth, Eliazar had rebelled against his upbringing, leaving Romania to try his luck in France, and establishing his fame there as photographer-filmmaker ""Eli Lotar"".
Tudor and his immediate family were only officially registered as ""Arghezi"" from April 1956; though Mitzura took the famous surname, in a 2002 she referred to it as a ""sweet burden"", which had always seen her compared to her father. Throughout her life, she supported Romanian nationalism, presenting Arghezi Sr as a ""good Romanian"", and being herself critical of Romania's Hungarian community. On her father's side, she had ethnically diverse origins. These were long obscured by Arghezi Sr, and only became accessible after archival research in the 1970s. Records brought up at the time indicate that Tudor was born out of wedlock to the Romanian pastry-maker Nae Theodorescu, originally from Oltenia, and took his surname. Tudor's mother, Rozalia, was a domestic servant from Transylvania (at the time in Austria-Hungary), who also had children from other relationships; one of them was the lawyer Alexandru Arghezi Pârvulescu, who in 1975 revealed that ""Arghezi"" was also Rozalia's original surname, and not a literary pseudonym invented by her son. Rozalia gave her ethnic origin as ""German"", reporting that she had converted from Catholicism to Romanian Orthodoxy—though various of her contemporaries already knew her as a Hungarian, and more specifically a Székely, who had taught her sons to speak her native language. In 2015, journalist István Ferenczes discovered her birth certificate as ""Rozalia Ergézi"" of Vlăhița, further establishing her origin among the Székelys of Bukovina.Domnica spent her earliest years at Mărțișor, an estate that her father had bought and developed in Văcărești, southern Bucharest, in 1926. This new home was only completely built in 1931, after Arghezi Sr had drained a swamp and extended a paved road. Mitzura and her two brothers were all partly raised by their paternal grandmother Rozalia, who lived with them at Mărțișor; he was noticeably discreet when introducing her, leading some of his close friends to assume that she was a governess, rather than the children's grandmother. After his youngest no longer required her services, Tudor forced his mother to move out of the house and into a rented apartment, or, according to Beldie, a monastery. The latter author was once told by Mitzura that Rozalia was Arghezi's stepmother, and was thus punished for having mistreated Tudor in his childhood; she also reported that Alexandru had been similarly shunned by the ""Arghezi tribe"" for speaking ill of them. Beldie notes that another one of Nae Theodorescu's wives, a Greek-Romanian, was on good terms with the family, and gave Mitzura her first lessons in English.As reported by Mitzura herself, the writer loved both of his youngest children, and made them the literary subjects of his Book of Toys, which recounts his fascination with their early development; the book was much criticized by Beldie, who found that its only possible readers were housewives. However, he praised Arghezi Sr for not overindulging his children and for ultimately allowing his ""anarchic"" worldview to inform his approach to child-rearing. The father's affection is recorded in a September 1927 letter he sent to his patron A. L. Zissu from Râșnov, where he was vacationing when Mitzura was struck by an illness. As he confesses therein: ""I was no longer able to write down just one line until today, when the light of her eyes shone again, when she could smile again"". Creating his own printing press in Văcărești, he conceived early on of a plan to have Mitzura train as his illustrator, and Baruțu as a typographer. His method was also anti-literary; as he explained in 1935, he never read to his children, since ""literature is a strictly intimate thing"". As noted by literary historian Mircea Zaciu, Mitzura was always less educated than her father: while Arghezi Sr, who had spent time in Switzerland, used competent French in his correspondence, Mitzura's French letters were ""puerile [and] immature"", as well as ungrammatical.Both Theodorescu children had an early start in the arts, with Baruțu publishing his first work of prose in 1939. Mitzura worked for a while in the ballet troupe of the National Opera, and appeared in shows staged by Floria Capsali, with whom she was already training in 1943. She ultimately gave up on this career path because, as she put it, ""the life of a dancer is very constrained."" Though ""known primarily as a ballerina and actress"", she also debuted as a visual artist, with ink drawings that were taken up by a Bucharest magazine during the same period. Writer and Orthodox clergyman Valeriu Anania, who visited Mărțișor during the 1950s, recalls its walls being decorated with her engravings. In April 1943, at the height of World War II, fifteen of her sketches were exhibited with the Grupul Grafic artists' society, and were positively reviewed by Ion Frunzetti. Frunzetti argued that she had found perfection in line art and animal drawing, especially with her ""delicious panorama"" of domestic life. In later musings on these events, Baruțu argued that Grupul's Dimitrie Dimitriu-Nicolaide was the one who approached his sister to have her featured in the show. As he notes, Dimitriu and his colleagues were ""at odds"" with the fascist aesthetics promoted by Romania's wartime Conducător, Ion Antonescu.


=== Marginalization and recovery ===
Soon after, Mitzura's father began openly questioning Romania's participation in the war as an ally of Nazi Germany, and enraged Antonescu with his satirical prose, in which he had targeted Ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger. As Baruțu reported in 1960, the definitive attack on Killinger was first read to a family-only audience, including Mitzura; upon hearing it, Paraschiva exclaimed: iar ți s-a făcut de pușcărie (""it seems you're itching to get back behind bars""). This work in fact resulted in his brief internment at Târgu Jiu. Mitzura and Paraschiva visited him there in October 1943, and found themselves treated with unusual respect by the local Land Forces garrison, whose staff had quietly endorsed Arghezi's patriotic take-down of Nazism.The returning poet was openly celebrated during the interlude which followed Antonescu's toppling in August 1944. At the time, the Romanian Communist Party, backed by the Soviet Union and its occupation forces, was experiencing an increase in influence. In February 1945, the communist ideologue Miron Radu Paraschivescu accused the writer of having backed the fascist Iron Guard, and of having embraced anti-Sovietism, noting that the Killinger incident was uncharacteristic. According to Paraschivescu, Eli Lotar, who had embraced ""revolutionary"" ideas and had deserted his family, was ""T. Arghezi's first son—his first, and not just chronologically."" Other communists were considering Arghezi Sr as an external ally. By August, contacts between the party and the Arghezis were mediated by Radu Bogdan of Scînteia; as he recalled in a 1993 piece, the effort was doomed: ""Every person in that home, including Lady Paraschiva, Tătana (her sister), Mițura and Baruțu, not to mention the writer himself, were stunned by the occupation army and its behavior [...]. The family's hopes were directed exclusively toward the Anglo-Americans"". For a while, the attempts at a rapprochement did not yet subside. In December 1946, a banquet was hosted in the writer's honor by the Ministry of Culture, headed at the time by Mihai Ralea. Performances included a dance number by Mitzura.Mitzura was by then appearing as a backing dancer in Marin Iorda's version of Scapin the Schemer at Giulești Workers' Theatre—that institution's inaugural production. Overseen by Capsali, she and her fellow ballerinas were praised by Tudor Șoimaru in Adevărul as ""agile and graceful"". Her return as an illustrator had occurred earlier that year, when she designed the cover for the Romanian edition of Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows. Her drawings and one watercolor were showcased at an independent exhibit at Căminul Artei of Bucharest. They earned her encouragement from art critic George Oprescu, who found her drawings reminiscent of Henri Matisse and Nicolae Tonitza, ""that which is not a bad thing."" Such work was continued in early 1947, when Editura Socec issued Tudor Arghezi's Țara Piticilor (""Land of the Dwarfs"") with his daughter's vignettes. On Christmas Day, Arghezi Sr completed another cherished project by working with his two children on a self-published, artisanal, booklet, Drumul cu povești (""A Pathway of Stories"")—it retains value as a collectible item. In June 1948, Mitzura and Baruțu, alongside Cora Benador and others, appeared in a ballet recital at the National Theater Bucharest.During the early years of Romanian communism, introduced as a people's democracy in early 1948, Tudor Arghezi was lambasted in Scînteia editorials penned by Sorin Toma. Toma depicted him as a voice of decadent literature; one episode of his expose discussed Arghezi's belief in vitality as a principle in educating his own children. The article suggested that the very notion displayed Arghezi's preaching of individualism, against the ""preservation of collective life"", and that it fit well with raising his son and daughter as ""children of the bourgeoisie"". The writer was then virtually banished by the censorship apparatus. These circumstances were aggravated after December 1948, when Baruțu used the family's printing press to publish an anticommunist manifesto—he was arrested in 1949, and held in custody until 1950, when his father successfully negotiated his release with the nomenklatura. At this stage, the family was reduced to living from unusual sources of income, including cherries from the orchard, that Tudor Arghezi would sell to passers-by. According to Anania, this commercial activity was also embraced by Mitzura and Baruțu.In 1951, Mitzura had a small, uncredited part in the film In Our Village. Initially, she followed the literary path. Enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, she was expelled due to political pressures in 1948. She was allowed to study at the Caragiale Institute of Theater, after reciting a Soviet poem in front of the examination board, which included Aura Buzescu. She went on to perform in a variety of small parts at the National Theater, but had to skip a year due to her poor health. By 1953, she was in the same class as the aspiring director Geo Saizescu, who greatly admired her father; as noted by Saizescu, she remained ""rather skimpy on details regarding [his] earthly sufferings"". Some records suggest that she was originally enlisted in the Institute's film section, and only later transferred to the drama section.
From 1955, Arghezi Sr agreed to participate in communist propaganda, and was admitted into the regime's literary community. According to diary entries by his anti-communist friend Petre Pandrea, this pact was sealed due to material constraints, and in large part because of Mitzura's persistent pleas. Also according to Pandrea, this change of status allowed Mitzura, who had been married once before, to begin her second marriage, to a fellow actor whom he does not name. The wedding, which took place somewhere in Oltenia in October 1956, was a lavish affair with over 1,000 guests and a ""strictly Orthodox ceremony""—since, despite the officially endorsed atheism, the major cultural affiliates were now allowed publicized exceptions. She had moved out of the family home the previous year, and spent time at various addresses. In 1964, she and her family moved to Dorobanți, in a recently nationalized townhouse on Grigore Cerchez Street.


=== Artistic and editorial fame ===
Censorship also became more lenient by 1957, around the time of her graduation. Mitzura Arghezi had begun work as a voice actress with the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company, including with a rendition of Mihail Sebastian's Jocul de-a vacanța, for which she recorded alongside Radu Beligan, Dina Cocea and Colea Răutu. The following year, a new edition of the Book of Toys came out, at Editura Tineretului, and featured her drawings as illustrations. Mitzura received positive notice for her role as one of The Neighbors in Federico García Lorca's The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife—a January 1959 production at the National Theater, which saw her sharing the stage with Draga Olteanu and Eliza Plopeanu. In that context, she invited Saizescu to Mărțișor, where he and Tudor Arghezi discussed a film project. These talks resulted in the 1961 comedy film Doi vecini, which was submitted by Saizescu for the completion of his film degree, and which featured Mitzura in her second film credit. In 1964, she was given a major role in Titanic Waltz, as Gena. She noted her overall disappointment with this career choice, recalling her father's warning that the acting career ""will bring one few satisfactions [...] if there's no one to support you, if you're not a director's wife, a manager's wife, this and that man's girlfriend, there's no way forward, you can be as gifted as can be, there will still be two parts for women and ten for men"".During the early 1960s, Mitzura was spending some of her time in Geneva, where Arghezi Sr was undergoing treatment for what he termed ""sclerosis"" and ""loss of vision"". She also began contributing to Scrieri, the definitive corpus of Arghezi Sr's works. Its seventh volume, appearing in 1965, featured the Book of Toys, again illustrated with her drawings. Mitzura and Baruțu (who was by then a physical education teacher in Bucharest) looked after the aging writer from 1966, when he became a distraught widower. Shortly after his death in 1967, Mitzura was made custodian of his papers, including his unpublished literary works. In 1970, she created controversy by refusing to authorize a critical edition, which had been proposed to her by researcher G. Pienescu. In a 2004 article, Pienescu further accused ""Domnica Theodorescu, the writer's biological successor"", of having borrowed his documentary collection under false pretense, of never returning it, and of then fraudulently using it for her own Arghezi editions.
Though he had reconnected with his family, visiting Romania in 1958 and 1959, Eli Lotar was left out of the disputes and publication projects—he died in his self-imposed exile in 1969. Instead, Mitzura's activities involved her younger brother: in December 1972, the two of them appeared in public in Craiova, at a festivity marking both the relaunch of Scrisul Românesc publishing house and the publication of their father's last poems. The following year, they issued with Editura Eminescu their own anthology of his poetic manuscripts, as Călătorie în vis (""Dream-journey""). It was poorly reviewed by M. Camil in Milcovul newspaper, primarily because ""none of the book's poems is an Arghezian masterpiece."" In 1974, Baruțu opted to settle in Switzerland, and took with him all of his father's explicitly anticommunist manuscripts, that he intended to publish abroad. On his departure, he left his sister the remaining rights of usage for all other parts of the estate. By 1975, Mărțișor had become a museum, and Mitzura had been appointed its curator—calling this ""my most important achievement"". Serving continuously to her death in 2015, she organized it as a venue used by the Museum of Romanian Literature.Arghezi's contribution as in the literary field went in parallel with her film and theater career. In 1966, she appeared as a provincial wife in the interwar-themed satire Calea Victoriei, and, as critic D. I. Suchianu argued, proved ""excellent"" for the part; she also reunited with Saizescu, with a role in his new project, La porțile pamîntului. Still employed by the National Theater, that same year she was noted for her performance as a nomadic Romani in Andrei Corteanu's Copiii pămîntului. In 1967, she appeared in Moni Ghelerter's production of Siringa—written by her father during his Antonescu-era internment, it had its inspiration in the author's real-life illnesses and his disdain for the medical profession. The year 1970 brought a celebrated performance as a servant girl in Horia Lovinescu's Al patrulea anotimp, as produced by the National Theater. The following year, she debuted in amateur rallying: in June, she and Adrian Mureșan, driving a Dacia 1300, took bronze in an actors' competition held at Dinamo Stadium. In 1973, she appeared in Sergiu Nicolaescu's Ultimul cartuș, followed in 1978 by Eu, tu, și... Ovidiu, and in 1980 by Drumul oaselor. Between these, in March 1974 she was cast in the Romanian Television special Când trăiești mai adevărat (""When You Live out Your Best""), directed by Ion Cojar from a teleplay by Paul Everac.Arghezi also found steady employment as a voice actress: the Radio Broadcasting Company had her appear in numerous radio plays, including at least two by her father, and also made her a co-host of the show De toate pentru toți. Alongside Ludovic Antal, she voiced a version of the Book of Toys, which, beginning in 1984, was sold as a collectible LP by Electrecord. Also in 1984, she starred in the comedy The Secret of Bacchus, followed in 1987 by The Secret of Nemesis. She was allowed to travel in the West, and visited the United States at some point in the 1980s. As she reported in 2002: ""I did not like it, I wouldn't have defected there, not for a million dollars"".


=== Political debut ===
Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Arghezi's activities at Mărțișor could explore topics that had been forbidden under the communist regime—in mid-1990, she and the Romania–Israel Friendship Society co-hosted a soiree dedicated to her father's philosemitism. She also provided the Centre Pompidou with images of her half-brother, which were used at the Eli Lotar retrospective of 1993–1994. In 1992, she sealed an agreement with the Romanian state, whereby the latter would acquire her rights to Mărțișor upon her death. Her own home on Cerchez Street, which she now shared with the National Institute for the Study of Totalitarianism (INST), fell under scrutiny, because any records of previous ownership had apparently been misplaced.By her own account, Arghezi joined Corneliu Vadim Tudor's Greater Romania Party (PRM) in 1992, this being her first political affiliation. This contradicts an assessment provided in 1995 by journalist Ion Cristoiu, according to whom Arghezi had ""seamlessly moved on"" from an early engagement with another nationalist group, called Romanian National Unity Party. A decade later, she described her involvement with the PRM as being motivated by her belief that ""too many concessions are being made to the Hungarians"", and by her perception of Vadim Tudor as a ""patriot [and] one of the few honest politicians."" In one of her speeches in 1997, she described the party doctrine as ""national, but not extremist"". According to a press report in Gazeta de Sud, during that interval Arghezi was suspected of leaking classified information preserved by her INST neighbors to the PRM's magazines, România Mare and Politica.The PRM joined the Văcăroiu Cabinet coalition (the ""Red Quadrilateral""), awarding Arghezi a position as Executive Secretary of the governmental department for Romanian diaspora affairs in early 1995. The department had been created as a special request by Vadim Tudor, and had Arghezi as its inaugural leader. In September, Cristoiu panned her activity as a sample of graft, describing Arghezi as a ""failed actress"" and one of her father's ""worst creations"". Arghezi only served in the department to November 1995, when she voluntarily resigned as a result of reshuffles. In July, she had been shortlisted by Vadim Tudor for an adjunct position in the Ministry of Culture, but rejected by Minister Viorel Mărginean—allegedly, because the latter found her too old and unattractive. The following month, she went public with criticism of the government, noting that it was too lenient toward the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR). In that context, she demanded that the UDMR be outlawed for instigating a ""civil war"" in Transylvanian constituencies.Arghezi was Vadim Tudor's campaign manager ahead of a general election in November 1996. She herself ran in for the Chamber of Deputies, winning a seat in Olt County. The PRM list enjoyed unexpected success in that province, taking 7% of the vote. This win made her one of the 21 (out of 341) deputies who were of the female gender, including PRM deputies Daniela Buruiană and Leonida Lari. The PRM as a whole was in opposition to the governing Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR). By mid-1998, Arghezi had involved herself in the national polemics. On one of her frequent tours of her constituency, she responded to Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, an activist and former political prisoner who had publicized documents depicting Vadim Tudor as a longtime informant of the communist Securitate. According to Arghezi, the dossier was fabricated from falsified evidence by forces operating from ""outside the country's borders"". In her counterclaim, she alleged that Dumitrescu had been involved in communist reeducation, and was therefore not a victim.During the miners' protests of January 1999, Arghezi visited Slatina, and spoke out against the Vasile Cabinet for not allowing protesters to exit the Jiu Valley and complete their march on Bucharest. She came to serve on the Chamber's Committee on Human Rights, where, as she put it, she clashed with the UDMR, whose representatives she regarded as single-minded: ""they are unified and they keep on advancing [their agenda]."" In this capacity, she also helped strike down Mariana Stoica's project for the legalization of brothels. During the final deliberation of 6 October 1999, she argued that medical tests as outlined in that bill were not sufficient guarantees against the AIDS epidemic. The former actress was reelected in the elections of December 2000. She and Vadim Tudor were on show together to celebrate the PRM's unexpectedly good result, as the second-ranking party nationally. Arghezi went on to preside upon the new Chamber's inaugural meeting, as the most senior member of the house; this also made her the first woman to ever preside over a meeting of Chamber.


=== Old age and death ===
Arghezi's other work was with the committee on the Francophonie, which allowed her to ""travel quite a lot"", including in French-speaking Africa, and to observe that ""black people are rather smart"". She was also supportive of Romania's projected accession into the European Union. Around the same time, she became embroiled in controversies regarding her party's ideology and stances on government corruption. During April 2000, CDR Prime Minister Radu Vasile supervised an audit of the diaspora department, which produced allegations that Arghezi had engaged in embezzlement of public funds—including by not being able to account for electronic devices sent to the Romanians in Ukraine. In early 2001, Arghezi attended a festivity in Rahova, where a local high school was being named after Romanian Jewish novelist Mihail Sebastian. Arghezi's presence was described as inappropriate by Minimum, the Romanian-language Israeli magazine, who saw it as part of a PRM publicity stunt: ""as if the party led by C. V. Tudor is head over heels in love with us Jews.""At the PRM national congress, held at the Palace of the Parliament in November 2001, Arghezi read out a congratulatory message from the Chinese Communist Party; this event, which saw party delegates issuing renewed calls for the UDMR's outlawing, was not attended by guests from Romania's other parliamentary groups. During July 2001, she had been scheduled to appear as Vadim Tudor's witness in a civil suit for libel, brought up by the CDR's Gavril Dejeu. She was fined in September for failing to appear in court. On the first days of 2003, Arghezi and Vadim Tudor signed up to a class action against Prime Minister Adrian Năstase, accused of having breached the Romanian constitution by allowing Cluj-Napoca to carry a second official name, in Hungarian. In mid-2002, Arghezi, alongside her former colleague Sergiu Nicolaescu (who had similarly become a national legislator), proposed controversial legislation that would have resulted in deputies receiving a significantly increased state pension, as compared to the average Romanian. The bill was vetoed by, among others, Vadim Tudor, who argued that Arghezi had ""signed on to it without knowing what it was all about"". Those months introduced speculation that Arghezi was growing senile, especially after, during a PRM rally at Sibiu, she dozed off in her chair, slipping and breaking her arm as a result.Arghezi still continued to serve for another full mandate in Chamber, down to full-term elections in November 2004. She ran on the PRM Chamber list in Buzău County, but was no longer successful. She carried on as a PRM representative on the Radio Broadcasting Company board (2005–2010). This period saw Arghezi reaffirming her loyalty to Vadim Tudor: during the party schism organized in mid-2005 by Corneliu Ciontu, she remained affiliated with the Vadim wing, and served as head of its female section. In November 2005, she was confirmed as a member of the PRM's Permanent Bureau. Political scientist Tom Gallagher made a note of her dedication to the cause, as part of a larger phenomenon: ""Proportionately more women sit on the parliamentary benches of the PRM than for any other party [...]. No woman has been among the numerous senior defectors from the PRM, so Vadim may have grounds for feeling that his position is secure if they are given a prominent role in party affairs.""Before the end of her Chamber mandate, Arghezi filled out a mandatory wealth declaration. It reportedly showed her as one of the least affluent MPs, who owned to her name some three hectares of agricultural land, a Dacia Nova, and an apartment.  In 2002, she complained that all the expenses at Mărțișor were covered by her, and that the Museum of Literature was not fulfilling its tasks. She noted having never had children of her own, but also that she was looking after a relative, born with a major speech impediment. She was also involved in animal-welfare causes. Arghezi was also noted, and criticized, for her strict application of copyright law when it came to her father's poetic works: in 2005, she reportedly sued a publishing house for releasing an unauthorized version of her father's children's rhyme, Zdreanță. Four years later, her habit of charging exorbitant sums for the right to reuse any of her father's poems threatened private publishing houses, who could no longer afford to include them in literary textbooks, and considered skipping them entirely. Similarly, actor Ion Caramitru, who was performing poetry recitals to music by Johnny Răducanu, was forced to omit Arghezi's verse, but improvised with allusive references to it during a show held in Budapest.During the final stages of her life, Mitzura Arghezi joined Traian Radu in putting out the Tudor Arghezi corpus, which was being continued by Editura Minerva. These included the 42nd volume, appearing in 1999, with unedited and uncensored articles from the 1940s. It was praised for its documentary value by literary historian Zigu Ornea, who also criticized the editors for not including relevant information, and for tolerating ""many typos."" Arghezi survived her younger brother, who had returned to Romania—where he managed to publish his own edition of his father's secret works, in 2010. He died in Arad on 26 August of that year. Mitzura ceased her activities in September 2015, when she checked herself into Elias Hospital. She was later relocated to a nursing home in Bucharest's Sector 1.This episode divided Arghezi's extended family and circle of friends, with Baruțu's daughter Doina Elena reporting her as missing; she was found to be sharing the lodging with Traian Radu, whom she had designated as her sole heir. Vadim Tudor spoke out against Radu on Antena 1, criticizing his decisions on Mitzura's behalf. This was reportedly his own last television interview, followed shortly by his death on 14 September. Mitzura herself died on the morning of 27 October; she was aged 90. An Orthodox funeral service was held for her at Mărțișor, where she was buried, in a tomb shared with her parents. This had been her request, included in the donation she had negotiated with the Romanian state. The ceremony was interrupted by another dispute around her remaining wealth, manifested as a heated exchange between Traian Radu and Doina Arghezi.

4,"Clotilde Marie Brigitte Armand (born 28 June 1973) is a French-born Romanian politician and businesswoman. Since October 2020, she is Mayor of Bucharest's Sector 1.
Armand first ran for Mayor of Sector 1 in the 2016 Romanian local elections on behalf of Save Bucharest Union (USB), a local party she had co-founded in 2015, eventually losing narrowly after having been announced as winner by the exit polls. From July 2019 until November 2020 she was a Member of the European Parliament.


== Early life and education ==
Clotilde Marie Brigitte Armand was born in Pointe-à-Pitre, France, where her father was undergoing alternative military service as a mathematics teacher. Her family was from Vichy, where she also attended primary and secondary school. She studied at the École Centrale Paris and then the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she met her future husband, Sergiu Moroianu, a Romanian mathematician. She married Moroianu in 1997 and moved to Bucharest in 1999. In the following years, she lived some years in France and Germany, before settling in Bucharest again in 2003.


== Career ==
In 2002, Armand worked for Airbus in France and Germany, managing part of the A380 project management team. In 2005, she became IT Director of Distrigaz Sud, the Romanian branch of gas distribution giant GDF Suez, later moving to Paris as Innovation Director for GDF Suez Europe. Between September 2013 and March 2017, Armand was the head of the Romanian and Bulgarian branches of French engineering company Egis.She acquired Romanian citizenship in 2015.


== Political career ==


=== 2016 local elections ===
Nicușor Dan, a political activist and friend of Armand's husband, founded a new party called Save Bucharest Union. Armand was chosen by the party to be their mayoral candidate for Bucharest's Sector 1 and began organizing her campaign only six weeks before the deadline. Her campaign was based on anti-corruption and against politics as usual, arguing that ""the political class has been separated from the true will of the people"".She promised better management of public services, following the urban design model of Paris (replacing the car-centered model with a public transport model) and building an esplanade surrounding the lakes in the northern part of the sector.Although exit polls and early results indicated she was the winner, the final results showed that she lost to Social Democratic Party's Dan Tudorache, who received 23,220 votes (31,07%), while Armand received only 21,504 votes (28,77%).Nicușor Dan, the president of SBU noted some statistical discrepancies: in the precincts where the party had observers, Armand won by a slim margin, whereas in the precincts where it did not have observers, Armand lost. Also, the number of canceled votes was substantially higher in those precincts and there were discrepancies between the number of ballots given to each precinct and returned. A member of the Electoral Bureau told the press that the reason of the discrepancies was that electoral precinct presidents were ""idiots"" who filled in wrongly the forms.While not accusing anyone of vote fraud, Armand asked for a recount in 18 precincts. The Sector 1 Electoral Constituency Bureau refused the recount, arguing that the ""lack of diligence"" of her party (for not being represented in all precincts) was not the fault of the Electoral Bureau. Around 500 supporters of Armand organized a protest in University Square, demanding a recount.Armand had also sent an objection of unconstitutionality, arguing that the plurality voting system is flawed because in her the mayor was elected by only 10% of the constituents. The objection has been accepted and forwarded to the Constitutional Court.She was on both the Save Bucharest Union's lists for the Bucharest and Sector 1 councilors and, after the elections, she chose to be a Sector 1 councilor.


=== Member of the European Parliament, 2019–2020 ===
In the 2019 European elections, Armand was fourth on the USR-PLUS list (first woman) and she won an MP seat. Armand is one of only two women among the eight MP elected on the USR-PLUS list. She served on the Committee on Budgets.
In addition to her committee assignments, Armand was part of the MEPs Against Cancer group.


== Controversy ==
Immediately after entering politics in 2016, Armand was accused that, in her capacity of director of Egis Romania, she personally profited from a motorway building contract gone awry between the Romanian state company CNAIR and Bechtel Corporation. Armand denies vigorously any involvement in the Bechtel affair. She responded that she started working for Egis only in September 2013, months after CNAIR's contract with Bechtel ended (in March 2013); that Egis verified the quality of the works of Bechtel, was not bound by contractual links to Bechtel, and defended the interests of its client CNAIR; that moreover she was not a stakeholder in Egis. In spite of her explanations, Armand is frequently depicted in some media venues as having ""cashed 50 million dollars from Bechtel"".


== Political positions ==
Armand argues that Romania needs a change of the political class. She wrote an open letter to President Klaus Iohannis in which she asked the two main parties of Romania (the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party, both of which have roots in the National Salvation Front) to apologize for their involvement in the June 1990 Mineriad and to remove former president Ion Iliescu and former Prime Minister Petre Roman from public life.Armand says she does not believe in the left–right politics paradigm, arguing that, in Romania, the money wasted due to corruption is far higher than the differences between standard left and right policies. Nevertheless, she considers herself, within the French political context, a person that is naturally right-wing, but that Romania currently has many people who need the help of the state and that these people, who did not adapt to the changes and are no longer useful to society, should be re-integrated.

6,"Elena Băsescu, sometimes referred to as EBA, (born 24 April 1980 in Constanța) is a Romanian politician, the former secretary general of the youth wing of Romania's Democratic Liberal Party, and a Member of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2014. She is the youngest daughter of Traian Băsescu, the former President of Romania. She was formerly a model, and entered politics in 2007. She has a degree in economics.


== Political career ==
Before standing for elections on her own, she was an intern of the MEP Monica Iacob Ridzi. Elena Băsescu stood as a candidate for the European Parliament in the 2009 election. She had sought to stand as a candidate for her father's Democratic Liberal Party, but was rejected by the party, in particular by intellectuals like Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, so she ran as an independent. Nonetheless, she ""wasted no time in gathering 200,000 signatures for her candidacy"". L'Express noted that her candidacy still caused some concern in the party, due to fears that she might draw votes away from it. Her initial popularity in opinion polls was high (16%), but subsequently dropped to 5 or 6% shortly before the election.
However 75% of the electorate did not vote in sign of protest, this being the lowest turnout in Romanian history for an election, and the percentage that voted for her was from a minority composed of the members of the party that was once ruled by her father Traian Băsescu, the President of Romania at the time. During the campaign she caused some controversy after declaring herself in favor of legalizing marijuana use. Prior to her election journalists discovered that some members of the Democratic Liberal Party were instructed to vote for her in order to secure her election. She immediately rejoined the Democratic Liberal Party after she was elected to the European Parliament, and subsequently is also a member of the European People's Party. Due to Elena's support for marijuana legalization and allegations of nepotism, Hungarian MEP László Surján questioned her entry into the EPP group in an email sent to all EPP members.


== Personal and political image ==
Oana Lungescu, a Romanian BBC reporter, described her in 2009 as a ""sexy celebrity"" and the ""Paris Hilton of Romania"" because she is ""known to be more interested in parties than party politics"", and notes that ""video clips of her verbal gaffes are internet hits."" Similarly, L'Express described her as having had to ""face accusations of nepotism and incompetence, fuelled by her series of gaffes and grammatical blunders"". Alison Mutler, an Associated Press writer, published a story in which an unnamed critic describes Băsescu as ""an inflatable Barbie doll"". Elena Băsescu considered herself and her father defamed by the article, described Mutler as ""politically partisan"", and stated that Romania's public image has been damaged as a result of Mutler's writing. She also took offense at Mutler's own description that she ""prances down the catwalk, goes clubbing until the wee hours and mangles her grammar"", pointing out her degree in banking and finance, the fact that she had quit modeling two years before running for an EP seat, and described her own presence in clubs as characterized by ""decent behavior, without affecting in any way those around her.""Elena Băsescu's association with Monica Iacob Ridzi, who has been accused of embezzlement before she resigned as Youth Minister in 2009, was exploited by Romanian media critical of Traian Băsescu, such as Realitatea TV. Traian Băsescu accused media hostile to him, in particular that owned by Sorin Ovidiu Vântu, of trying to promote guilt by association, by repeatedly broadcasting these images.

== Personal life ==
Diana Iovanovici Șoșoacă was born on 13 November 1975 in Bucharest, Romania. Her paternal grandparents were from Skopje, modern North Macedonia; Iovanovici Șoșoacă has stated that ""half of me is from Skopje"". Her paternal grandparents and their whole family migrated to Romania, with her grandfather having fought during World War II at the Battle of Stalingrad. According to Iovanovici Șoșoacă, an aunt of hers was imprisoned for fighting against the communist regime of Romania. Iovanovici Șoșoacă's mother is Alice Florescu Bleotu, a gynecologist and specialist in esotericism. Iovanovici Șoșoacă is married to Dumitru Silvestru Șoșoacă, who is her third husband.


== Political life ==
Iovanovici Șoșoacă gained notorious popularity in 2020 after she published several messages against COVID-19 restriction measures on social media sites such as Facebook. Iovanovici Șoșoacă is a former member of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and part of the Senate of Romania for the Iași County since 21 December 2020. She later said that she did not want to enter the Parliament of Romania but that she was forced by other people who pressured her. On 10 February 2021, she was excluded from AUR's parliamentary group after AUR members Claudiu Târziu and Sorin Lavric proposed her exclusion for not following the party's strategy. Subsequently, on 30 May 2022, she joined S.O.S. Romania, a party founded in November 2021. Iovanovici Șoșoacă is one of the main anti-vaccine figures of the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania. She also supports a Romanian withdrawal from the European Union and holds an anti-immigration rhetoric centered on the Syrian-born Romanian physician Raed Arafat.On 12 December 2021, Iovanovici Șoșoacă was accused by the Italian television channel Rai 1 of having kidnapped the journalist Lucia Goracci following an interview about COVID-19 pandemic. The journalist decided to leave the apartment where the interview was planned to be held after the senator told her that if the person who translate does not translate correctly she will pause them and correct them. Furthermore, one of the teammates tried to enter and a room without consent where the senator had important documents. Therefore the senator did not want them to leave before the police come and question their suspicious acts but the door was never locked as Gorraci left the apartment before police came in. The journalist was later arrested under accusations of possible theft and trespassing made by the senator towards her, and she was released only following the intervention of the Italian embassy in Romania.Iovanovici Șoșoacă has also been recurrently criticized in Romanian media for her ties with Russia. The Russian state-controlled Sputnik news agency labeled her ""the politician of the year 2021 in Romania"". Furthermore, in March 2022, in the midst of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Iovanovici Șoșoacă together with 3 other parliamentarians met with the Russian ambassador in Bucharest ""on the theme of the memorandum related to the Peace of Bucharest"", discussing a ""position of neutrality of Romania"" in the invasion, without the approval for representation by the Parliament leadership. One of those parliamentarians was PSD deputy Dumitru Coarnă, who was expelled from the party shortly after the meeting.Additionally, Iovanovici Șoșoacă was appreciated by Killnet (a pro-Russia hacking group which launched in 2022 a series of cyberattacks on multiple Romanian websites), after she said that Romania must not get involved in the war in Ukraine. In March 2023, she proposed a law project on the Romanian Parliament for the annexation by Romania of Northern Bukovina, the Hertsa region, Budjak, Northern Maramureș and Snake Island from Ukraine, as they were ""historical territories"" that belong to Romania as stated in the law project. In retaliation, Ukraine announced it would impose sanctions against Iovanovici Șoșoacă, labeling her as a threat to Ukrainian national security. In February 2023, she accused the United States of having caused the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes using a seismic weapon. Moreover, on 21 November, Diana Șoșoacă interrupted a secret session in the Parliament of Romania, during which the massacres committed by Hamas during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war were presented, screaming ""Palestine"". She took a soft pro-Palestine stance during the conflict, claiming that Romania should be neutral and mediate the conflict, that Hamas does not represent all Palestinians and that Israel is also commiting war crimes.

== Controversy ==
During her legislative terms as an MEP, Manescu has defended the Azerbaijani regime against the criticism of the European Parliament. In 2015, following the adoption of a resolution criticizing the crack-down on the human rights and oppression of the freedom of expression in the country by the European Parliament, Mănescu made a statement supporting Azerbaijan. She referred to the ″democratic values″ of the country.
Mănescu's pro-Azerbaijani attitude was criticized by human rights organizations, including the Civic Solidarity Platform. The NGO included Mănescu in its investigative report on the European politicians who advocate for Azerbaijan. According to the report with a title “European Values Bought and Sold, An exploration into Azerbaijan’s sophisticated system of projecting its international influence, buying Western politicians and capturing intergovernmental organisations”, in 2016 Mănescu joined the European People's Party delegation for an observation mission of the controversial constitutional referendum in Azerbaijan. The final report and the composition of the delegation was not published by the European People's Party.
According to above mentioned report ""the composition of the delegation can only be deduced from the media quotes and pictures from the media and official presidential website. In these pictures, for example, besides those specifically mentioned in the media, an MEP Ramona Manescu could be seen during the meeting with Aliyev and the press-conference. A week earlier she was on an EU-Azerbaijan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee visit to Baku, where she could be seen posing next to Aliyev. One wonders whether between these two events Ms. Manescu enjoyed Azerbaijani hospitality in Baku for several days”.


== Prizes and distinctions ==
In 2008, Mănescu was designated MEP of the Year for Culture and Education, a distinction awarded by The Parliament Magazine.

In the Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu cabinet, she served as Minister of Culture and Religious Affairs from 2004 to 2005.


== Biography ==
She was born in Turda and attended the Philology Faculty of the West University of Timișoara. Following graduation, she became assistant professor at her alma mater, teaching the Romanian language to foreign students. She was also a scientific researcher at the Romanian Academy's Iorgu Iordan Institute of Linguistics, with articles and speciality studies to her name.Following the 1989 Revolution, Muscă joined the Civic Alliance Foundation and then the Civic Alliance Party, joining the PNL in 1995. She arrived in Parliament in 1996, on the lists of the Romanian Democratic Convention, surviving that alliance's 2000 defeat due to her closeness to Valeriu Stoica. In the Chamber, she sat on the committees for culture, art and mass media (1996-2007); equal opportunity between men and women (2000-2004; 2006-2007); and foreign policy (2007); and was vice president of the body from December 2004 to January 2005. During her legislative career, Muscă initiated bills on a number of subjects: setting up ROMPRES, legal holidays, prevention of cruelty to animals, protection for victims of domestic violence, national security, conflict of interest in public functions and free access to public information. It was this last proposal, made in 2001, that gave her public visibility, allowing her to cast herself as a link between politicians and civil society. She also helped initiate a lustration law, inspired by the Proclamation of Timișoara and meant to exclude from public office those ""who were part of the power structures and repressive apparatus of the Communist regime"". In 2004, she was the only politician to file a penal complaint against Prime Minister Adrian Năstase in the ""Zambaccian"" corruption case. Following the election that year, Năstase defeated her in her bid to become President of the Chamber of Deputies. Muscă instead was named Culture and Religious Affairs Minister by the new PNL Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. She resigned in August 2005, citing incompatibility with Tăriceanu, whom she had criticised for not calling early elections. Within her party, she was a vice president of the PNL.In August 2006, Evenimentul Zilei newspaper published documents indicating that Muscă had collaborated with the Securitate secret police during the 1970s. In response, she made public a collaboration agreement signed in March 1977, in which she accepted the code name ""Dana"" and agreed to provide information about foreign students. She expressed her regret at having signed, but said she did not realise this would involve her in collaboration with the secret police. A dossier attests that she gave 15 notes containing information to the secret police, although only two such written documents were discovered. The following month, the PNL removed her from the party and the CNSAS, an institution charged with investigating Securitate affiliations, declared her a collaborator. Later that year, she challenged the ruling, which the CNSAS then affirmed. She also joined the new PLD about that time. In March 2007, the Bucharest Court of Appeal confirmed the CNSAS verdict, prompting her resignation from Parliament and from the PLD. Although she faced prison or a fine for having issued an official declaration stating she had not collaborated with the Securitate, in 2010 prosecutors decided not to press charges against her.Muscă divorced her first husband around the time of her Securitate collaboration. In 1982, she married Gavril Muscă, head of the Bucharest Chemical Energy Institute and a friend of the Ceaușescu family that then led Romania. She has one daughter.

She is married and has one child.


== Biography ==


=== Early career ===
She was born in Sinaia, and, following secondary studies at the town's George Enescu High School, in 1983 she graduated from the Law Faculty of the University of Bucharest. From 1983 to 1991, she was a prosecutor at the Olteniţa courthouse, and from 1991 to 1993 was legal adviser to a rural trucking company in Călăraşi. She worked as a lawyer in the same city from 1991 to 1997. From 1998 to 2001, Nicolai was president of the Economic and Social Council, a public institution that facilitates dialogue between employers, unions and the government; and was a secretary of state at the Labour Ministry from 1997 to 2000. She belonged to the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNŢ-CD) from 1997 until August 2000, when it expelled her for signing a declaration in support of then-PNL member Theodor Stolojan; the PNŢ-CD supported Mugur Isărescu in the upcoming presidential election.In autumn 2000, by then a PNL member, she was elected to the Senate, being re-elected in 2004. In 2006, she was the subject of controversy when cameras caught her niece in her Senate chair with a voting card in her hand, although Nicolai stated her niece did not actually cast a vote. The following year, she became a vice president both of her party and of the Senate; she was the first woman to preside over a session of that chamber. While in the Senate, she served on the defence, anti-corruption, equal opportunity, and judiciary committees, including as president of the last from March 2008. During Tăriceanu's time in office from 2004, her name was floated for the Justice, Interior and Defence portfolios, but she was only offered the Labour Ministry when his second cabinet was formed, a nomination she declined.


=== Nomination as Justice Minister ===
In December 2007, following the resignation of Tudor Chiuariu, she was nominated as Justice Minister by Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu; the latter was initially said to have had misgivings about her connections with the secret services and her Communist-era judgeship, but went ahead after public pressure from party colleagues and a near-unanimous vote of approval from the PNL political bureau. Upon being nominated, she vowed to increase the independence of the judiciary and improve its image, to push a new penal code through Parliament (the last one dating to 1969), and to fight corruption. The following month, a series of events ultimately derailed her nomination. President Traian Băsescu began by asking Tăriceanu to withdraw Nicolai, claiming the negative image she had acquired as senator, in particular through the affair involving her niece, would not be conducive to increased public trust in the judiciary. The prime minister responded that, as no legal argument for barring her from the position had been raised, the president had no power to veto the appointment.Băsescu then declared he would never name Nicolai as Justice Minister, and his office released documents relating to two procedural errors it said she had committed while a prosecutor in Olteniţa. (This came after Tăriceanu refused several telephone calls from Băsescu, and the entire affair formed part of a larger power struggle between the two.) The first referred to a 1987 case where she drew up an indictment and an innocent person was held under arrest for eighteen days as a result—this individual had the same name as the one being sought by the authorities (wanted for wheat theft), but upon realising this, Clinci altered his arrest warrant to match the other man's information rather than reveal the mistake. In a 1991 case (following the 1989 fall of the Communist regime), she represented a foreign citizen in an adoption case, despite her status as prosecutor, and then claimed not to know that the law forbade this; she left her position a month later. Nicolai in turn produced a document indicating the individual in the 1987 case did not spend any time in prison (and calling Băsescu's version of events an ""insolent lie""), and said she appeared in the adoption case as a private individual, not a prosecutor, and did not violate the law. Nicolai further opined that the document release was reminiscent of the methods of the Securitate secret police; the PNL's UDMR government partners also weighed in on the prime minister's side, as did the opposition PSD. Others too viewed the document release as ""questionable"", with several lawyers stressing the confidential nature of the files.Later, Băsescu asked Tăriceanu to name an interim minister until a permanent officeholder could be found; Defence Minister Teodor Meleşcanu assumed that role. Băsescu and Tăriceanu then held an inconclusive meeting about the Justice portfolio; afterwards, the latter took the case to the Constitutional Court, reiterating his claim that Băsescu lacked the authority to stop the appointment. In early February 2008, the court ruled that Băsescu could legally reject the prime minister's nominee for a vacant ministerial position once, and that Tăriceanu was obliged to choose someone else for the position. By the end of the month, the two had agreed on a new minister, and Cătălin Predoiu took office.


=== Subsequent career ===
At the 2008 election, Nicolai was defeated in her bid for a third Senate term: she finished first in her constituency but failed to obtain a seat under the mixed member proportional representation system introduced at that election. She was re-elected as a PNL vice president at a party congress in March 2009, and at the same time supported Crin Antonescu's successful bid to become party president. In what some saw as a quid pro quo, she was placed first on the party's lists at the June 2009 European Parliament election, where she won a seat. During the subsequent five-year term, she sat on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she was vice president of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. At the May 2014 European Parliament election, again running first on the PNL list, she won another term as an MEP. When her party subsequently left the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE) for the European People's Party (EPP), Nicolai opted to remain with the former caucus, which assigned her to the Fisheries Committee. In May 2015, the PNL decided to remove Nicolai as a party member due to her decision to remain with ALDE.

In 2010, protesting what she saw as the ""fraudulent"" adoption of a pensions law, she appeared in Parliament in a prison uniform borrowed from the Jilava penitentiary. Prior to addressing legislators, President Traian Băsescu asked her, ""Do you really think you needed to create a circus, madam?"" In March 2012, after two years heading the Călărași County chapter of the PSD, she was removed from that position after clashing with the party leadership, objecting to its decision to dismiss Marian Vanghelie as head of the Bucharest party organization. Days later, she resigned from the party, alleging that it was no longer promoting advantages for ordinary people, instead advancing the personal interests of certain of its leaders. For the 2012 election, she ran on the lists of the Social Liberal Union, backed by the PSD, and won a new term. Initially assigned to the culture committee, she was later placed on the foreign policy committee. In October 2014, she received a three-year suspended sentence in a conflict of interest case that arose after she hired her mother in her parliamentary office. The following March, when a corruption investigation against Vanghelie began, she resigned from the Chamber, citing a wish not to impede the judicial process. In October 2016, her three-year suspended sentence was reduced to one year.In 1999, she married Lebanese businessman Jamil Tohme. In 2012, she and Vanghelie, the mayor of Sector 5, which included her electoral district, confirmed that for the past year, they were in a relationship that had begun after each separated from their respective spouse. The couple had a daughter in 2015. Oana Mizil is nicknamed Laleaua neagră (""The Black Tulip"") after a legendary woman who benefited the Roma residents of Ferentari.

36,"Hildegard Carola Puwak (16 September 1949–25 May 2018) was a Romanian politician, a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who served as the Minister for European Integration from 2000 until October 2003 (as part of the Adrian Năstase cabinet). Puwak was of German ethnicity (Swabian) and represented Timiș County in the Chamber of Deputies from 1996 to 2004.


== Education and career ==
Puwak was born on 16 September 1949, in Reșița. She graduated in 1971 from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies (ASE), Faculty of Commerce, magna cum laudae, and in 1979 got a doctorate in economics from the same university. Between 1971 and 1992 she was a Visiting Professor at ASE, and also a research fellow at the National Institute of Economy and Life Standard Research in Bucharest. In 1992 she worked as a Visiting Professor at ""a series of universities in the United States (Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Chicago) and Germany (Darmstadt)"".

In 1996 she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and acted as Deputy chairman to the Commission for European Integration, and was also a member of the Commission for Economical Policy, Reform and Privatization.


== Corruption scandal ==
On 29 July 2003 a corruption scandal broke out when Adevărul newspaper accused Puwak of facilitating access for her husband's and her son's companies to some 150,000 non-reimbursable Euros through the ""Leonardo da Vinci"" European Union program, while she was in charge of those funds. Puwak denied the accusations, stating the applications had been submitted while she was an opposition MP. The opposition parties of that time, PD and PNL, demanded her resignation or dismissal. On 2 September, Puwak demanded that the anti-corruption prosecutors (PNA) investigate the charges, and on the same day Prime Minister Adrian Năstase declared that the cabinet had full confidence in Puwak. On 4 September, a team from the European Commission's Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) arrived to investigate. OLAF spokesman Alessandro Buttice announced on 11 September that his office was opening a case meant to assist the Romanian authorities in investigating allegations against Puwak. On 13 October, PSD's Permanent Delegation (party leadership) decided to continue political support for her and Health Minister Mircea Beuran, awaiting the conclusion of the EU audit. Nevertheless, on 20 October, she resigned together with Beuran and Șerban Mihăilescu, the Secretary General of the Năstase government. The same day Năstase presented his proposal for replacements to president Ion Iliescu, leading to media speculation that the three were fired instead. Năstase commented that ""They resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters,"" referring to Romania's bid to join the EU.On 30 October, the Greater Romania Party, supported by PD and PNL, tried to initiate a parliamentary inquiry commission on the scandal, but this effort was defeated by the majority of the Romanian Senate. On 19 December 2003 the anti-corruption investigation was closed by prosecutor Adrian Miclescu without filing any charges. The case was then reopened on 26 August 2005, after the new Justice Minister Monica Macovei fired him. Eventually the case went to trial, and Puwak's husband, Iosif Mihai Puwak, was sentenced in December 2007 to a 30-month suspended sentence for embezzling 39,000 euros from the EU da Vinci funds. He was also ordered to reimburse the money. He appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Bucharest Court of Appeals on 4 June 2009. On 9 November 2009 her son Mihai Puwak was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling 32,160 euros from the same EU da Vinci funds, and ordered to reimburse the money. This sentence was final.

While a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), she was a member of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies for Bucharest in December 2004, and represented Prahova County in the Chamber from 2008 to 2012. In the interim, from 2004 to 2007, she was an adviser and press secretary for President Traian Băsescu.
She was married to former presidential adviser and former Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) director Claudiu Săftoiu for eighteen years until their divorce in 2011; they have one child.


== Biography ==
She was born in Dej and in 1992 graduated from the Romanian-Spanish department in the Literature Faculty of the University of Bucharest. She took a further year of studies in Comparative Literature at the same institution, as well as journalism classes at three different institutions between 1995 and 1998. From 1993 to 1996, she was a journalist for Rompres, then working at Mediafax from 1996 to 1998. From 1998 to 1999, holding the rank of secretary of state, she was press secretary for the government, while Radu Vasile served as Prime Minister. From 2000 to 2001, Săftoiu was cabinet director at the Transport Ministry, beginning when Băsescu held the ministerial portfolio. Between 2001 and 2004, she headed the press bureau of the Democratic Party (PD), after Băsescu became president of that party.In 2004, Săftoiu was elected to Parliament as a PD member, but resigned her seat five days later, after being appointed adviser within the Communications Department and press secretary to incoming President Băsescu; the two positions cannot be held simultaneously. One episode that marked her tenure was a conflict with Defence Minister Teodor Atanasiu, whom she took to court in July 2006 for abuse of office, accusing him of using the Army intelligence service to spy on her, following a comment he made on television to that effect. As a result, Atanasiu was suspended by the president before resigning under pressure several months later. Her resignation from the Băsescu administration in March 2007, coming shortly after that of her husband from the SIE directorship, prompted intense speculation. She stated it was for strictly personal reasons, but others cited an e-mail she sent to PD secretary general Vasile Blaga, in which she asked for his intervention with Băsescu to reconcile her family relations, which had allegedly deteriorated due to the intrigues of administration colleague Elena Udrea. Another theory pointed to a newspaper article alleging she was having an extramarital affair; rumours had also circulated that her husband was involved in an affair of his own. Săftoiu's departure came at a politically sensitive moment for the president, who was impeached shortly thereafter. The following month saw publication of Vocile puterii (""The Voices of Power""), her book of interviews with all sixteen post-1989 Revolution presidential and governmental press secretaries.From 2007 to 2008, Săftoiu headed Capital Promotion, a Bucharest consulting firm. In a February 2008 interview, she remarked that Băsescu, whom she accused of creating a Messiah image for himself, and Udrea, whom she described as ""dreaded but not respected"", rule the PDL (into which the PD had by then evolved) by fear. That summer, she joined the PNL, running for a seat in Prahova County, considered the fiefdom of one of Băsescu's most trenchant opponents, businessman Dinu Patriciu. She won her race at that autumn's election, after which the PNL moved into opposition. In the Chamber, she sat on the committee for education, science, youth and sport, and was a deputy leader of the PNL group from 2010. In February 2012, against a backdrop of anti-government protests and calls for early elections, Săftoiu resigned her seat. That December, Săftoiu's local PNL chapter removed her from the party without informing her in advance, prompting her to comment that the process was harsher than purges during Romanian Communist Party rule, when one could ""at least... say something in one's own defense"". In April 2013, Săftoiu became spokeswoman for the PD-L at the invitation of party leader Vasile Blaga, a move seen as a rebuke to Băsescu, who had earlier distanced himself from the party. In May 2015, she published a controversial memoir, Cronică de Cotroceni (""Cotroceni Chronicle""), recounting her years as Băsescu's adviser. Among the book's claims is that Băsescu and Udrea carried on an extramarital affair in the former's office at Cotroceni Palace; the two promptly denied the existence of such a liaison.

Soon afterwards, she expressed a desire to run in the 2009 European Parliament election on the lists of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), even considering joining the party until after the election. Her possible candidacy as a PIN member on the PSD lists angered a number of senior PSD members as well as the Conservative Party (PC), one of whose allocated spots on the PSD lists Șandru was slated to take. Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu even threatened to resign from the party, and Șandru lost hope of running once a PES directive required member parties' candidates to belong to the respective parties.

In the current socio-economic circumstances in Southern, Eastern and Central Europe, where the public health systems are under constant pressure from austerity measures, cancer patients and their families are the first to feel the impact on their health, finances and quality of life"".She was co-chair of the MEP Interest Group on Brain, Mind and Pain, an initiative of the European Federation of Neurological Associations [EFNA] and Pain Alliance Europe, whose aim was to explore issues of common interest to those affected by neurological and chronic pain disorders, including stigma, quality of life, research and patient involvement.


=== Rapporteur on the cloning of animals for farming purposes ===
She was Parliament's S&D group shadow rapporteur on the cloning of animals for farming purposes and repeatedly stated that EU rules on cloning animals for food must reflect citizens' concerns.


=== Supporting Romanian workers' rights in Europe ===
Politically, she was very active in supporting Romanian workers' rights in Europe, in the context of the rising extremist voices in the EU and especially around the deadline for lifting temporary restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers in the United Kingdom. She published an article in The Parliament Magazine, where she stated: ""The fueling of xenophobic fear, spiced up with apocalyptic terminology that conflates migration with conflict and disaster, isn't just factually inaccurate, it is irresponsible and dangerous. It fosters a deeply divisive, and, at times, hysterical debate which risks handing a victory to the extremist political parties which embody such rhetoric in their policies"".In 2015, following a derogatory statement by Nigel Farage against foreign-born doctors working in the UK, Sârbu wrote a letter addressed to several UK medical organisations, asking for their cooperation in defending the image of immigrant doctors and nurses working in the UK: ""As a Romanian citizen, I feel even more obliged to protest against such claims, since the insult is also directed at Romanian doctors and nurses who have left their families behind and work tirelessly every day in your country. I know that there is great appreciation in the UK for medical staff from my country, not only since they are the product of a highly regarded medical education system, but also for their consistently good work and integrity. Romanian doctors and nurses working abroad are honest, reliable and exceptionally well-trained"".

41,"Alexandra Sidorovici (6 July 1906 – 25 August 2000) was a Romanian politician. A prominent communist, she was one of the first group of women elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946.


== Biography ==
Sidorovici was born in 1906 in Constanța in a well-to-do family. Her brother,  Teofil, served as a cabinet minister in 1940 before committing suicide. One of her ancestors was British, and she spoke perfect English. She married Silviu Brucan, a communist politician and diplomat, with whom she had three children. Brucan later became a critic of Nicolae Ceaușescu.
During World War II, she reportedly was implicated in spying activities on behalf of the Soviet Union. In April 1945, Sidorovici was appointed by royal decree public prosecutor at the Bucharest People's Tribunal. In this position, which she held until 1946, she participated in trials of the Romanian political and cultural elite. In May and June 1945 she, Constantin Vicol, Ion D. Ioan and Avram Bunaciu prosecuted a dozen prominent journalists, including Pan M. Vizirescu, Pamfil Șeicaru, Stelian Popescu, Nichifor Crainic, Grigore Manoilescu and Radu Gyr.In the 1946 general elections she was among the first group of women elected to the Chamber of Deputies. In early 1948, she worked on the merger of the Communist Party (PCR) with the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), to form the Romanian Workers' Party (PMR). Later that year she was elected to the new Great National Assembly, and appointed Secretary General of the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, a role she held until 1958.

42,"Rodica Mihaela Stănoiu (born May 10, 1939) is a Romanian jurist and politician. A member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and later the Conservative Party (PC), she was a member of the Romanian Senate for Olt County from 1996 to 2008, with a hiatus in March–December 2004. In the Adrian Năstase cabinet, she was Minister of Justice from 2000 to 2004.


== Biography ==
Born in Nucet, Dâmbovița County, she attended the Law Faculty of the University of Bucharest from 1957 to 1961. She undertook Criminology studies at the Université de Montréal from 1968 to 1969, and obtained a Doctor of Law degree in Bucharest in 1974, with a thesis on International Criminal Law. She also studied Comparative Law at the University of Strasbourg in 1982. From 1961 to 2000, she worked as a scientific researcher at Bucharest's Institute for Judicial Studies (ICJ), advancing in rank in 1971 and again in 1990, when she became head of the Public Law Department. During her career as professor and researcher in criminal law and criminology, she authored or co-authored fourteen monographs, 130 studies and 30 reports to international congresses. She was also visiting professor at Strasbourg and the Université Libre de Bruxelles (1985) and at Montreal (1988). Among her professional positions were as president of the Romanian Society of Criminology and Criminalistics, and as editor-in-chief of a law review.Stănoiu worked as a secretary of state at the Labour Ministry from 1995 to 1996. She was elected senator three times: in 1996, 2000 and 2004. During her time in the Senate, she was on the committees for human rights, religious affairs and minorities (1996-2000); for revising the Constitution (2000-2004); for investigating abuses, combating corruption and petitions (2004-2006); and for defence, public order and national security (2007-2008). After the PDSR (PSD from 2001) won the 2000 election, incoming Prime Minister Adrian Năstase named her Justice Minister that December. Before the end of 2001, she had dismissed every prosecutor involved in anti-corruption trials and in trials of state officials accused of acts of repression during the bloody Romanian Revolution of 1989 that toppled the Communist regime. In July of that year, President Ion Iliescu appointed Stănoiu's husband to the Constitutional Court, raising fears of nepotism. He and Năstase decided to sack her in March 2004 following calls for her departure from the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) and Democratic Party (PD), comments by a judge accusing her of being personally responsible for ""chaos"" in the justice system and for not wanting genuinely independent judges, and a draft report by the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs criticising Romania for lacking a politically independent judiciary. Right afterwards, Iliescu hired her as a presidential adviser, leading to her resignation from the Senate, as the two positions cannot be held simultaneously. Within her party, Stănoiu was a vice president from 1996 to 2000 and again from 2001.Both during and after Stănoiu's ministerial service, her relationship with the pre-1989 Securitate secret police under Communism came under scrutiny. In autumn 2006, the CNSAS, an institution charged with investigating Securitate affiliations, declared her a collaborator based on a law later found unconstitutional. In response, she challenged the verdict and quit the PSD, joining the PC several months later. According to the CNSAS, while working at the ICJ in the 1980s, Stănoiu, code-named ""Sanda"", signed fifty-one notes reporting information about her colleagues, including her future boss Năstase, to the Securitate. Although graphologists have attested that the handwriting is hers, she claims the notes are forgeries and refuses to comment of whether she collaborated with the secret police. A June 2012 ruling by a court in Oradea, where she requested the case be moved in order to avoid media publicity, upheld the CNSAS verdict, confirming that Stănoiu was ""Sanda"" and did collaborate with the Securitate. The ruling is subject to appeal. In January 2001, her first major appointment while minister was former top Securitate official General Marian Ureche as director of the ministry's intelligence service. Later, he was revealed to have been Securitate supervisor at the ICJ, and she fought to keep him until the extent of his involvement in controversial intelligence work before and after 1989 emerged and led to his ouster in November 2003.
