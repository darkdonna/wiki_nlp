== The project WhyNot? / ProcByNe? ==
As a new MEP, the first thing she thought of was to start concrete projects which would have a direct and immediate impact on European citizens, especially young people. Taking into account the concerning rates of youth unemployment, she decided to launch her personal traineeship programme ""PročBynNe?"" - ""Why not?"". Putting effectively into use the business and academic network that she knows well from her previous profession, she offers around 12 traineeships per year to motivated young people to enable them to strive for their goals as well as to give them assurances that if they want to achieve something in life, they can do it. The selection of youngsters (aged 18–25) is not based on the highest qualifications but on the biggest motivation to do the job.  The traineeships can vary from shadowing for two weeks the Minister of Finance to learning the best recipes of the top chef of the country or mentoring by master craftsmen. A separate website was launched introducing the project - www.procbyne.cz. A further idea is to bring this traineeship scheme from the Czech Republic to other EU countries – using a similar young person-MEP-business/academia formula. It is a symbolic act to help young people to get their first job experience and to show that even by small actions, we can make a difference.
