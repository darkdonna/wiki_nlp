0,"Sviatlana Hieorhiyeuna Tsikhanouskaya (née Pilipchuk; born 11 September 1982) is a Belarusian political activist. After standing as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election against the president Alexander Lukashenko, she has led the political opposition to his authoritarian rule through an oppositional government operating from Lithuania and Poland.
Tsikhanouskaya became an opposition leader after her husband, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, ran as a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential election. He was arrested, along with most other opposition leaders, and, as she was unable to file for the presidency on his behalf, Tsikhanouskaya entered herself into the race as a candidate. Lukashenko allowed her candidacy because he believed that a woman could not form legitimate opposition. She ran on a platform of constitutional reform, seeking free and fair elections with term limits on the presidency, and she pledged to step down once this was implemented. After Lukashenko was declared the victor, she was held by Belarusian authorities and then forced into exile in Lithuania. Election observers consider the election fraudulent, and Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate head of state of Belarus. 
Since fleeing to Lithuania, Tsikhanouskaya has established an oppositional government. She established the Coordination Council in 2020 and the United Transitional Cabinet in 2022. As a representative of a democratic Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya has met with several world leaders in a diplomatic capacity to negotiate sanctions against Lukashenko's government and to deny him recognition as a legitimate head of state. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she has been an advocate of increased Western support for Ukraine, while also warning that Russia's actions should not overshadow opposition to the dictatorship in Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya was tried in absentia by the Belarusian government in 2023 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.


== Early life ==
Sviatlana Pilipchuk was born on 11 September 1982 in the village of Mikashevichy to Hieorhij Ivanavič and Valancina Mikałajeuna Pilipčuk. Her father was a driver at a concrete factory, and her mother was a cafeteria cook. She grew up in a Soviet prefabricated apartment building, where she spent much of her time reading. Among her books were some from the United States, which she read to learn English and learn about the world outside of Belarus.Pilipchuk's village was near the Chernobyl exclusion zone. When she was twelve years old, she was taken to Roscrea, Ireland, by the Chernobyl Lifeline charity, which helped children travel so as to reduce their exposure to radiation. Though Pilipchuk was not as affected by radiation as other students, her proficiency in school earned her a spot. While staying in Ireland, she would translate for the other children. Pilipchuk lived with a host family, the Deanes, who effectively became second parents to her. She returned over the following three summers, and she felt that Ireland was a more cheerful place than Belarus. Even after she stopped visiting Ireland, she has stayed in contact with the Deanes in adulthood.Pilipchuk attended Mozyr State Pedagogical University to study teaching. While she was in Mazyr, she met nightclub owner Syarhei Tsikhanouski in 2003. They married in 2004, and she took the name Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Together they had two children: a son and a daughter, about five years apart. Her son was born mostly deaf, and much of her time went to assisting him. She moved from Minsk to Gomel where he could receive treatment, including a cochlear implant. Until 2020, Tsikhanouskaya was an English teacher and interpreter. She retired so she had more time to raise her children. She pulled her children out of school when the COVID-19 pandemic developed, as the government had not taken any prevention measures.


== 2020 Belarusian presidential election ==


=== Background and building a campaign ===
In 2019, Tsikhanouskaya's husband Tsikhanouski started a YouTube channel, ""A Country for Life"", in which he interviewed people and challenged the rule of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. He became a prominent opposition leader through his YouTube and Telegram presence, as well as his organization of political protests. He moved to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, and he was subsequently arrested for his protest activity days before the filing deadline.: 122–123  Tsikhanouskaya attempted to file for her husband by proxy but was rejected. In response, she filed for her own candidacy.: 123  She later said that she did this solely as a show of support for her husband. Tsikhanouskaya registered as an Independent candidate on 14 July 2020.Tsikhanouskaya initially had no interest in building a campaign. When her husband was released, he continued the campaign even though it was her name on the paperwork. He sometimes brought a life-size cutout of Tsikhanouskaya when he campaigned. She easily acquired the 100,000 signatures that were needed to run—a high limit that was expected to block opposition candidates from running. Her candidacy was confirmed on 19 July 2020. From this day, she traveled across Belarus to hold campaign events.Tsikhanouski was arrested a second time, accused of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was later found to be staged. With her husband imprisoned, Tsikhanouskaya became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko in the presidential election,: 123  making her a rare example of an opposition leader in an autocratic nation that arose through a political campaign.: 120  She aligned with Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of opposition candidate Valery Tsepkalo who had fled the country, and Maria Kalesnikava, the campaign manager of opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested.: 123 2020 was a time of political vulnerability for Lukashenko. He had grown more unpopular because of his mishandling of economic issues and his dismissive response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus.: 122  Most opposition candidates were removed from the race, either through arrest or disqualification.: 123  Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy, believing that as a woman she was not a significant political threat. He instead belittled her for being a female political candidate, using sexist language.: 119  Tsikhanouskaya leaned into the feminine aspects of her candidacy, emphasizing that she was a mother, and her gender may have indicated to voters that she was less likely to seek power for herself.: 124 Instead of running as a protest candidate, encouraging a boycott as her husband had intended, she built a campaign. Tsikhanouskaya described herself as an ""accidental candidate"", and she said that she would only hold office until the Lukashenko dictatorship was seen to an end.: 120  Her role in the campaign was to serve as a face for the opposition movement rather than to engage in politics. Her role has been compared to Joan of Arc by the Belarusian press. She said of the campaign that ""every day was full of fear"".


=== Campaigning ===
Though she was running as an independent candidate, Tsikhanouskaya attracted support from across the spectrum of Belarus's political opposition. Vital Rymasheuski, co-leader of Belarusian Christian Democracy, announced his party's support, as did the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Assembly), United Civic Party of Belarus, and Belarusian Women's Party ""Nadzieja"". She also received support from 2010 presidential candidate Mikola Statkevich, and president of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Ivonka Survilla. Tsikhanouskaya's shared experience with the other wives of arrested dissidents earned her many supporters among women.: 124  Rallies in support of Tsikhanouskaya and in opposition to Lukashenko were the largest in the history of post-Soviet Belarus, attracting crowds of 20,000 in Brest and 220,000 in Minsk. Tsikhanouskaya had no political experience, and she had to be taught how to speak to the media. This endeared her to voters and protesters, who saw her as an ordinary citizen like themselves. Her open dislike of politics fueled this response.During the presidential campaign, Tsikhanouskaya was repeatedly threatened, recounting threatening phone calls from unknown numbers, which said, ""We will put you behind bars and place your children in an orphanage"". Tsikhanouskaya said she then decided to persevere in her campaign, saying that ""there must be a symbol of freedom"". Her campaign began as Amnesty International condemned Belarus's discriminatory treatment of women opposition activists, including threats of sexual violence and threats by authorities to take children away from opposition figures and send them to state-run orphanages. Worried for the safety of her children, Tsikhanouskaya had them hidden abroad in Lithuania.Tsikhanouskaya said that she ran for president out of love, to free her husband from prison. She ran on only three political issues: the release of political prisoners, constitutional limitations on the presidency, and new elections. Once these three things happened, she said, she would step down from the presidency. To reform the constitution, she pledged to set a referendum on returning to the original draft of the 1994 Belarusian constitution, reinstating a limit of two terms for the president. She also vowed to move away from the union treaty with Russia. She said that her main goal was to establish free and fair elections. She viewed the election as illegitimate due to the government's refusal to register Lukashenko's main political opponents as candidates. She pledged to deliver a plan for transparent and accountable elections within six months of taking office.Tsikhanouskaya's economic platform emphasized increasing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses in the Belarusian economy. She planned to offer interest free loans to small and medium-sized businesses, cancel state inspections of private entities, and provide legal protection for foreign investors. She planned to allow profitable state owned enterprises to continue to operate, while requiring unprofitable state owned enterprises to take advice from outside professionals.


=== Election day and departure from Belarus ===
The night before the election, police detained senior staffers from Tsikhanouskaya's campaign and she chose to go into hiding in Minsk, before re-emerging on election day at a polling station. When the results were announced, Tsikhanouskaya officially received only ten percent of the vote. Poll workers were required to engage in electoral fraud to ensure Lukashenko's victory over Tsikhanouskaya,: 125  and protests took place across Belarus in response. According to election monitor Golos and independent observers, Tsikhanouskaya was the legitimate winner of the election. After Belarusian state television released an exit poll showed Lukashenko winning by an overwhelming margin, Tsikhanouskaya said that she didn't trust that poll, saying, ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us"".Tsikhanouskaya and her lawyer went to the Central Election Commission the following day, where they were confronted by armed guards, and Tsikhanouskaya was forced to meet with Lukashenko's enforcer Andrei Pavlyuchenko. She was given an ultimatum to either leave the country, or to go to prison and have her children taken. They described to her in detail what life in prison would be like for her, where political prisoners were frequently tortured, and what life for her children would be like as wards of the state. She attempted to negotiate the release of her husband in exchange for ending her challenge and leaving the country. Her offer was refused, but instead she was able to negotiate the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz. Tsikhanouskaya and Moroz prepared to leave for Lithuania; Tsikhanouskaya collected her passport and her son's cochlear implant equipment, while Moroz arranged to have her own children escorted to Lithuania by her sister. The women also demanded that a Belarusian KGB agent escort them to the border in Moroz's car, to prevent the use of a car bomb.A video was released of Tsikhanouskaya conceding to Lukashenko and asking the protesters to stand down. The stark change in demeanor and message led allies to say that the video had been coerced, with some going as far as to liken it to a hostage video.


== Exile ==


=== Establishing an opposition government-in-exile ===
On 11 August 2020, Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius announced that Tsikhanouskaya was safe in Lithuania while also acknowledging that she had ""few options"". She felt that she had ""betrayed"" her supporters by leaving the country. The same day, the State Security Committee of Belarus alleged that an attempt was being made on Tsikhanouskaya's life, saying that the protesters needed a ""sacred sacrifice"".Days after she left the country, Tsikhanouskaya declared herself the ""leader of democratic Belarus"". To this effect, she announced the establishment of a Coordination Council to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko. Applications for membership in the council were open only to Belarusian authority figures, such as respected professionals, authors, or sportspeople. Tsikhanouskaya considered herself to be an ""interim-leader"" of Belarus, but she has not claimed an entitlement to the presidency. She has indicated that she will not seek the presidency again, instead continuing her diplomatic work until fair elections can be held.Tsikhanouskaya appealed to the international community to recognise her as the winner, traveling to various European capitals and meeting with world leaders, including President Joe Biden, Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron, President Ursula von der Leyen, President Charles Michel, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Western nations and the European Parliament have generally opted not to recognise Lukashenko's reelection. She has also sought sanctions against Belarus, speaking with world leaders in an effort to get them applied. After a period of protest, Lukashenko regained de facto control over the nation. Tsikhanouskaya has denied that she leads a government in exile, saying that she wished to create a ""permanent opposition inside Belarus"". The nation of Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate leader of Belarus.On 9 August 2022, at a conference held in Vilnius, Tsikhanouskaya announced the creation of the United Transitional Cabinet. It initially consisted of Pavel Latushko (responsible for the transition of power), Aliaksandr Azarau (responsible for the restoration of law and order), Valery Kavaleuski (foreign affairs), and Valery Sakhashchyk (defense and national security). Belarus declared Tsikhanouskaya's organizations to be extremist formations in January 2023, making her subject to prison time should she be captured by the Belarusian government. Two months later, she was tried in absentia and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.European Parliament and a number of governments recognize Tsikhanouskaya and her structures as legitimate representative of the Republic of Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya is often referred by foreign government representatives, diplomats and parliamentarians as ""President"", ""President-elect"", ""Leader of Democratic Belarus"", while her Cabinet is referred as ""government in exile.""The Council of Europe, the European Union and the United States of America have established the formal cooperation with the structures of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.


=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

When the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, Tsikhanouskaya sought to promote the anti-war movement in Belarus.: 125  She has objected to the international framing of Belarus as merely a vassal state of Russia, alleging that it downplays the severity of Lukashenko's rule. Regarding Lukashenko's support of the invasion, Tsikhanouskaya accused him of treason.Following Belarus's entry into the war, Tsikhanouskaya and her supporters developed the Pieramoha Plan (Victory Plan), a strategy involving underground dissidents in Belarus, engaging in information sharing and sabotage. She has said that the dissidents must wait until ""the right moment"", when instability allows for a change in power.Tsikhanouskaya argues that the existence of a dictatorship in Belarus threatens the safety not only of Ukraine, but of the other states bordering Belarus: Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as Belarus has been used by Russia to attack neighboring countries like Ukraine. She supports continued political and economic involvement by the West in support of Ukraine's efforts in the Russo-Ukrainian War. She has warned of war fatigue stymieing Western support for Ukraine and Belarusian dissidents.


== Awards ==
Tsikhanouskaya was on the 2020 list of the BBC's 100 Women, announced on 23 November 2020, and was included in the 2020 edition of The Bloomberg 50. Tsikhanouskaya and other Belarusian opposition leaders were awarded the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in a ceremony on 16 December in Brussels. Among dozens of distinctions, she is a recipient of the 2020 Globsec prize for freedom; 2022 International Four Freedoms Award; 2022 International Trailblazer Award; 2022 Tipperary International Peace Award, 2023 IDU Bush-Thatcher Award for Freedom; 2023 NATO PA “Women for Peace and Security” Award; 2023 Anna Lindh Prize laureate. She and other Belarusian opposition leaders won the 2022 Charlemagne Prize.In 2021, she was nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and multiple Norwegian members of parliament.

1,"Olga Mikhailovna Abramova (Belarusian: Вольга Міхайлаўна Абрамава; Russian: О́льга Миха́йловна Абра́мова; born 19 September 1953) is a Belarusian political scientist and politician. A Candidate of Sciences in philosophy, Abramova was member of the House of Representatives from 2000 until 2008, and member of the Supreme Council of the Republic from 1996 to 2001. Although a pro-Russian politician, Ambramova is also a supporter of good relations between Belarus and the West. In her opinion, Alexander Lukashenko's policy enjoys the support of the majority of society. Abramova is critical of some of the leaders of the Belarusian opposition.


== Early life ==
Abramova was born on 19 September 1953 in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union. In 1975, she graduated from the Belarusian State University, receiving education as a sociologist and philosopher. In 1988, she obtained the degree of Candidate of Philosophical Sciences (equivalent to a PhD). The topic of her candidacy thesis was: The humanism of using coercive measures in the socialist revolution. She lectured at the Belarusian State Technological University and the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, and was gradually promoted from assistant to associate professor. In 1995 and from 1997, she was the director of research programs of the National Center for Strategic Initiatives ""East-West"". She worked as the director of scientific and educational programs of the ""Strategia"" analytical center. Abramova speaks German.


== Career ==


=== Start of socio-political activity ===
At the end of the 1980s, Abramova became active in socio-political life. She opposed the transition of the education system to the Belarusian language and strongly opposed the law on languages adopted on 26 January 1990 at the 14th session of the Supreme Soviet, which provided for the establishment of Belarusian as the only state language. She advocated that the Byelorussian SSR should have two state languages: Belarusian and Russian. In 1991–1994 she was co-chair of the Movement for Democratic Reforms of Belarus. She also served as co-chair of the international Democratic Reform Movement.


=== Member of the Supreme Council (1996–2001) ===
In the second round of supplementary parliamentary elections on 10 December 1995, Abramova was elected member of the Supreme Council of Belarus of the 13th term from the Academic Electoral District No. 242 of the city of Minsk. On 19 December 1995, she was registered by the Central Electoral Commission, and on 9 January 1996, she was sworn in as a deputy. From 23 January, she served in the Supreme Council as a member, and then as secretary of the Standing Committee for International Affairs. Abramova was non-partisan; she belonged to the social democratic faction ""Labour Union"". From June 3, she was a member of the working group of the Supreme Council for cooperation with the Bundestag of Germany. On 21 June, she became a member of the council's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Community of Belarus and Russia. In November 1996, during the political crisis related to the referendum initiated by President Alexander Lukashenko, Abramova spoke out against the president, and supported the motion to impeach him. On 27 November 1996, after the president's controversial and partly internationally unrecognized change to the constitution, she was not a member of the House of Representatives of the first term. However, she also sharply criticized the opposition. According to the Constitution of Belarus of 1994, her mandate as a deputy to the Supreme Council ended on 9 January 2001; however, subsequent elections to this body were never held.In 1997, she founded and headed the Belarusian Public Union ""Yabloko"", which brought together Russian-speaking democrats, was centrist, social-liberal in nature and was established with the support of the Russian Yabloko party. The organization coordinated its activities with the Coordination Council of Democratic Forces (RKSD), a body uniting the Belarusian opposition, within the Consultative Council of Opposition Political Parties, through the OSCE Consultation and Observation Mission. In the second half of 1999 and the first half of 2000, the organization led by Abramova participated in talks with the authorities on the democratization of the electoral code before the 2000 parliamentary elections. Representatives of Yabloko participated in the talks until the very end, until July 2000, even after the main opposition parties withdrew from them. Belarusian state media referred to the organization as a ""constructive opposition"".


=== Member of the House of Representatives (2000–2008) ===
Ambramova and her organization did not join the boycott of the parliamentary elections announced on 2 July by the 4th Congress of the RKSD. She put forward her candidacy and on 21 November 2000 and she became a member of the House of Representatives of the 2nd term from the Eastern Electoral District No. 106 of the city of Minsk. She thus became one of two people, next to Vladimir Novosiad, who were elected to the Chamber and who had previously belonged to the opposition in the Supreme Council of the 13th term. Due to her participation in the elections, supporters of the boycott considered her a ""pseudo-democrat"". Shortly after being elected to the Chamber, Abramova joined the pro-presidential camp. She served as a member of the Committee on Legislation and Judicial and Legal Issues. She belonged to the parliamentary group ""Supporting Economic Development"". She was one of two deputies, alongside Iwan Paszkiewicz, who reacted to the letter sent on 3 March 2001 by the leaders of the four main Protestant Churches in Belarus. In the letter, they criticized the new version of the law on freedom of religion, according to which the registration of religious associations was made more difficult, and also expressed concern about the particularly privileged position of the Russian Orthodox Church. The remaining deputies, like members of the Council of the Republic and Alexander Lukashenko, ignored the letter.Abramova took part in the parliamentary elections in 2004. According toJuryja Czawusaua, during the election campaign, she exceeded the funds allocated for agitation by disseminating reports on her parliamentary activities for deputies of the House of Representatives of the second term. There were no cases of the authorities confiscating her election materials, which was the case with the materials of opposition candidates. On 16 November 2004, she became a member of the House of Representatives of the 3rd term from the Kalinowski Electoral District No. 108 of the city of Minsk. She served as a member of the Standing Committee on State Construction, Local Government and Regulations. According to Alaksander Piatkiewicz and Wolf Rubinczyk, in the House of Representatives she showed ""moderate opposition"", i.e. she spoke out against individual repressive actions of the executive power. On 29 June 2005, she was the only member of parliament who voted against the law on social organizations, which, among others, facilitated their liquidation, made registration and operation more difficult, and prohibited the activities of unregistered organizations. Her term in the House of Representatives ended on 27 October 2008.On 30 May 2007, Abramova announced the liquidation of the Belarusian Public Union ""Yabloko"". The reason was two warnings from the Ministry of Justice due to the lack of a legal address for the union. Abramova had stopped renting an office for the union several years earlier due to lack of funds.


== Views ==
According to Abramova, Belarusian national identity consists primarily in the bond with the native land and love for native landscapes. She does not consider the community of Slavs to be an important factor, because in her opinion it is only a community of blood, while the Slavic nations have different cultures and are heading in different directions. However, there is a community of nations of the former Soviet Union, from which Abramova excludes Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, but includes Israelis coming from the territory of the former USSR.Abramova describes herself as a pro-Russian but also pro-European politician. It declares support for maintaining a pragmatic balance between Eastern and Western policies in order to achieve benefits for the country. In her opinion, it is convenient and expedient for Belarus to remain in a military-political alliance with Russia, as well as other organizations in which it is involved, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. However, she stipulates that Belarus should not be part of Russia, as it is advisable for it to also develop good relations with the West. She describes Russia's policy towards Belarus as pragmatic, consistent with its national and state interests and the will of the majority of Russian society. However, she assesses the policy of Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine in this area very negatively. In her opinion, it does not meet the interests of these countries, and the local political elites are conducting it against the will of the majority of their citizens.Europe, in Abramova's opinion, is a community of cultural and civilizational values to which Belarus belongs from the point of view of geography and history, but not in terms of dominant social thought. Belarus should strive to achieve European standards in the field of quality and comfort of life, as well as social security, but should not adopt some civic values. Abramova criticizes what she considers to be too much trust of Europeans in the information provided in the media, their materialistic lifestyle and excessive bureaucracy. According to her, Europeans do not understand the specificity of Belarus and its peculiar national character. She considers European integration to be a generally beneficial process, because European integration is better than economic autarky. Belarus could contribute to it primarily in the fields of culture and science. The ideal variant would be the integration of Russia with European structures. However, in the foreseeable future, Belarus should not make a civilizational choice and wait for the final development of the international order. Abramova explains the negative attitude of the European Union towards Belarusian authorities as a lack of understanding of the processes taking place in the country. In her opinion, the EU's policy is shaped by a part of the Belarusian opposition, which in fact does not want any changes. Abramova also criticizes the EU for the lack of specific material incentives for integration with it.According to Abramova, Belarusian state media idealize the situation in the country, while non-state media exaggerate criticism. In order to avoid a false, one-sided image of Belarus, both sources should be treated with caution. She claims that both political and economic changes are taking place in the country, but we should be more patient while waiting for them. In her opinion, Lukashenko's policies, both domestic and foreign, have the support of the majority of Belarusian society. She is very critical of some of the Belarusian opposition leaders who have turned politics into business. In her opinion, despite loud declarations, they do not want Belarus to be democratized and open to the world, because their current status is comfortable for them. According to Abramova, they shape the European Union's policy towards Belarus.Abramova describes herself as choleric and extrovert.


== Commentary ==
Abramova was described as a ""pseudo-democrat"" by supporters of the boycott of the 2000 parliamentary elections. This happened so that, when the majority of the opposition supported the boycott and Abramova did not join it, she would put forward her candidacy and win the seat as a deputy. Brian Bennett described her in this context as Lukashenko's favorite oppositionist. Zianon Pazniak has been critical of her, calling her a polytrusifier from Lukashenko's ""patka"". According to political scientist Iryna Yekadumava, the ""Yabloko"" organization she led—after right-wing parties refused to contact the authorities that they considered illegal—had a chance in 2001 to capture the electorate of centrist forces, represented by the middle class, intelligentsia, part of the nomenklatura and employees of the state apparatus.

== Press secretary of Alexander Lukashenko ==
In 2014, Natallia Eismant was appointed press secretary of the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. Circumstances of her promotion are unknown. One source claimed that she was introduced to Lukashenko by the beauty queen Daria Shmanai, who accompanied the president. Fashion designer Sasha Varlamov claimed that the sister-in-law Hanna Eismant introduced Natallia to Lukashenko. In 2018, her husband Ivan Eismant was appointed the head of the National State Television and Radio Company.In office she made several controversial statements. In 2019, she advocated dictatorship, claiming it to be ""Belarusian brand"". She said that dictatorship is ""order, discipline and absolutely normal calm life"". In 2020, she claimed that the lack of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic was a thoughtful measure of Lukashenko. On 23 September 2020, Eismant misinformed journalists about the inauguration of Lukashenko: she told that the journalists will be ""surely informed"" about the inauguration, but they learned about the event from the state TV news after the inauguration was held. In November 2021, she voiced a completely different version about content of a phone conversation between Alexander Lukashenko and Angela Merkel which was later disproved by the German authorities.She is considered to be one of the most influential women among the Belarusian authorities. Eismant is reported to have a big impact on Lukashenko. She is reported to maintain the Telegram channel of the president's press service or write to it personally.


== International sanctions ==
On 6 November 2020, the Council of the European Union included Natallia Eismant in the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 765/2006. Her public statements defending Lukashenko and criticizing opposition activists and peaceful protesters were considered as ""seriously undermining democracy and the rule of law in Belarus"". She was banned from visiting European Union and her assets in EU were frozen. Eismant was also sanctioned by the United Kingdom, and Canada.

== Early life and career ==
Kochanova was born on 25 September 1960 in Polotsk. Her father was a blacksmith and her mother worked in a garment factory. She has two brothers. She grew up in a communal apartment and studied at the Novopolotsk Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1982. In 2006, she graduated from the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Belarus.Kochanova worked as a remote control operator at Polotsk's water treatment facility from 1982 until 1987. She was promoted to the public service and was head of the housing department and member of the city's Executive Committee until 2002.


== Early political career ==
In November 2007, Kochanova became mayor of Novopolotsk. Five years later, in 2012, she became Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Commission Council of the National Assembly for legislation and state building. In 2014, Kochanova was appointed Deputy Prime Minister by President Alexander Lukashenko.


== Chief of Staff and Council of the Republic ==
On 21 December 2016, Kochanova was appointed Chief of Staff to the President of Belarus and Head of the Presidential Administration of Belarus by Lukashenko, who is known as Europe's ""last dictator"". At the time Lukashenko called her an ""ardent supporter of the state policy."" She is one of his key supporters and advisors. Political scientist Dmitry Bolkunets has suggested that Kochanova could be seen by Lukashenko as a possible successor. However, Lukashenko himself has previously said that a woman cannot be the President.In December 2019, Lukashenko sent Kochanova to the Council of the Republic under the presidential quota, replacing her as head of the Presidential Administration with former Deputy Chair of the KGB Igor Sergeenko. Kochanova was elected speaker of the Council on 6 December 2019, receiving 59 of the 60 votes. She is the first woman to hold the position.In January 2020, Kochanova met with United Kingdom ambassador Jacqueline Perkins seeking to deepen ties between the two countries. In April 2020, Kochanova was asked by Lukashenko to invite the World Health Organization to assess the performance of Belarus's healthcare system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She said there was no need for emergency measures and the economy should keep working as usual.


== 2020 presidential election and aftermath ==

Kochanova was Chief of Staff for Lukashenko's election campaign in August 2020, who covers the bloody regime and repressions of Lukashenko's forces. After over 7,000 people were arrested during August 2020 protests calling for Lukashenko's resignation after the disputed election, Kochanova spoke on Lukashenko's behalf about the release of 1,000 of those arrested, saying they were now ""under the obligation not to participate in unauthorized activities."" She said, ""We don't need unrest. We don't need war."" On 15 August, thousands of protestors outside the state television building demanded full coverage of the protests. After television staff joined them, Kochanova arrived, but was unable to pacify the crowd. The following day, state television reported on the protests for the first time.Opening the fourth session of the National Assembly on 2 October 2020, Kochanova said, ""The election campaign was held in difficult conditions. We witnessed unconcealed external pressure on our country and the aggravation of an unhealthy public situation by internal destructive forces. People made their choice in support of the incumbent President, in favor of stability, peace, tranquility, and the policy pursued in the country."" She also said, ""Lies and misleading information about the country is being spread ... We, the members of the Council of the Republic, strongly condemn the gross interference of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine and other foreign countries in the internal affairs of Belarus."" Later in October, the Council of Europe issued a statement condemning any further use of violence in Belarus, including ""disproportionate use of force by the authorities against protestors."" Kochanova issued a statement in response, saying the West receives ""one-sided information"" on the situation in Belarus from people who “do not represent the majority of citizens who supported the country’s course during the presidential election."" She said Belarus was ""ready to discuss the situation in the country with foreign partners, subject to mutual respect, objectivity, consideration of the parties’ interests and non-interference with internal affairs.""After the German Bundestag adopted a resolution on 4 November 2020 rejecting the results of the presidential election as neither free nor fair, denying the legitimacy of Lukashenko and calling for a new vote, Kochanova and Chair of the House of Representatives, Vladimir Andreichenko, issued a joint statement. They called the resolution ""blatant interference"" in Belarus' affairs, saying they were ""utterly bewildered"" by German support for open calls for ""terrorist activities"". The statement said, ""By the Resolution the Bundestag undermines the progress achieved in relations between Belarus and Germany, and panders to the mercenary interests of individual politicians who are trying to earn political capital on the image of “fighters for democracy in Belarus” while ignoring the harsh repressive actions of law enforcement agencies in their own country.""In November 2020, Kochanova held an unsuccessful meeting with student protesters at Belarusian State University. She denied vote rigging and torture of those detained, but the students protested her comments. She said, ""I thought that we will come out of here and ... be friends. But I am very saddened by the fact that today the framework of human norms and morality is being shattered ... when an adult woman like me is standing in front of you, and you shout in her face, this is rude and unacceptable."" While answering the students' questions, Kochanova used ""Dulles' Plan"" conspiracy theory to explain the situation in Belarus.On 18 November 2020, Kochanova had a meeting with local deputies and officials of Polotsk and Novopolotsk. According to the leaked audio recording, she claimed that the protests had been organized from abroad, declared the photos of the people beaten by the police to be fake, supported expulsion of students from the universities for political reasons.On 27 November 2020, the Council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly awarded Kochanova with its medal ""For Strengthening Parliamentary Cooperation.""Due to her role, Kochanova was sanctioned by the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland; she is also subject to the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctions. In 2022, she was also blacklisted by Japan, Ukraine and Canada.In 2021, ethnologist Uladzimir Lobač fired from the Polack State University claimed that his forced leave was the result of pressure of Natalya Kochanova and Ihar Marzaliuk on the university.

== Early life ==
Tsepkalo's mother is Evgenia Shesterikova, sister is Natalya Leonyuk. Her grandfather Peter Shesterikov, was a writer, who has a street name in Mogilev named in his memory.In 1998, Tsepkalo graduated from the Faculty of International Relations of the Belarus State University with a degree in International Relations. In 2004–2006 she studied at the Higher School of Management and Business of the Belarusian State Economic University. In 2008, she studied at the National Institute of Small and Medium Enterprises in Hyderabad, India.Tsepkalo works as a business development manager for Microsoft.


== 2020 election activism ==
When Tsepkalo's husband Valery Tsepkalo (a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States) announced his participation in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, Tsepkalo accompanied him on his trips. On 14 July 2020, Valery was denied registration as a presidential candidate in Belarus. Soon after that, the three chief opposition candidates—Valery Tsepkalo, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, and Viktar Babaryka–united their campaigns. Since the unification of these campaigns, Veronica became her husband's representative at the campaign rallies of Tikhanovskaya, while Valery and his children left the country fearing for their safety. In addition, throughout the campaign, Veronica was constantly under pressure from the government: from collecting information in the school where children study. Her sister Natalia Leonyuk was summoned to testify against Valery Tsepkalo.On 30 July 2020, during a rally in Minsk, Veronica spoke about the personal affairs of her family, and cited the falsification of a criminal case against her mother, who at that time was already in a serious medical condition. Fearing the loss of her freedom as a result of political persecution, she fled the country on the eve of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, joining her husband in Moscow. She cast her vote at the Belarusian embassy in Moscow.Following the rigged August 2020 presidential election, in which incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko declared victory, Tsepkalo said that the ""only legitimate President is Svetlana Tikhanovskaya"" and called upon other countries to recognize Tikhanovsakaya as the legitimately elected president of Belarus.On 19 August 2020, it was reported that Tsepkalo was in Poland with her husband and children. Tsepkalo and her family remain in exile in Poland.

13,"Sviatlana Hieorhiyeuna Tsikhanouskaya (née Pilipchuk; born 11 September 1982) is a Belarusian political activist. After standing as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election against the president Alexander Lukashenko, she has led the political opposition to his authoritarian rule through an oppositional government operating from Lithuania and Poland.
Tsikhanouskaya became an opposition leader after her husband, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, ran as a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential election. He was arrested, along with most other opposition leaders, and, as she was unable to file for the presidency on his behalf, Tsikhanouskaya entered herself into the race as a candidate. Lukashenko allowed her candidacy because he believed that a woman could not form legitimate opposition. She ran on a platform of constitutional reform, seeking free and fair elections with term limits on the presidency, and she pledged to step down once this was implemented. After Lukashenko was declared the victor, she was held by Belarusian authorities and then forced into exile in Lithuania. Election observers consider the election fraudulent, and Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate head of state of Belarus. 
Since fleeing to Lithuania, Tsikhanouskaya has established an oppositional government. She established the Coordination Council in 2020 and the United Transitional Cabinet in 2022. As a representative of a democratic Belarus, Tsikhanouskaya has met with several world leaders in a diplomatic capacity to negotiate sanctions against Lukashenko's government and to deny him recognition as a legitimate head of state. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she has been an advocate of increased Western support for Ukraine, while also warning that Russia's actions should not overshadow opposition to the dictatorship in Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya was tried in absentia by the Belarusian government in 2023 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.


== Early life ==
Sviatlana Pilipchuk was born on 11 September 1982 in the village of Mikashevichy to Hieorhij Ivanavič and Valancina Mikałajeuna Pilipčuk. Her father was a driver at a concrete factory, and her mother was a cafeteria cook. She grew up in a Soviet prefabricated apartment building, where she spent much of her time reading. Among her books were some from the United States, which she read to learn English and learn about the world outside of Belarus.Pilipchuk's village was near the Chernobyl exclusion zone. When she was twelve years old, she was taken to Roscrea, Ireland, by the Chernobyl Lifeline charity, which helped children travel so as to reduce their exposure to radiation. Though Pilipchuk was not as affected by radiation as other students, her proficiency in school earned her a spot. While staying in Ireland, she would translate for the other children. Pilipchuk lived with a host family, the Deanes, who effectively became second parents to her. She returned over the following three summers, and she felt that Ireland was a more cheerful place than Belarus. Even after she stopped visiting Ireland, she has stayed in contact with the Deanes in adulthood.Pilipchuk attended Mozyr State Pedagogical University to study teaching. While she was in Mazyr, she met nightclub owner Syarhei Tsikhanouski in 2003. They married in 2004, and she took the name Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Together they had two children: a son and a daughter, about five years apart. Her son was born mostly deaf, and much of her time went to assisting him. She moved from Minsk to Gomel where he could receive treatment, including a cochlear implant. Until 2020, Tsikhanouskaya was an English teacher and interpreter. She retired so she had more time to raise her children. She pulled her children out of school when the COVID-19 pandemic developed, as the government had not taken any prevention measures.


== 2020 Belarusian presidential election ==


=== Background and building a campaign ===
In 2019, Tsikhanouskaya's husband Tsikhanouski started a YouTube channel, ""A Country for Life"", in which he interviewed people and challenged the rule of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. He became a prominent opposition leader through his YouTube and Telegram presence, as well as his organization of political protests. He moved to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, and he was subsequently arrested for his protest activity days before the filing deadline.: 122–123  Tsikhanouskaya attempted to file for her husband by proxy but was rejected. In response, she filed for her own candidacy.: 123  She later said that she did this solely as a show of support for her husband. Tsikhanouskaya registered as an Independent candidate on 14 July 2020.Tsikhanouskaya initially had no interest in building a campaign. When her husband was released, he continued the campaign even though it was her name on the paperwork. He sometimes brought a life-size cutout of Tsikhanouskaya when he campaigned. She easily acquired the 100,000 signatures that were needed to run—a high limit that was expected to block opposition candidates from running. Her candidacy was confirmed on 19 July 2020. From this day, she traveled across Belarus to hold campaign events.Tsikhanouski was arrested a second time, accused of assaulting a police officer in an incident that was later found to be staged. With her husband imprisoned, Tsikhanouskaya became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko in the presidential election,: 123  making her a rare example of an opposition leader in an autocratic nation that arose through a political campaign.: 120  She aligned with Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of opposition candidate Valery Tsepkalo who had fled the country, and Maria Kalesnikava, the campaign manager of opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested.: 123 2020 was a time of political vulnerability for Lukashenko. He had grown more unpopular because of his mishandling of economic issues and his dismissive response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus.: 122  Most opposition candidates were removed from the race, either through arrest or disqualification.: 123  Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya's candidacy, believing that as a woman she was not a significant political threat. He instead belittled her for being a female political candidate, using sexist language.: 119  Tsikhanouskaya leaned into the feminine aspects of her candidacy, emphasizing that she was a mother, and her gender may have indicated to voters that she was less likely to seek power for herself.: 124 Instead of running as a protest candidate, encouraging a boycott as her husband had intended, she built a campaign. Tsikhanouskaya described herself as an ""accidental candidate"", and she said that she would only hold office until the Lukashenko dictatorship was seen to an end.: 120  Her role in the campaign was to serve as a face for the opposition movement rather than to engage in politics. Her role has been compared to Joan of Arc by the Belarusian press. She said of the campaign that ""every day was full of fear"".


=== Campaigning ===
Though she was running as an independent candidate, Tsikhanouskaya attracted support from across the spectrum of Belarus's political opposition. Vital Rymasheuski, co-leader of Belarusian Christian Democracy, announced his party's support, as did the Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Assembly), United Civic Party of Belarus, and Belarusian Women's Party ""Nadzieja"". She also received support from 2010 presidential candidate Mikola Statkevich, and president of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Ivonka Survilla. Tsikhanouskaya's shared experience with the other wives of arrested dissidents earned her many supporters among women.: 124  Rallies in support of Tsikhanouskaya and in opposition to Lukashenko were the largest in the history of post-Soviet Belarus, attracting crowds of 20,000 in Brest and 220,000 in Minsk. Tsikhanouskaya had no political experience, and she had to be taught how to speak to the media. This endeared her to voters and protesters, who saw her as an ordinary citizen like themselves. Her open dislike of politics fueled this response.During the presidential campaign, Tsikhanouskaya was repeatedly threatened, recounting threatening phone calls from unknown numbers, which said, ""We will put you behind bars and place your children in an orphanage"". Tsikhanouskaya said she then decided to persevere in her campaign, saying that ""there must be a symbol of freedom"". Her campaign began as Amnesty International condemned Belarus's discriminatory treatment of women opposition activists, including threats of sexual violence and threats by authorities to take children away from opposition figures and send them to state-run orphanages. Worried for the safety of her children, Tsikhanouskaya had them hidden abroad in Lithuania.Tsikhanouskaya said that she ran for president out of love, to free her husband from prison. She ran on only three political issues: the release of political prisoners, constitutional limitations on the presidency, and new elections. Once these three things happened, she said, she would step down from the presidency. To reform the constitution, she pledged to set a referendum on returning to the original draft of the 1994 Belarusian constitution, reinstating a limit of two terms for the president. She also vowed to move away from the union treaty with Russia. She said that her main goal was to establish free and fair elections. She viewed the election as illegitimate due to the government's refusal to register Lukashenko's main political opponents as candidates. She pledged to deliver a plan for transparent and accountable elections within six months of taking office.Tsikhanouskaya's economic platform emphasized increasing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses in the Belarusian economy. She planned to offer interest free loans to small and medium-sized businesses, cancel state inspections of private entities, and provide legal protection for foreign investors. She planned to allow profitable state owned enterprises to continue to operate, while requiring unprofitable state owned enterprises to take advice from outside professionals.


=== Election day and departure from Belarus ===
The night before the election, police detained senior staffers from Tsikhanouskaya's campaign and she chose to go into hiding in Minsk, before re-emerging on election day at a polling station. When the results were announced, Tsikhanouskaya officially received only ten percent of the vote. Poll workers were required to engage in electoral fraud to ensure Lukashenko's victory over Tsikhanouskaya,: 125  and protests took place across Belarus in response. According to election monitor Golos and independent observers, Tsikhanouskaya was the legitimate winner of the election. After Belarusian state television released an exit poll showed Lukashenko winning by an overwhelming margin, Tsikhanouskaya said that she didn't trust that poll, saying, ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us"".Tsikhanouskaya and her lawyer went to the Central Election Commission the following day, where they were confronted by armed guards, and Tsikhanouskaya was forced to meet with Lukashenko's enforcer Andrei Pavlyuchenko. She was given an ultimatum to either leave the country, or to go to prison and have her children taken. They described to her in detail what life in prison would be like for her, where political prisoners were frequently tortured, and what life for her children would be like as wards of the state. She attempted to negotiate the release of her husband in exchange for ending her challenge and leaving the country. Her offer was refused, but instead she was able to negotiate the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz. Tsikhanouskaya and Moroz prepared to leave for Lithuania; Tsikhanouskaya collected her passport and her son's cochlear implant equipment, while Moroz arranged to have her own children escorted to Lithuania by her sister. The women also demanded that a Belarusian KGB agent escort them to the border in Moroz's car, to prevent the use of a car bomb.A video was released of Tsikhanouskaya conceding to Lukashenko and asking the protesters to stand down. The stark change in demeanor and message led allies to say that the video had been coerced, with some going as far as to liken it to a hostage video.


== Exile ==


=== Establishing an opposition government-in-exile ===
On 11 August 2020, Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius announced that Tsikhanouskaya was safe in Lithuania while also acknowledging that she had ""few options"". She felt that she had ""betrayed"" her supporters by leaving the country. The same day, the State Security Committee of Belarus alleged that an attempt was being made on Tsikhanouskaya's life, saying that the protesters needed a ""sacred sacrifice"".Days after she left the country, Tsikhanouskaya declared herself the ""leader of democratic Belarus"". To this effect, she announced the establishment of a Coordination Council to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko. Applications for membership in the council were open only to Belarusian authority figures, such as respected professionals, authors, or sportspeople. Tsikhanouskaya considered herself to be an ""interim-leader"" of Belarus, but she has not claimed an entitlement to the presidency. She has indicated that she will not seek the presidency again, instead continuing her diplomatic work until fair elections can be held.Tsikhanouskaya appealed to the international community to recognise her as the winner, traveling to various European capitals and meeting with world leaders, including President Joe Biden, Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron, President Ursula von der Leyen, President Charles Michel, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Western nations and the European Parliament have generally opted not to recognise Lukashenko's reelection. She has also sought sanctions against Belarus, speaking with world leaders in an effort to get them applied. After a period of protest, Lukashenko regained de facto control over the nation. Tsikhanouskaya has denied that she leads a government in exile, saying that she wished to create a ""permanent opposition inside Belarus"". The nation of Lithuania has recognized Tsikhanouskaya as the legitimate leader of Belarus.On 9 August 2022, at a conference held in Vilnius, Tsikhanouskaya announced the creation of the United Transitional Cabinet. It initially consisted of Pavel Latushko (responsible for the transition of power), Aliaksandr Azarau (responsible for the restoration of law and order), Valery Kavaleuski (foreign affairs), and Valery Sakhashchyk (defense and national security). Belarus declared Tsikhanouskaya's organizations to be extremist formations in January 2023, making her subject to prison time should she be captured by the Belarusian government. Two months later, she was tried in absentia and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.European Parliament and a number of governments recognize Tsikhanouskaya and her structures as legitimate representative of the Republic of Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya is often referred by foreign government representatives, diplomats and parliamentarians as ""President"", ""President-elect"", ""Leader of Democratic Belarus"", while her Cabinet is referred as ""government in exile.""The Council of Europe, the European Union and the United States of America have established the formal cooperation with the structures of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.


=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

When the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, Tsikhanouskaya sought to promote the anti-war movement in Belarus.: 125  She has objected to the international framing of Belarus as merely a vassal state of Russia, alleging that it downplays the severity of Lukashenko's rule. Regarding Lukashenko's support of the invasion, Tsikhanouskaya accused him of treason.Following Belarus's entry into the war, Tsikhanouskaya and her supporters developed the Pieramoha Plan (Victory Plan), a strategy involving underground dissidents in Belarus, engaging in information sharing and sabotage. She has said that the dissidents must wait until ""the right moment"", when instability allows for a change in power.Tsikhanouskaya argues that the existence of a dictatorship in Belarus threatens the safety not only of Ukraine, but of the other states bordering Belarus: Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as Belarus has been used by Russia to attack neighboring countries like Ukraine. She supports continued political and economic involvement by the West in support of Ukraine's efforts in the Russo-Ukrainian War. She has warned of war fatigue stymieing Western support for Ukraine and Belarusian dissidents.


== Awards ==
Tsikhanouskaya was on the 2020 list of the BBC's 100 Women, announced on 23 November 2020, and was included in the 2020 edition of The Bloomberg 50. Tsikhanouskaya and other Belarusian opposition leaders were awarded the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in a ceremony on 16 December in Brussels. Among dozens of distinctions, she is a recipient of the 2020 Globsec prize for freedom; 2022 International Four Freedoms Award; 2022 International Trailblazer Award; 2022 Tipperary International Peace Award, 2023 IDU Bush-Thatcher Award for Freedom; 2023 NATO PA “Women for Peace and Security” Award; 2023 Anna Lindh Prize laureate. She and other Belarusian opposition leaders won the 2022 Charlemagne Prize.In 2021, she was nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and multiple Norwegian members of parliament.

She was a member of the Central Election Commission of Belarus (1992–1996), and Chairwoman (1996–2021).


== Biography ==
Yermoshina was born in Slutsk, Minsk Region on 29 January 1953. In 1975, she graduated from the Faculty of Law at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University. Beginning in 1975, she worked as a legal advisor until becoming an attorney's assistant in 1987. She became Chairwoman of the Judiciary of the City Executive Committee of Babruysk in 1988, a post she held until 1996.


=== Belarusian elections ===
She has been a member of the Central Election Commission of Belarus since 1992, and Chairwoman of the organization since 1996. She was appointed by decree by Alexander Lukashenko in contradiction with the Constitution of Belarus, which stated that the candidacy of the Chairman of the CEC must be approved by the Supreme Council of Belarus. The previous Chairman, Viktar Hanchar, had been an active critic of the 1996 Belarusian referendum and was removed by Lukashenko after serving just little over a month.
In 2004, following the 2004 Belarusian parliamentary election and constitutional referendum, Yermoshina was banned from entering the European Union for allegedly participating in the manipulation of the results of the presidential election. Following the same accusations, in 2006, the United States included her in the sanction list as well. The ban was lifted in 2008.On 15 December 2010, presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov logged a legal complaint application to the Central Election Commission of Belarus, demanding they remove Yermoshyna from her office as Chairperson of the Central Election Commission. He cited that her position was illegal, as Yermoshyna was a member of incumbent Aleksandr Lukashenko's political team, compromising her neutrality, and was under international scrutiny for purportedly rigging the previous election. The complaints were ineffective. Yermoshina was again sanctioned by the European Union in the aftermath of the 2010 election; these sanctions were suspended in 2015 and lifted in 2016.On 9 August 2020, Yermoshina appeared on Belarusian TV to condemn the ""deliberate provocations"" of protest voters in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. She also described long queues outside polling stations as an attempt at ""sabotage"" by the opposition.Independent observers of the election have noted vote counting irregularities and dozens have been subject to harassment and detention. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the elections as ""neither free nor fair."" After the election and the subsequent protests, Yermoshina was banned from entering the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada.Yermoshina was replaced by the former Minister of Education Ihar Karpenka on 13 December 2021.
