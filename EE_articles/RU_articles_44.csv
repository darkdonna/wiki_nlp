0,"Tatyana Vladimirovna Bakalchuk (Russian: Татья́на Влади́мировна Бакальчу́к; née Kim, Russian: Ким, Korean: 김; born on 16 October 1975) is a Russian entrepreneur, founder and CEO of Wildberries,  the largest Russian online retailer, and the country's first self-made woman billionaire. In October 2023, her fortune was estimated at $7 billion.In 2021, the government of Ukraine imposed sanctions over Tatyana and Vladislav Bakalchuk and Wildberries for selling Russian military uniforms and anti-Ukrainian literature. In 2022, Poland also imposed sanctions on Wildberries and Bakalchuk because of the latter’s connections with VTB Bank.


== Early life ==
Tatiana Bakalchuk was born on October 16, 1975, in a Koryo-saram family. She finished school in Moscow oblast and graduated from Kolomna University. She planned to move to Moscow and continue her education as a designer. Still, she had to abandon that plan and return to teaching English when the 1998 financial crisis struck Russia. Tatyana Bakalchuk was an English teacher.In the early 2000s, she met her future husband Vladislav Bakalchuk, an entrepreneur and a founder of Utech ISP. In 2004, after giving birth to her first child, Bakalchuk launched Wildberries, which initially focused on reselling apparel from Otto and Quelle catalogs.According to the company’s official history, Bakalchuk started the business without capital, experience, or professional education. However, she obtained starting capital from her husband, Vladislav Bakalchuk. Notably, this sum was estimated at several million dollars. Shortly before that, he sold the Internet provider UTech to Gazprombank for 7,5 million dollars.The Bell's source claims that the Bakalchuks did not initially sell clothes solely from Otto or Quelle catalogs. Namely, they also sold garments in a second-hand store in the “Dynamite” shopping center in the Vykhino-Zhulebino District. The store was marketed as an outlet with 1000 models of second-hand clothes from Europe. Some of the items were also distributed through a webpage. In 2003, the shopping center’s address was listed in the contacts of the D-Luxe catalog made by Bakalchuk’s and Fadeev’s UT Design studio. Contrary to this, Wildberries claims that the second-hand store was not affiliated with the company.


== Career ==
By 2006, Wildberries got an office in Milkovo, Moscow region, a team of couriers, phone operators, and an IT crew. By that time, the company started to sell apparel by small local European brands and the excess stock of old collections of well-known brands. Wildberries was among the first Russian e-commerce companies to offer a flat delivery rate and free try-on and to build a network of pick-up points with fitting rooms. By 2020, the company operated over 7,000 pick-up points.During the 2014—2016 financial crisis, Wildberries switched to a platform business model (the one employed by Amazon). The company benefited from the dramatic increase in online orders during the COVID-19 pandemic (starting in 2020).Moreover, Tatyana Bakalchuk established WILDBERRIES HOLDINGS LTD in Cyprus in 2018.Tatiana and Vladislav Bakalchuk own Wildberries. By 2022, according to a Data Insight report, Wildberries was the largest e-store in Russia. In 2019, the company's value was estimated at $1 billion, which made Bakalchuk the second woman in Russia to become a billionaire, and by 2020, she became the wealthiest woman in Russia, worth $1.4 billion. Forbes US edition praised Bakalchuk as one of the most notable new billionaires. By 2021, her fortune grew by 800% (compared to 2020) to $13 billion. It is believed that Denis Manturov and Mikhail Mishustin are the patrons of Wildberries.Headed by Manturov, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade drafted a government decree in 2020. The decree proposed to subsidize Russian marketplaces’ logistics expenses. The absence of foreign shareholders was the primary condition for receiving governmental support. Consequently, only one marketplace – Wildberries – could meet these criteria.Moreover, in 2020, Tatyana Bakalchuk acquired Standard-Credit Bank, which Samvel Karapetyan's Tashir Holding previously controlled. The bank was renamed Wildberries Bank. According to information from the ""Banki.ru"" webpage, in October-November the same year, the bank’s net assets decreased by 31,4 million rubles, and its loan portfolio lost almost 23,5 million rubles. Furthermore, according to the ""Bank Analysis"" website, at the beginning of 2022, more than 65% of Standard-Credit's assets consisted of credits. Some media argue that the bank's purchase was necessary to withdraw cash from the debt-ridden retailer.From 2021 to 2022, Bakalchuk was a member of the Supervisory Board of VTB Bank, which is an entirely pro-Kremlin bank. In December 2021, she joined the All-Russia People's Front.In 2021, the Russian Ministry of Digital Development added four new categories (including e-commerce) to the list of preinstalled applications. Only Wildberries could meet the proposed criteria.In 2022, the Ministry of Industry and Trade publicly stated that the online market Wildberries sells counterfeit products.After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Bakalchuk was reportedly personally involved in talks with the Russian Federal AntiMonopoly Service over the legalising parallel imports (importing products from abroad without the permission of the trademark owner).The sales turnover of Wildberries increased in 2022. Compared to 2021, it grew by 98% and amounted to 1,669 trillion rubles. This sum constitutes one-third of the total sales turnover of Russian online commerce in 2022.In April 2023, Tatyana Bakalchuk announced the search for a new Russian-language brand instead of Wildberries due to the ban on using foreign words in Russian advertising. In 2022, the marketplace changed the name of its website to Yagodki for one day as part of a marketing campaign.


== Sanctions ==
In 2021, the government of Ukraine imposed sanctions over Tatyana and Vladislav Bakalchuk and Wildberries for selling Russian military uniforms and anti-Ukrainian literature.After the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland added Wildberries and Bakalchuk to its sanctions list because of Bakalchul’s connections with VTB Bank.


== Forbes ranking ==
Tatyana Bakalchuk is the richest woman in Russia. Along with Yelena Baturina, they are the only two female billionaires in the country. In December 2021, Forbes named Tatyana Bakalchuk, who owns 99 percent of the Wildberries e-commerce platform, the wealth growth dynamic leader among the world's billionaires. In 2021, her business grew by over 1,000 percent. Until December 31, 2019, Tatyana was the sole owner, but then she transferred 1% to her husband Vladislav Bakalchuk, thus moving their family to the first place in the Forbes ranking of Russia's richest families—ahead of the Rotenbergs. According to experts, transferring a share of the property is purely technical. Under Russian legislation, organizations with a sole owner cannot create 100% subsidiaries. The joint ownership of the company will enable Wildberries to create subsidiaries under a simplified procedure, building the structure of a more successful corporation.


== Personal life ==
She is married to Vladislav Bakalchuk, they have seven children, and live in Moscow.Bakalchuk has a sister - Maria Andreeva (née Kim). According to information from her social networks, Andreeva works at Wildberries and has another sister, 20-year-old Albina Tsoy. In turn, Tsoy listed Maxim and Nadezhda Kim among her close relatives. They are also Wildberries employees.Tatyana Bakalchuk’s brother, Yuri Tsoy, is a former CEO of Starprofi. He is a nephew of Sergei Tsoy - Rosneft vice president and former head of Yury Luzhkov's press service. Sergei Tsoy’s wife, Anna Kim, is known by the pseudonym Anita Tsoy. She is believed to be a family friend of Rosneft head Igor Sechin.

At the period of their co-working the relationships were purely professional. In one of her interviews Baturina remembers: ""We never even thought about anything like that when we were working together, it all happened much later"". Baturina and Luzhkov married in 1991. The next year, he became mayor of Moscow. In 2010, he was dismissed by President Dmitry Medvedev amidst still unproven accusations of corruption and mismanagement voiced on state run television.After her husband's dismissal, Baturina moved to London.

== Career ==


=== Inteco ===
In 1989, Baturina launched her first enterprise with her elder brother Victor, primarily dealing with computer software and hardware. In 1991 Baturina founded her company, Inteco (""Inteko"" (Интеко) in Russian), which focused on construction though it began as a plastics business. In 1994, Inteco purchased a plastic factory. In 1998, the company won the contract for producing 85,000 seats for Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow's largest stadium. The critics claimed that the decision was affected by Luzhkov as Mayor of Moscow, though Inteco stated that their price was 50% less than their nearest competitor's.In the middle of 1990s, Inteco entered the construction business focusing on development of advanced materials and technologies for facade work, cement, brick and poured concrete construction, architectural design and real estate business.In 2001, Inteco acquired from a private person the controlling stake in one of the leading housebuilding factories in Moscow DSK-3. Following modernization the construction plant provided 500,000 square meters of housing per year. This acquisition, according to Baturina's interviews, became the starting point for the company's major construction activity. ""DSK-3 is my first real step into construction. I had been viewing the market for a long time. I saw how quickly and dynamically it was developing, how many opportunities it was offering. Still the deal took place sort of accidentally. The lawyers of the former main owner's widow came to me and said that some unfriendly entities were questioning her property rights and trying to simply rob her of her stake. And the frightened woman had decided to sell all the shares to Inteco on the condition that we defend her rights in court. We have successfully managed that and just like that, almost by accident, became the owners of the plant.""At one point, Inteco was said to control 20% of construction in the capital. However, according to experts, quoted by media, from 2000 to 2010 of construction activities Inteco's share in the state order was no more than 2%. While the main contractors for the implementation of the Moscow government orders were construction companies MFS-6 (24.5%) Glavmosstroy (20.7%), SU-155 (13.7%) and MSM-5 (12.2%). In 2002, Inteco created a subsidiary ""Strategy Construction Company"", whose main objective was the construction of monolithic buildings. Such cement plants as ""Podgorensky cementnik"" and ""Oskolcement"", one of the largest cement producers in the central Russia, were also bought at that time.In 2005, Inteco sold its cement works for estimated US$800 000 to Eurocement Group in order to consolidate financial and administrative recourses that the company needed for the implementation of perspective construction programs.In 2006, Baturina was appointed Deputy Head for the inter-ministerial group under the national project ""Affordable and Comfortable Housing for Russian citizens"".Shortly afterwards, Inteco sold DSK-3, a producer of prefabricated buildings, as well and fully concentrated on the construction of monolithic housing and commercial real estate.Part of the proceeds from the sale of these assets were directed by Baturina to buying some high-yield ""blue chips"" of the largest Russian companies such as Gazprom and Sberbank. This step allowed the visionary businesswoman to later sell the shares in the crisis year of 2009 at a significant profit and return Inteco's earlier business development bank loans ahead of schedule, which allowed to keep the businesses afloat. The interest rate on loans at that time sprang up from 10.8 to 18 percent, which led to the ruin of a significant number of Russian developers.At the same time, as part of a new cement project, Inteco purchased Verkhnebakansky Cement Plant and the Atakaytsement cement factory located in the Krasnodar region.As of 2007, the company owned such entities as Inteko Plast (55%), Bistro Plast (50%), construction firms SK DSK-3 (100%), Styre (100%), Inteco CENTER (100%), Inteco Chess (Elista, 100%), Intekostroy (70%). The company also owned enterprises in the city of Sochi - Park (100%), The Matrix (100%), Sochi AO (75.58%), Horizont (50%), Selectioner (Belgorod region., 100%) and Uspensky Agromashplast (Moscow reg., Uspensky, 38%). Inteco Group also included Russian Zemelny Bank and trading house Moscow River involved in the supply of grain.In 2007, the company's revenue, according to its own data, amounted to $1 billion.At the end of 2008, along with Gazprom and Russian Railways, Inteco was included into the list of 295 strategic enterprises of the country.In 2009, the company begins cooperating with an outstanding Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill as part of the programme aimed at creating fundamentally new systems for mass housing in Russia.In 2010, Inteco launched the construction of the second academic building for the Moscow State University named after Lomonosov.In 2010, Baturina was named one of the largest taxpayers in Russia, the taxes to the state budget for 2009 amounted to 4 billion rubles. As of 2009, 99% of the company is owned by Baturina, 1% is on the balance sheet of the Company itself. The project development portfolio is more than 7,000,000 square meters, the cement capacities exceed 0.6 million tons per year.At the end of 2010, Baturina sold its Russian Zemelny Bank (RZB) to foreign investors.The most significant completed projects of Inteco in Moscow (in the period of company Baturina's ownership) are: the residential quarter ""Shuvalov"" (270,000 square meters), the residential quarter ""Grand Park"" (400,000 square meters), the residential site ""Volga"" (400,000 square meters), the multifunctional complex ""Fusion Park"" with the ""Autoville"" - museum of unique cars from private collections (100,000 square meters), the Fundamental Library (60,000 square feet), and the academic building for Humanities (100,000 square meters) of the Moscow State University.After her husband's resignation, Baturina started selling her assets in Russia. The best offer was filed by Mikail Shishkhanov and Sberbank Investments. They bought the 95% and 5% shares of Inteco correspondingly. The exact amount of the transaction was never disclosed, but the report of Sberbank stated that according to the experts that participated in the preparation of the deal, the market value of Inteco, its projects and structures was around 1.2 billion dollars. The deal did not include the cement plants of Inteco. One of them was later sold to Lev Kvetnoy for estimated 17 billion rubles.

=== Allegations of Criminal Links ===
According to leaked diplomatic cables, the US ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, reported allegations that Baturina had links to major criminal groups, particularly Solntsevskaya Bratva. The full text of the cable makes clear that Mr Beyrle is simply repeating gossip and allegations conveyed to him by journalist Sergei Kanev. Beyrle writes, 'Kanev told us that Luzhkov's wife, Yelena Baturina, definitely has links to the criminal world, and particularly to the Solntsevo criminal group'. Beyrle stated that her husband Yury Luzhkov sat on top of a ""pyramid of corruption"". ""Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour,"" wrote Beyrle. ""Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world. Luzhkov is at the top. The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level. Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."" Beyrle also suggested that much of Luzhkov's business empire had been acquired using municipal finances to invest in ""less than transparent"" projects with former Soviet republics. The couple denied the accusations as ""total rubbish"".

3,"Maria Valeryevna Butina (Russian: Мари́я Вале́рьевна Бу́тина, sometimes transliterated as Mariya Butina; born November 10, 1988) is a Russian politician, political activist, journalist, and former entrepreneur who was convicted in 2018 of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia within the United States.Butina worked as an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin; a former member of the Federation Council, member of Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, and deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. In this role, she worked to infiltrate conservative groups in the US, including the National Rifle Association, as part of an effort to promote Russian interests in the 2016 United States presidential election. The Senate Intelligence Committee later concluded that she attempted to persuade the Trump campaign to establish a secret communications back channel with Russia.In July 2018, while residing in Washington, D.C., Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with acting as an agent of the Russian Federation ""without prior notification to the Attorney General."" In December 2018, she pleaded guilty to felony charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent of the Russian state under 18 U.S.C. §951. In April 2019, a federal judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison. She served around five months at Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution. Her 9-month pretrial prison term was counted towards her sentence. She was released and deported back to Russia in October 2019. She publicly denied being a Russian spy. In 2021, she was elected to the State Duma as a member of United Russia.


== Early life and education ==
Butina was born on November 10, 1988, in the Siberian city of Barnaul, in Altai Krai, about 210 miles (340 km) east of the present Kazakhstan–Russia border. Her mother was the chief engineer of an energy enterprise and her father Valery Viktorovich Butin was an entrepreneur who established a furniture manufacturing business in Barnaul. She has one sister and one maternal niece, Kira.She graduated with honors at the age of 17 from Gymnasium Number 22 with in-depth study of the English language, and from school years she strove for active public activity. She studied political science at Altai State University and also received a teaching degree. At age 19, she was elected to the public council of Altai Krai in the last direct election for the council.


== Business and political career ==
Butina, at age 21, launched a furniture retail business in Altai Krai. In 2011, she moved to Moscow and sold six of her seven furniture stores to start an advertising agency.Further in 2011, Butina founded Right to Bear Arms (Russian: Право на оружие), described as a Russian gun-rights organization. She began traveling back and forth to the US, initially with Aleksandr Torshin, who was then a Senator in the Federation Council of Russia (and a half-month later became Acting Chairman/Speaker of this Senate of Russian Federation) and a leading member of United Russia. He had hired her as his ""special assistant"" that year. In 2012, they lobbied the council to expand gun rights. Butina resigned from her position as the head of Right to Bear Arms in late 2014.According to Russians interviewed by RFE/RL, the organization was notable for avoiding opposition to Putin during the 2011–2013 Russian protests, for its ""quixotic"" support for a cause with little public support and strong government opposition – Putin himself had told Russians ""I am deeply convinced that the free flow of firearms will bring a great harm and represents a great danger for us"" – for introducing legislation in the Russian parliament that ""never went anywhere"", and for receding from public view after Butina stepped down as its head. According to US prosecutors who prosecuted Butina on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, her love of guns was a ruse to advance Russia's agenda within the Republican Party. Anders Åslund described Right to Bear Arms as a ""front organization with the purpose of infiltrating American groups and forging cooperation with the National Rifle Association of America.""In 2013, she met Republican political operative Paul Erickson in Russia. The two became close, started dating, and eventually moved in together. In 2015, she emailed him a description of a proposed project to influence the Republican Party to be friendlier to Russia, through the NRA. In January 2015, Torshin became deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, and Butina worked as his special assistant until May 2017. In 2017, Butina told The Washington Post that she never worked for the Russian government.In August 2016, she moved to the US on a student visa, and enrolled as a graduate student in International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C. While a student at American University, Butina got drunk on at least two separate occasions and bragged to her fellow students about her contacts in the Russian government; on both occasions, her classmates reported her to law enforcement, sources told CNN.In February 2016, Butina and Erickson began a South Dakota business, Bridges LLC. Erickson later said the company was established in case Butina needed any monetary assistance for her graduate studies, which Butina commenced in mid-2016 American University in Washington, D.C. In 2018, she completed a master's degree in international relations.


== Involvement in U.S. politics ==


=== National Rifle Association ===
As part of her work as a foreign agent, Butina worked to infiltrate the National Rifle Association on behalf of Russia.Torshin and Butina established a cooperative relationship between the NRA and Right to Bear Arms. Torshin has attended NRA annual meetings in the United States since at least 2011. Following the 2011 meeting, then NRA President David Keene expressed his support for Torshin's ""endeavors"" and extended an invitation to the 2012 meeting. Torshin also attended NRA annual meetings in 2012 and 2013.
Butina and Torshin attended the 2014 NRA annual meeting as special guests of former NRA president Keene. Butina attended the Women's Leadership Luncheon at the 2014 meeting as a guest of former NRA president Sandy Froman. Butina presented to then NRA president Jim Porter a plaque from Right to Bear Arms. Afterwards, she tweeted ""Mission accomplished"". Butina and Torshin also attended the 2015 NRA annual convention.In 2015, a number of NRA officials attended Right to Bear Arms's annual gun conference in Russia. Among them were Keene, gun manufacturer and NRA first vice president Pete Brownell, conservative American political operative Paul Erickson, and Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. One of their hosts was Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who in 2014 was sanctioned by the White House following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Clarke's trip cost $40,000, with all expenses paid by the NRA, Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and Right to Bear Arms. According to a disclosure Clarke filed, Right to Bear Arms paid $6,000 to cover his meals, lodging, transportation and other expenses. During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Torshin spoke. In November 2016, Torshin tweeted that he and Butina were lifetime NRA members.


=== Republican Party ===
Butina has attempted to develop ties to conservative American politics. In a supporting affidavit to the government's support for pre-trial detention following her indictment in United States of America v. Maria Butina, the FBI stated that she had successfully sought ties to the Republican Party, where it is referred to as ""POLITICAL PARTY 1"". According to The Daily Beast, she has presented herself as a ""Russian central bank staffer, a leading gun rights advocate, a 'representative of the Russian Federation,' a Washington, D.C. graduate student, a journalist, and a connection between Team Trump and Russia"" in order to gain access to ""high-level contacts"" in Washington. At the 2014 NRA annual meeting, Butina took pictures with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former U.S. Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Rick Santorum.


=== Obama administration officials ===
In 2015, Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and Butina met the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations. Separately, they also met with a Federal Reserve vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and with a State Department official.


=== Donald Trump campaign ===
In a June 2015 article published in The National Interest, a conservative American international affairs magazine, just before Trump announced his candidacy for president, she urged better relations between the United States and Russia, saying, ""It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States."" The next month, Butina attended FreedomFest, where Trump gave a speech, and asked him from the audience about ending U.S. sanctions against Russia, to which he replied, ""I don't think you'd need the sanctions."" Butina hosted a birthday party attended by Erickson and Trump campaign aides shortly after the 2016 election.


== Relationships with Trump associates ==
Butina was in a relationship with Overstock.com CEO and Trump conspiracy theorist Patrick M. Byrne. Byrne claimed the FBI encouraged him to pursue Butina, a claim retired FBI officials denied. In 2019, Byrne divested himself of all shares of Overstock after his relationship with Butina was revealed.For five years, prosecutors claimed, Butina lived with and maintained an intimate relationship with activist and fraudster Paul Erickson. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. Erickson was jailed and convicted of fraud unrelated to his relationship with Butina, then pardoned by Trump in his last week in office.


== United States of America v. Mariia Butina, aka Maria Butina ==


=== Complaint ===
On July 15, 2018, Butina was arrested in Washington, and charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government; specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General, a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, 18 U.S.C. §951 (foreign relations, agents of foreign governments), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 (conspiracy).After her arrest, it was mistakenly reported she was charged with a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. §11 foreign agents and propaganda). United States law dictates that all lobbyists representing foreign governments must register as such with the Department of Justice. Her attorney said that ""the allegations of the indictment are essentially that her only illegal act was not registering.""On July 18, Butina pleaded not guilty, and a District Court judge ordered her jailed pending trial. She was also said to be cooperating in a federal fraud investigation in South Dakota. Butina was held in solitary confinement in Alexandria Detention Center.


=== Affidavit ===

According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government, who, according to The New York Times, was believed to be Torshin. The court filings detail the Russian official's and Butina's efforts for Butina to act as an agent of Russia inside the United States by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in the Republican Party and in conservative politics—such as the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast and some religious organizations—for the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation.The filings also describe certain actions taken by Butina to further this effort during multiple visits from Russia and, later, when she entered and resided in the United States on a student visa. The filings allege that she undertook her activities ""without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law.""Butina, Torshin, and Erickson have been subjects of an investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Erickson is referred to in Butina's indictment as ""Person 1."" In addition, George D. O'Neill Jr., a conservative writer and Rockefeller heir, is ""Person 2."" Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the FBI into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency.The FBI began to monitor Butina in August 2016, after she had moved to the United States on an F-1 student visa. Rather than confront her immediately, the FBI chose to track her movements and gather information on whom she was meeting, and what her end goals were to be.


=== Plea deal ===

Butina's attorneys and federal prosecutors declared in a November 16, 2018, court filing that they had entered into plea negotiations. On December 13, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an illegal foreign agent, while the original charge of failing to register as a foreign agent was dropped. She faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison and, according to a CNN report, will ""likely be deported after serving any time.""On April 26, 2019, Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, in accordance with the recommendations of prosecutors. Butina was released from prison on October 25 and deported back to Russia.
Butina later complained that in the U.S., she was forced to sign a plea-deal. She claimed that she was sentenced for simply being Russian.


=== Russian reaction ===
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had no prior knowledge of Butina. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a statement saying that Butina's arrest was designed to undermine the ""positive results"" of the Helsinki summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin. She was arrested a day before Trump met his Russian counterpart. Butina's father has called the accusations against her ""a witch-hunt"".Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, called Butina's case a ""modern political inquisition."" Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of forcing false confession from Butina. According to the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, ""having created unbearable conditions for her and threatening her with a long jail sentence, she was literally forced to sign up to absolutely ridiculous charges.""

4,"Olga Dergunova (born 1965) is the Deputy President of VTB Bank, a bank headquartered in Russia. She was hired to head the IT systems merger for the different subsidiaries of VTB Bank. She started her career in the IT industry before working as President of Microsoft Russia. She transitioned to VTB Bank in 2007, working as a member of the Management Board, before leaving to serve in the Russian Government as Deputy Minister of Economic Development and also as the head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management. She was hired as Deputy President of VTB Bank in 2016. Her main initiatives as Deputy President include preparing the company for digital banking transformations, including artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology, as well as allowing customers access to their finances without visiting a physical branch location. A 2001 Wall Street Journal report listed her among the Top 30 most influential European businesswomen.


== Early life and education ==
Olga Dergunova was born in Moscow in 1965, in what was then the Soviet Union. She studied at and graduated from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, focusing on computer science and economic cybernetics.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
Before joining Microsoft Russia, Olga Dergunova worked as a sales and marketing director at a Russian IT company. She worked at various IT companies between 1992 and 1994.


=== Microsoft Russia (1994-2007) ===
Olga Dergunova was hired at Microsoft's relatively new Russian operation, which had only existed for 18 months. The operation at the time related to the licensing of the company's programs. She joined in part to gain a global perspective on the technology industry. In 1995, Dergunova was promoted to general director of the company's Russian branch, and she became its chair in 2004.At the time that Dergunova entered Microsoft, Russia was slowly being converted from a communist country into a capitalist country, following the fall of the Soviet Union. During this period of time, the two primary concerns of Western IT companies operating in Russia were a lack of demand for their products and the online piracy of their products. Software used to be sold in the country unlicensed, so the idea of licensed software was relatively new to the country. Over the course of her tenure, and in the general Russian market, the piracy of software has declined. However, piracy was still common in the country in the mid-2000s.One of her biggest roles was to explain the concept of intellectual property to Russian consumers, with the goal of decreasing piracy and increasing demand for the company's products. In order to improve the sales of Microsoft products in the country, she lowered the prices of the company's products and hired local residents to sell products to consumers. The programs were also translated into Russian. As a result of local hiring efforts, in 2005 over half of all Russian IT workers worked for Microsoft, according to Microsoft's estimate.With regards to intellectual property enforcement, Dergunova usually focused on larger counterfeit software sellers rather than individuals who download the products for personal usage or for small-scale distribution.


=== VTB Bank (2007-2012) ===
In 2007, Olga Dergunova left Microsoft Russia to join VTB Bank's Management Board. This occurred shortly after VTB Bank's initial public offering in London. Her switch to banking also occurred during the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Her family members, including her husband who works in finance, taught her many terms necessary to operate in a bank. She was hired as a member of the company's Management board. She also worked as the head of the Second Corporate Block, serving the bank's major clients. She worked in this role from 2007 to 2012, before her appointment to the Russian government.


=== State Property Management Agency (2012-2016) ===
In 2012, Olga Dergunova was appointed to head the Federal Agency for State Property Management and to serve as the deputy minister of economic development. The agency is responsible for privatizing formerly state-owned businesses as well as managing government properties. The overall privatization efforts sought to close the Russian governmental's budget shortfall caused by the collapse of oil prices, with efforts peaking in 2016. One of the first businesses that Dergunova oversaw that had the potential to be privatized was Sovcomflot. However, that business had not yet been sold by the time she left her position. Another business touted to be privatized was VTB bank; at that point, the government owned 60.9 of its outstanding shares. However, that deal did not happen as well, partly due to the recovery of oil prices generating more revenue for the Russian government to avoid having to sell equity in its businesses.Overall, the privatization efforts sought to raise capital from Western investors in order to combat budget shortfalls due to both oil prices being depressed at the time as well as sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea. However, the agency led by Dergunova did not want to sell off equity in Russian companies at bargain prices, which would have reduced the government's control of the economy without a large enough return on the sale.On the other end of the spectrum was a decree for state-owned enterprises, such as Gazprom, to raise dividends. Due to the high degree of state ownership, a very large portion of those dividends, if not the majority, would flow to the Russian government and reduce its budget shortfall. Dergunova stated that raising dividends would raise as much as 100 billion rubles ($1.7 Billion) in additional government revenue.The lack of an acceptable sell price for equity as well as improving economic conditions in Russia stalled the efforts to privatize the economy. As of March 2019, the Russian government still owns the same 60.9% share of VTB Bank as it did in the past. The government also still owns 100% of Sovcomflot.In January 2016, rumors of Dergunova's departure from her government position surfaced. A report by Russian media outlet, Kommersant, claimed that Dergunova slowed down privatization attempts. On April 12, 2016, Dergunova was officially released from her position, succeeded by Dmitry Pristanskov.


=== Deputy President at VTB Bank (2016-present) ===
On June 24, 2016, Olga Dergunova rejoined VTB Bank, this time as the Chairman of its Management Board and as its Deputy President. Dergunova was put in charge of positioning VTB Bank's digital strategies. Her core initiatives include making it possible to do banking digitally without ever having to reach a physical branch location. To that end, she first oversaw the integration of all of the bank's IT systems, utilizing her past experience at Microsoft Russia. The 2017 merger of VTB24, the group's retail banking group, was a big test for merging systems into one comprehensive system. The IT merger put 20 million clients onto one IT system. Merging banking operations was critical to allowing 24/7 access to its banking platforms.At the beginning of her tenure, Dergunova sought to implement artificial intelligence into operations at VTB Bank, utilizing it to calculate credit risk. VTB Bank also used AI to automate the opening of accounts for individual components of companies. She also sought to utilize biometrics in its mobile applications and customer service centers in order to better verify a customer's identity and reduce the potential for fraud. In addition, in 2017, VTB Bank, along with other financial services companies, launched a 5-week Fintech Startup incubator to help develop different technologies. Also at the beginning of 2017, Dergunova sought to launch a new mobile application for VTB Bank, to be launched in early 2019.


=== Sanctions ===
Sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War. 


== Personal life ==
Olga Dergunova is married and has one daughter, Nina. She met her husband while they were both studying at university together. She likes to play golf, ski, and go camping.

5,"Natalya Ivanovna Kasperskaya (Russian: Наталья Ивановна Касперская; born 5 February 1966 in Moscow, Soviet Union)—who, in the West, uses as her surname the masculine form Kaspersky—is a Russian IT entrepreneur, President of the InfoWatch Group of companies and co-founder and former CEO of antivirus security software company Kaspersky Lab. In addition, she is one of the wealthiest women in Russia and one of the most influential figures in the Russian IT industry.


== Biography ==


=== Early years ===
Natalya Kasperskaya (maiden name Stutser) was born on 5 February 1966 in Moscow into a family of engineers and Soviet defense research institute employees.Natalya was elected as a member of her school pioneer council, and later as a member of the district pioneer headquarters, and was also a Komsomol member and organizer. Alongside her main education, Natalya also played basketball in the Children's and Youth Sports School and seriously intended to become a veterinarian until giving up on the dream because of difficulties with studying chemistry.In the eighth year of her education, Natalya moved from an ordinary secondary school to a physics-mathematical school run by the Moscow Aviation Institute.


=== Education ===
After finishing this school, Natalya took the entrance exams for the Lomonosov Moscow State University but was not enrolled, missing out by half a point. However, her results were good enough to gain entry into the Moscow Institute of Electronic Machine Building (MIEM), where she studied applied mathematics (1984-1989), and the topic of her diploma was a mathematical model of a nuclear reactor cooling system. Later, she earned a bachelor's degree from the Open University in the UK. During her studies at the MIEM, she met her first husband Eugene Kaspersky, whom she married in 1986.


=== Career ===
After graduating from the institute, Natalya was assigned to the Central Scientific and Construction Bureau in Moscow, where she worked for half a year as a research scientist before going on maternity leave. Natalya started her career in IT at the age of 28, when she took on a job, in January 1994, as a salesperson for a computer accessories and software firm with a 50-dollar monthly salary. The job was based in a newly opened store in the KAMI Information Technologies Center created by a former professor of Natalya's ex-husband, Eugene Kaspersky, from a Higher School of the KGB during the Soviet epoch. She believes that all personal data, such as search history, geolocation, contacts, correspondence, photo and video materials, should belong to the State.


==== Kaspersky Lab ====
In September 1994, Natalya became head of a distribution department of AntiViral Toolkit Pro (AVP), which had been under development by Eugene Kaspersky's team since 1991. Over two or three years, Natalya successfully built distribution channels and a technical support network and entered international markets, with sales growing rapidly from an initial $100–200 per month in 1994, to more than $130,000 after a year, over $600,000 in 1996 and more than $1 million in 1997. Revenue was divided between the team and the mother company until 1997, when the future founders of 'Kaspersky Lab' decided to start their own business.Natalya launched the Kaspersky Lab foundation in June 1997, was key to the naming of the new company, and worked as CEO for more than 10 years. Shares in 'Kaspersky Lab' were initially split between Eugene Kaspersky (50%), his two teammate programmers Alexey De-Monderik and Vadim Bogdanov (20% each), and Natalya Kasperskaya (10%). In 1997, Kaspersky Lab sales started to double yearly, with turnover reaching around $7 million in 2001 and exceeding $67 million in 2006.In August 2007, Natalya was unseated and suspended from her key management functions by Eugene Kaspersky due to the couple's divorce and the deepening ideological divide between the two. Eventually, Natalya agreed to stay on as Chairperson of the newly established board of 'Kaspersky Lab', before finally breaking all ties with the previously family driven business in 2011, with Kaspersky Lab buying out Natalya's stake in the company in 2007 and 2011 (around 30% of shares in 2007).Under Natalya's supervision, Kaspersky Lab turned into a leading antivirus corporation with a network of regional offices worldwide. At the moment of the power change in 2007, annual sales revenue had reached $126 million, while the company had an estimated capitalization of over $1.3 billion and yearly revenue of $700 million by 2011, when Natalya sold her remaining stake and departed. After the change in management, the company's rate of growth dropped visibly, with global revenue growing by 40% in 2009, 13.7% in 2011, 3% in 2012, and 6% in 2013.


==== InfoWatch ====
After 'Kaspersky Lab' had bought the antispam technology developed by 'Ashmanov and Partners', the head of the latter, Igor Ashmanov, gave the buyer an idea to use the antispam engine backwards for protection against data leaks. During 2001–2002, 'Kaspersky Lab' programmers developed a solution which later became known as InfoWatch Traffic Monitor Enterprise and which offers protection for corporate users against internal threats (a DLP system). In December 2013, a subsidiary called 'InfoWatch' was established to develop and distribute new software.Natalya Kasperskaya has been CEO and majority owner of 'InfoWatch' since October 2007, with her stake in the company being linked to the business separation deal with her ex-husband. Natalya made her main investments in 'InfoWatch', 'Kribrum' and 'Nanosemantics' co-owned by her and Igor Ashmanov, and 'G Data Software' AG, a German antivirus company.'InfoWatch' software had only vague prospects at the time of the spin-off and was an albatross around 'Kaspersky Lab's neck. Unlike 'Kaspersky Lab', the technological solutions and product line of the new company were initially targeted at large and medium enterprises, starting from 300 workstations, rather than small businesses and retailers.This required a fundamentally different skill set and approach, with Natalya's previous experience in management turning out not to be particularly relevant. Nevertheless, in 2012 InfoWatch, which was previously unprofitable, recorded its first earnings and went on growing at an annual rate of 60—70%. According to 'Forbes', InfoWatch annual revenue reached around $12 million in 2015, with independent experts polled by Russian daily newspaper 'Kommersant' in spring 2015 estimating the business to be worth $40–50 million.Today, InfoWatch is a group of companies working in two main business areas — corporate protection against internal threats and external targeted attacks — with the company holding almost a 50% share of the Russian confidential data protection market (DLP systems). Among longstanding clients are Russian governmental organizations, as well as 'Sberbank', 'Beeline', 'Lukoil', 'Tatneft', 'Surgutneftegas', 'Sukhoi', 'Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works', etc. In addition, InfoWatch is actively developing the German, Middle East, and South-East Asian markets.Current InfoWatch shareholders are Natalya Kasperskaya and the company's Deputy CEO Rustem Khairetdinov.


== Achievements ==


=== Private fortune ===
According to Forbes, Natalya Kasperskaya had a fortune of around $220 million in March 2013 – an estimate which increased to $230 million in 2014 and $270 million in 2015. In March 2015, Russian news portal 'Lenta.ru' agreed with Forbes’ 2014 estimation while, in July 2015, German magazine 'Der Spiegel' published an estimation of €207 million. Finally, in August of the same year, women's magazine 'Cosmopolitan' published an estimate of $270 million.According to 'Der Spiegel', the majority of Natalya Kasperskaya's fortune is in the form of funds derived from asset sales. As for Kaspersky herself, in October 2015, in response to the question as to whether the 'Forbes' calculations are accurate, she emphasized that her company is non-public and thus has no need to reveal its level of capitalization, while adding that “it is nevertheless good to see that people seem to appreciate the value of 'InfoWatch'”.

Furthermore, she also had a passion for the guitar and poetry and often sang and played guitar at parties.Natalya's interest in trekking, skiing, travelling with friends and children, and reading professional literature came later and she considers Good to Great and Built to Last written by American business consultant Jim Collins to be her favorite books, saying that they have influenced her outlook.

The couple split up in 1997 and divorced in 1998, at Eugene's instigation. However, due to their joint and rapidly growing business, the divorce had to be covered up for a couple of years in order to not demotivate employees and panic the market.Natalya met her second husband, Igor Ashmanov, in 1996 at the CeBIT computer expo in Hannover, where they were working at neighboring stands. A year later, Natalya and Igor renewed their acquaintance and started communicating with one another regularly on a professional basis.

Natalya's sons from her first marriage both studied at Lomonosov Moscow State University, with Maxim graduating from the faculty of Geography and Ivan from the faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics.In April 2011, Natalya's 20-year-old son Ivan was kidnapped in the Strogino district of Moscow on his way to work, with the perpetrators holding him in one of the villages in the Sergievo-Posadsky subregion of Moscow oblast (suburb) and demanding a ransom of €3 million from his parents. However, five days later Ivan was freed thanks to the actions of the Russian intelligence services, with the five kidnappers, including two repeat offenders, being sentenced to prison terms ranging from 4.5 to 11 years.

10,"Anna Loginova (Russian: Анна Логинова; 3 September 1978 – 27 January 2008) was a Russian fashion model and later a trained bodyguard. She ran an agency, staffed with female bodyguards, some trained by the ex-KGB, to give discreet protection to Moscow's billionaires and their wives and mistresses. She was killed in a carjacking incident in Moscow. Loginova was described as Russia's most famous female bodyguard.

Loginova was previously a model, working in advertising campaigns for Chanel and BMW. She also appeared almost naked in the December issue of the Russian version of Maxim.She learned martial arts techniques and started a security firm, Stilet (literally dagger), specializing in female bodyguards in 2005. The use of female bodyguards includes escorting the protected person to a restaurant where male bodyguards would be more noticeable and are generally required to wait outside.


== Death ==
Loginova died from head injuries sustained while clinging  to the door handle of her Porsche Cayenne while being dragged along the street at high speed as a carjacker drove the car away. She reportedly was pushed out of the vehicle and, for a moment, held  on to the door handle before receiving her fatal head injuries. Police reported she died at the scene. She was 29 years old. The stolen vehicle was later abandoned in southwest Moscow. The carjacker has not been found. She left one child behind. She was buried in the Ulybyshevo cemetery in Vladimir.

15,"Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Alexeyeva (Russian: Людми́ла Миха́йловна Алексе́ева, IPA: [lʲʊˈdmʲilə ɐlʲɪˈksʲeɪvə]; 20 July 1927 – 8 December 2018) was a Russian historian and human-rights activist who was a founding member in 1976 of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group and one of the last Soviet dissidents active in post-Soviet Russia.


== Biography ==


=== Soviet period ===
In April 1968, Alexeyeva was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from her job at the publishing house. Nonetheless, she continued her activities in defense of human rights. From 1968 to 1972 she worked clandestinely as a typist for the first underground bulletin The Chronicle of Current Events devoted to human rights violations in the USSR.In February 1977, Alexeyeva fled from the USSR to the United States following a crackdown against members of The Chronicle by Soviet authorities.  In the US Alexeyeva continued to advocate for human rights improvements in Russia and worked on a freelance basis for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America. She became a US citizen in 1982. She wrote regularly on the Soviet dissident movement for both English and Russian language publications in the US and elsewhere, and in 1985 she published the first comprehensive monograph on the history of the movement, Soviet Dissent (Wesleyan University Press). In addition, after moving to the United States, Alexeyeva took up freelance radio journalism for Radio Liberty and the Russian language section of the Voice of America. In 1990 she published The Thaw Generation, an autobiography that described the formation of the Soviet dissident movement and was co-written with Paul Goldberg.


=== Return to Russia ===
In 1989 she restarted the Moscow Helsinki Group following its dissolution in 1982. In 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she returned to Russia, and she became a chairperson of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1996.  In 2000, Alexeyeva joined a commission set up to advise President Vladimir Putin on human rights issues, a move that triggered criticism from some other rights activists.Alexeyeva was critical of the Kremlin's human rights record and accused the government of numerous human rights violations including the regular prohibitions of non-violent meetings and demonstrations and encouragement of extremists with its nationalistic policies, such as the mass deportations of Georgians in 2006 and police raids against foreigners working in street markets. She has also criticized the law enforcers' conduct in Ingushetia and has warned that growing violence in the republic may spread to the whole Russian Federation. In 2006, she was accused by the Russian authorities of involvement with British intelligence and received threats from nationalist groups.


=== Strategy-31 ===
From August 31, 2009, Alexeyeva was an active participant in Strategy-31 – the regular protest rallies of citizens on Moscow's Triumfalnaya Square in defense of the 31st Article (On the Freedom of Assembly) of the Russian Constitution. On December 31, 2009, during one of these attempted protests, Alexeyeva was detained by the riot police (OMON) and taken with scores of others to a police station. This event provoked strong reaction in Russia and abroad. Jerzy Buzek, the President of the European Parliament, was ""deeply disappointed and shocked"" at the treatment of Alexeyeva and others by the police. The National Security Council of the United States expressed ""dismay"" at the detentions. The New York Times published a front-page article about the protest rally (""Tested by Many Foes, Passion of a Russian Dissident Endures"").On March 30, 2010, Alexeyeva was assaulted in the Park Kultury metro station by a man as she was paying respect to the victims of the 2010 Moscow Metro Bombings. At the Lake Seliger youth camp, the Nashi youth movement branded her ""a Nazi"" and an enemy of the Russian people.Alexeyeva was opposed to the 2014 Russian annexation of her native Crimea, saying ""that the seizure of Crimea has shamed my country."" On her 90th birthday she was visited at her home by Russian president Vladimir Putin (accompanied by a cameraman), despite her longstanding criticism of him.She died in a Moscow hospital on 8 December 2018. No cause was given.   Alexeyeva's last words for publication were written to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, although she actually died two days short of that anniversary.   She lamented the weakening of civil society through state propaganda and manipulation, and she drew attention to the weakness of legal culture and of democratic institutions in contemporary Russia, as well as political cynicism and populism which - not just in Russia - treat carelessly the systems and institutions necessary to support human values.

2004 — Olof Palme Prize
2005 — Person of the Year Prize of the Federation of the Jewish Communities of Russia

17,"Nina Alexandrovna Andreyeva (Russian: Нина Александровна Андреева, 12 October 1938 – 24 July 2020) was a Soviet and Russian chemist, teacher, author, political activist, and social critic. A supporter of classical Soviet principles, she wrote an essay entitled I Cannot Forsake My Principles  that defended many aspects of the traditional Soviet system, and criticized General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and his closest supporters for not being true communists. In the rebuke published in the official party newspaper Pravda the essay was called The Manifesto of Anti-Perestroika Forces.


== Career in chemistry ==
She was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), and was a chemistry lecturer at the Leningrad Technological Institute. She joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) around 1966.


== I Cannot Forsake My Principles ==
Andreyeva's essay I Cannot Forsake My Principles (Не могу поступаться принципами; variously translated in English commentary) was published in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya on March 13, 1988, at a time when Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev were either about to start on overseas visit or already abroad, and was initiated and approved by the secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee, Yegor Ligachev. She was contemptuous of Perestroika and defended the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Of the Great Purges, ""they are being blown out of proportion"" she wrote.Giulietto Chiesa, then Moscow correspondent of the Italian Communist newspaper L'Unità, found Andreyeva's original letter and discovered that it had been rewritten, only 5 pages of her 18 page typescript were published, much of the rest being thought too extreme. In the originally unpublished portions, Andreyeva commented that Stalin's critics wrote ""in the language of Goebbels"" and referred to ""nations of little importance, like the Crimean Tartars and Zionist Jews.""Party officials critical of the reforms welcomed the published essay. Ligachev told the official news agency TASS to send the Andreyeva letter to local newspapers throughout the Soviet Union to publish it. It was much reprinted in the Soviet Union and East Germany, but it received no critical response in the media. The Leningrad party issued a television documentary apparently showing mass support in the city for the Andreyeva letter.Not until after Gorbachev had returned from abroad, and following a two-day meeting of the politburo on March 24–25 to discuss the Andreyeva letter, did a response appear in Pravda on 5 April 1988. The Pravda article described the letter as containing ""nostalgia, backward-looking patriotism,"" the work of ""blind, die-hard, undoubting dogmatists."" Gorbachev said later that many members of the Politburo seemed to share Andreyeva's views, and that he had to coerce them into approving the publication of an official rejoinder. Gorbachev described it as a direct attack ""against perestroika.""Under the reforms, she told David Remnick of The Washington Post in 1989 that under Stalin ""the country built socialism for 30 years"" and stated: ""Our media are lying about Stalin now. They are blackening our history."" On then current conditions, she told him: ""The political structure of an anti-socialist movement is taking place in the form of democratic unions and popular fronts."" She said of Leningrad television: ""they'll show an artist, a painter, who is supposedly a representative of Russian art. But excuse me, he is not a Russian. He is a Jew."" She added: ""You can say Russian, Ukrainian, why not Jew? Does it diminish the person? Why hide him behind some other nationality. Jew and Zionist mean different things, but all Zionists are Jews."" In the Sovetskaya Rossiya letter, she attacked ""cosmopolitan"" conspirators.For his book Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire (1993), Remnick drew on his contact with Andreyeva.

19,"Maria Ivanovna Arbatova (Russian: Мари́я Ива́новна Арба́това, born 17 July 1957), is a Russian novelist, short story writer, playwright, poet, journalist, talkshow host, politician, and one of Russia's most widely known feminists in the 1990s. When growing up, she was already showing strong controversial ideologies, for instance, she refused to join the Young Communist League, for she preferred to be ""a hippy"". She studied at the Faculty of Philosophy at Moscow State University, in the Dramatic Arts division of the Gorky Literary Institute, and underwent training in psychoanalysis. She had to leave state university of Moscow ""due to ideological conflicts."" When she was 19, she became a mother of twins, which complicated her educational processes. She continued studying at the Maxim Gorky Literature institute. After finishing her studies, Maria published some prose and poetry works, however she returned to writing drama, as she claims it is more natural expression for her than other genres. In the pre-perestroika years, the years before 1985, her literary works were banned by censorship. Before glasnost and perestroika, the political program of restructuring and openness of Michail Gorbatsjov, Arbatova had just one play staged, a play that was commissioned. An example of a play that was censored is the play called ""Equitation with two knowns"". It was banned by the ministry of culture for 10 years. The play is about a female gynecologist performing abortions. The play was misinterpreted as a statement of good or bad of abortion. However the purpose of the play is to bring up the unfair share of responsibility for birth control and child-raising. Nowadays Arbatova is a member of the Moscow Writer's Union and the Union of Theatrical Workers of Russia. She is the author of fourteen plays staged in Russia and abroad, twenty books, and numerous articles in newspapers and periodicals. She has received multiple accolades for her literary and public achievements.


== Early life ==
Maria Arbatova (originally Gavrilina) was born in 1957 in Murom. Her parents gave her complete freedom and the run of her grandfather's apartment in the Arbat. This apartment had once belonged to the famous singer Fyodor Chaliapin and provided Maria with her pen name of Arbatova, which she took as her legal last name in 1999. Known as a non-conformist since her youth, she refused to join the Komsomol because it stood in contradiction to her principles.She studied in the School of Young Journalists at Moscow State University, later transferring to the Faculty of Philosophy. She left the University due to ideological issues.  She then studied in the Dramatic Arts division of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute, and underwent training in psychoanalysis. She was also a hippie activist. In the pre-perestroika years, her literary works were banned by the censorship. Today she is a member of the Moscow Writer's Union and the Union of Theatrical Workers of Russia.


=== Arbatova as a feminist ===
Arbatova is seen as one of Russia's first feminists. She was the first feminist with a national, later even international, audience. An interview she is internationally known for, is the article in which she suggests Russia starts importing Indian men, for they are much more suitable as husbands.[3]Russian men have always been outnumbered, Arbatova suggests marrying Indian men, for they match emotionally. One could see this statement as anti-feminist, but Arbatova disagrees. In her opinion, being a feminist does not necessarily mean that one has to hate the opposite sex.


=== Feminist ideas in her work ===
In general, Arbatova in her feminist ideas advocate against the traditional male-female relationship in Soviet society. Women do not value their creative potential and consider marriage as a highest possible social achievement. In her own autobiography Mne sorok let (I am Forty, 1997) María makes an example of her mother, who she believes was the starting point for María to become a feminist. Women cannot fulfill their lives only through their role as a wife\mother. This lack of emancipation is partly a fault of Soviet society in which the status of women was often totally dependent on husbands, despite Soviet preach for the male-female equality.
Her prose text My Last Letter to A illustrates the modern era of liberation and rebellion of women against the traditional relationship of women being dependent on men. This work is a collection of short insights of María's thoughts and personal experiences from her private and public life. All of them criticize phallocracy. She openly addresses  ""this hopeless male world"" [5] , which denies the same rights for women.
In My Name is Women published in 1997, Maria addresses the issue of the conditions in maternity hospitals. She discusses in an angry tone her experience of giving a birth and concludes with words : ""All this happened to me seventeen years ago for the sole reason that I am a woman. And as long as there are people who do not regard this as a suitable subject for discussion it will happen each day to other women, because being a woman in this world is not something worthy of respect, even when you are doing the only thing that men cannot do.""


== Career ==
She is the author of 14 plays staged in Russia and abroad, 20 books, and numerous articles in newspapers and periodicals. Her books and plays, coming from one of the first Russian woman writers with an openly feminist ideology, won the hearts of a wide audience. She co-hosted the popular television show I, Myself (Ya Sama), a program that ran for almost ten years. It was chiefly due to her efforts that the words ""feminism"" and ""feminist"" acquired legitimacy in the post-Soviet era. Since 2005, she has conducted a human rights related program The Right to be Yourself on Radio Mayak.Beginning in 1991, along with to her literary and media activities, she spearheaded the activities of Harmony, a feministic club for the psychological rehabilitation of women. She has also provided individual counselling since 1996. From 1996 onwards, her Club of Women Interfering in Politics has sought a more equal representation of women in Russian politics.She joined the ranks of the liberal Soyuz Pravikh Sil (Union of Right Forces), and made an unsuccessful bid in 1999 for election to the State Duma from the University district of Moscow and, subsequently, wrote an account of her experience in the novel How I Fairly Tried to Get Into the Duma. In 2000, she conducted the political campaign of Ella Pamfilova, the first woman to run for the Presidency of Russia. Arbatova applied for the post of the Human Rights Plenipotentiary of Russia and, from 2001 to 2003, was the leader of the Human Rights Party. In 2005, she was among the leaders of the political block Free Russia during the Moscow municipal elections.Despite her hippie years and literary background, Arbatova lived much the same life and shared the same problems as most Soviet women. Her first marriage to singer Alexander Miroshnik broke up, and she had to bring up 2 twin sons (Peter and Pavel, born in 1977) by herself. Her second marriage to Oleg Vitte didn't survive Arbatova's political activity and the State Duma elections she took part in. She is currently married to Shumit Datta Gupta, a financial analyst.
Maria Arbatova's activities, through her books, her numerous appearances and statements in the press and her social work, have brought to the forefront the theme of discrimination against Russian women. She has always refused grants for her activities, rejecting monetary gains for her ""missionary"" work.

Avksentyeva previously headed Zabolev's election headquarters. Since 2012 she was director of the production and commercial complex ""Aerotorgservice"" of Yakutsk Airport.


== 2018 Mayoral election ==
In September 2018, she was elected the mayor of Yakutsk from the minor ""Party of Russia's Rebirth"", while remaining non-partisan. She won with 39.98%, ahead of Alexander Savvinov of the United Russia party, who received 31.70% of the vote.Sardana Avksentyeva became the first woman to assume the post of mayor of Yakutsk. In an interview for Meduza, Avksentyeva stated that she decided to try her hand at the suggestion of the Rodina nominee Vladimir Fyodorov, who was forced to withdraw his candidacy. The main sponsor of Avksentyeva's campaign was the Utum group of companies and its founder Vasily Gogolev, who had previously supported Fydorov.


== Mayoralty ==
In the first year of her tenure, in order to save budgetary funds, Avksentyeva put up the official cars of administration employees for auction, cut the costs of holidays and other events, external and public relations, the reception of delegations. Subsequently, the mayor's office was unable to sell its off-road vehicles. Instead of a portrait of Vladimir Putin, common for Russian local authorities' offices, Avksentyeva placed a photograph of people celebrating the Yakut summer holiday Yhyakh in her office.In March 2020, the incident with the mass killing of animals with rabies at the animal transfer station in Yakutsk sparked outrage among animal rights activists. Avksentyeva proposed to the deputies of the Yakutsk City Duma to introduce a tax on pet owners and to use the collected funds for the capture and sterilization of stray animals.

Avksentieva's personal rating fell: at the end of the year, only 23% of the poll participants agree to name her the most competent female politician in the region, while 70% said this two years earlier. In January 2021, Avksentyeva announced  her early resignation for health reasons


=== Opinions ===
The Economist noted in an article entitled “The sudden popularity of a Russian mayor who lives modestly” her leadership style, which is atypical for Russia, and her popularity both in Yakutia and Russiawide.
Avksentyeva's predecessor as mayor and incumbent Head of Yakutia Aysen Nikolayev noted that she has led the election headquarters of United Russia in Yakutsk for a long time, and therefore he believes that she is not an oppositionist. Nikolayev also described Avksentyeva as ""an adequate person with whom it is comfortable to work.""
In September 2020, the ex-employee of the mayor's office Svetlana Altabasova accused Avksentyeva of a fraud with the sale of premises as part of the housing distribution program for the state employees in 2011. Initially, charges of fraud were brought against Altabasova herself, but she said that she was “the victim of a cunning scheme” created by Avksentyeva. According to Altabasova, the mayor and employees of the administration received apartments when Avksentyeva and her husband both were deputy mayors of Yakutsk.


== Member of parliament ==
After Avksentyeva's resignation the media have repeatedly expressed the point of view that administrative pressure was exerted on her to prevent her nomination for the upcoming elections to the 8th State Duma.On 4 July 2021 at the 3rd congress of the New People, party leader Alexey Nechayev announced that Sardana Avksentyeva would be placed second after him in the federal party list for the lower house.

32,"Olga Dergunova (born 1965) is the Deputy President of VTB Bank, a bank headquartered in Russia. She was hired to head the IT systems merger for the different subsidiaries of VTB Bank. She started her career in the IT industry before working as President of Microsoft Russia. She transitioned to VTB Bank in 2007, working as a member of the Management Board, before leaving to serve in the Russian Government as Deputy Minister of Economic Development and also as the head of the Federal Agency for State Property Management. She was hired as Deputy President of VTB Bank in 2016. Her main initiatives as Deputy President include preparing the company for digital banking transformations, including artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology, as well as allowing customers access to their finances without visiting a physical branch location. A 2001 Wall Street Journal report listed her among the Top 30 most influential European businesswomen.


== Early life and education ==
Olga Dergunova was born in Moscow in 1965, in what was then the Soviet Union. She studied at and graduated from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, focusing on computer science and economic cybernetics.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
Before joining Microsoft Russia, Olga Dergunova worked as a sales and marketing director at a Russian IT company. She worked at various IT companies between 1992 and 1994.


=== Microsoft Russia (1994-2007) ===
Olga Dergunova was hired at Microsoft's relatively new Russian operation, which had only existed for 18 months. The operation at the time related to the licensing of the company's programs. She joined in part to gain a global perspective on the technology industry. In 1995, Dergunova was promoted to general director of the company's Russian branch, and she became its chair in 2004.At the time that Dergunova entered Microsoft, Russia was slowly being converted from a communist country into a capitalist country, following the fall of the Soviet Union. During this period of time, the two primary concerns of Western IT companies operating in Russia were a lack of demand for their products and the online piracy of their products. Software used to be sold in the country unlicensed, so the idea of licensed software was relatively new to the country. Over the course of her tenure, and in the general Russian market, the piracy of software has declined. However, piracy was still common in the country in the mid-2000s.One of her biggest roles was to explain the concept of intellectual property to Russian consumers, with the goal of decreasing piracy and increasing demand for the company's products. In order to improve the sales of Microsoft products in the country, she lowered the prices of the company's products and hired local residents to sell products to consumers. The programs were also translated into Russian. As a result of local hiring efforts, in 2005 over half of all Russian IT workers worked for Microsoft, according to Microsoft's estimate.With regards to intellectual property enforcement, Dergunova usually focused on larger counterfeit software sellers rather than individuals who download the products for personal usage or for small-scale distribution.


=== VTB Bank (2007-2012) ===
In 2007, Olga Dergunova left Microsoft Russia to join VTB Bank's Management Board. This occurred shortly after VTB Bank's initial public offering in London. Her switch to banking also occurred during the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Her family members, including her husband who works in finance, taught her many terms necessary to operate in a bank. She was hired as a member of the company's Management board. She also worked as the head of the Second Corporate Block, serving the bank's major clients. She worked in this role from 2007 to 2012, before her appointment to the Russian government.


=== State Property Management Agency (2012-2016) ===
In 2012, Olga Dergunova was appointed to head the Federal Agency for State Property Management and to serve as the deputy minister of economic development. The agency is responsible for privatizing formerly state-owned businesses as well as managing government properties. The overall privatization efforts sought to close the Russian governmental's budget shortfall caused by the collapse of oil prices, with efforts peaking in 2016. One of the first businesses that Dergunova oversaw that had the potential to be privatized was Sovcomflot. However, that business had not yet been sold by the time she left her position. Another business touted to be privatized was VTB bank; at that point, the government owned 60.9 of its outstanding shares. However, that deal did not happen as well, partly due to the recovery of oil prices generating more revenue for the Russian government to avoid having to sell equity in its businesses.Overall, the privatization efforts sought to raise capital from Western investors in order to combat budget shortfalls due to both oil prices being depressed at the time as well as sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea. However, the agency led by Dergunova did not want to sell off equity in Russian companies at bargain prices, which would have reduced the government's control of the economy without a large enough return on the sale.On the other end of the spectrum was a decree for state-owned enterprises, such as Gazprom, to raise dividends. Due to the high degree of state ownership, a very large portion of those dividends, if not the majority, would flow to the Russian government and reduce its budget shortfall. Dergunova stated that raising dividends would raise as much as 100 billion rubles ($1.7 Billion) in additional government revenue.The lack of an acceptable sell price for equity as well as improving economic conditions in Russia stalled the efforts to privatize the economy. As of March 2019, the Russian government still owns the same 60.9% share of VTB Bank as it did in the past. The government also still owns 100% of Sovcomflot.In January 2016, rumors of Dergunova's departure from her government position surfaced. A report by Russian media outlet, Kommersant, claimed that Dergunova slowed down privatization attempts. On April 12, 2016, Dergunova was officially released from her position, succeeded by Dmitry Pristanskov.


=== Deputy President at VTB Bank (2016-present) ===
On June 24, 2016, Olga Dergunova rejoined VTB Bank, this time as the Chairman of its Management Board and as its Deputy President. Dergunova was put in charge of positioning VTB Bank's digital strategies. Her core initiatives include making it possible to do banking digitally without ever having to reach a physical branch location. To that end, she first oversaw the integration of all of the bank's IT systems, utilizing her past experience at Microsoft Russia. The 2017 merger of VTB24, the group's retail banking group, was a big test for merging systems into one comprehensive system. The IT merger put 20 million clients onto one IT system. Merging banking operations was critical to allowing 24/7 access to its banking platforms.At the beginning of her tenure, Dergunova sought to implement artificial intelligence into operations at VTB Bank, utilizing it to calculate credit risk. VTB Bank also used AI to automate the opening of accounts for individual components of companies. She also sought to utilize biometrics in its mobile applications and customer service centers in order to better verify a customer's identity and reduce the potential for fraud. In addition, in 2017, VTB Bank, along with other financial services companies, launched a 5-week Fintech Startup incubator to help develop different technologies. Also at the beginning of 2017, Dergunova sought to launch a new mobile application for VTB Bank, to be launched in early 2019.


=== Sanctions ===
Sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War. 


== Personal life ==
Olga Dergunova is married and has one daughter, Nina. She met her husband while they were both studying at university together. She likes to play golf, ski, and go camping.

36,"Yekaterina Sergeyevna Duntsova (Russian: Екатерина Сергеевна Дунцова; born 24 April 1983) is a Russian politician and journalist. She began her career as a journalist and was a member of the city duma of Rzhev from 2019 to 2022. 
On 6 November 2023, Duntsova announced her intention to run for the presidency of Russia in the 2024 election; she said she would run as an independent candidate on an anti-war platform. The next month, her nomination documents were rejected by the Central Election Commission.


== Early life ==
Duntsova was born in Krasnoyarsk. In 1995, she had moved to Rzhev, Tver Oblast, where she graduated from high school.


== Journalism career ==
Duntsova began her career in 2003, when she worked for a year at the Rzhev municipal television company, then for several years she was the head of a school television studio. 
She also ran independent television company RiT, a project she and her husband started. Her television company covered problems on the municipal level, namely housing and communal services, lawlessness of officials and crime.


== Political career ==


=== As a local politician ===
In 2009, Duntsova gathered more than 4,000 signatures against the abolition of elections of the mayor of Rzhev.From 2019 to 2022, she was a member of the Rzhev City Duma.


=== Presidential campaign ===

In November 2023, Duntsova announced her intention to run for President of Russia as an independent candidate, using the slogan ""Вернём стране будущее!"" (""We'll bring back the country's future!""). On the same day, she announced the collection of signatures, needing 500 for the first step in the process.
Duntsova explained her intention to run for president by saying that ""Russia has been moving in the wrong direction for the last ten years: the course is not aimed at development, but at self-destruction."" Duntsova's platform stood for ending the war with Ukraine, initiating democratic reforms, releasing political prisoners including Alexei Navalny, restoring relations with other countries, changing budget priorities, and supporting minorities, including LGBT people.On 20 November 2023, Duntsova was summoned to the prosecutor's office. Amongst other topics, they reportedly demanded that she explain her position on the Russo-Ukrainian war. Duntsova later told the media that she refused to answers the officials' questions relating to the war, other than to say that she is in compliance with all relevant laws.Having collected the necessary 500 signatures to form a support group, on 17 December 2023, the group held an official meeting to nominate her. During the meeting, the electricity was turned off and police entered the building, although it was eventually turned back on and there were no further incidents. Duntsova was therefore nominated as planned, and now needed a total of 300,000 signatures by January 31, 2024, to be placed on the ballot. On December 20, Duntsova submitted her application to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to be included on the ballot.On 23 December 2023, the Central Election Commission (CEC) blocked her from running on the ballot after rejecting her nomination documents; the CEC said that it found more than 100 misprints in her documents. In particular, the CEC published scans of documents submitted by Duntsova, which show typos in the names of members of the initiatory group and informal comments in the text of the documents. Also, some members of the initiative group signed with the word ""yes"", ""apple"" or used a drawing of a cat as a signature. In addition, the minutes of the meeting of the initiative group did not reflect information about the election and composition of the counting group.This decision was promptly criticized as politically motivated. Leonid Gozman pointed out, that the ""cowardly"" taken decision had not been based on fears of her being elected, but for the sudden possibility for citizens, to restore ""a forgotten sense of citizenship"" by collecting the necessary signatures.Duntsova said that she planned to appeal the decision in court, although she did not dismiss claims that there had been errors in the filed paperwork, saying the application had been put together on short notice and she had difficulty finding a lawyer to assist her in certifying the paperwork. She also said that she intended to ask the Yabloko party to nominate her as a candidate. 
Later that day, Yabloko party leader Grigory Yavlinsky said in an interview that he was unsure if the party would consider Duntsova's nomination.On 27 December, Russia’s Supreme Court rejected Duntsova’s appeal.


== Personal life ==
Duntsova has three children. A November 2023 article in ЭХО (Echo) described her as separated from her former husband as of two years previously.She coordinates the work of a volunteer search and rescue team in Rzhev.
