Legal initiatives to which Olga Bielkova is an initiator or a principal contributor, that became laws:Draft Law of Ukraine “On natural gas market”, which is a framework law for the sector that establishes qualitatively new rules to gas market. The aim is to create a transparent, competitive and effective gas market in line with the principles of the Third Energy Package: choice of the natural gas supplier and market pricing. One considerable achievement is the functional separation of transportation segments from gas extraction and sales, which increases competitiveness and introduces the clear rules for all market players.

Draft Law of Ukraine ""On transparency of mining industry”: allows to fulfill the requirements of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - namely, to disclose the funds paid by the companies in the field of extraction and transportation of oil and gas to the budgets of different levels, and also the income received by the state from the activities of these companies as well as information on their activity and the license holders.
Draft Law of Ukraine “On amending the legislation of Ukraine on taxation of hydrocarbons production"": provided taxation policy aimed on enhancing natural gas production by increasing volumes of gas produced domestically. This bill introduced specific fiscal rates for new wells (12% or 6% of rental payments depending on the depth of well) to promote an investment.
Draft Law of Ukraine “On reallocation of royalties from O&G to local communities"": assigning 5% of royalties from oil&gas industry(approx. USD 2 billion per year) as an additional income of municipal budgets of the territories, where extraction takes place.
Draft Law of Ukraine “On deregulation in O&G industry"": simplifies the land legislation and improves regulatory regime for oil & gas industry in order to eliminate the outdated and bureaucratic regulatory system (2–3 years to get all necessary permissions) and boost development of new wells.
Draft Law of Ukraine “On the National Energy Regulatory Commission of Ukraine"": reinforces and unifies the regulation of all natural monopolies in one regulator that controls pricing of services, ensuring a balance of interests between producers, consumers, and state. It should guarantee reliable supply to consumers at fair prices, while making sure that the natural monopolies can make sufficient profits to be able to develop.
