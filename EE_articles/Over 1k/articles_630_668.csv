3,"Anastasia Kostyantynivna Prikhodko (Ukrainian: Анастасія Костянтинівна Приходько, romanized: Anastasiya Kostyantynivna Prykhodko; born 21 April 1987) is a Ukrainian activist, politician and former singer-songwriter. Known for her deep contralto singing voice and blend of folk rock and pop music, Prikhodko announced that she would be ending her music career in order to enter politics in October 2018. Prikhodko had previously made herself a major figure during Euromaidan and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, expressing support for Ukrainian forces and vowing to never perform in Russia again.
Prikhodko first received mainstream attention in 2007, after winning series seven of the Russian music competition Fabrika Zvyozd. Her win led her to collaborate with Ukrainian-Russian producer Konstantin Meladze. In 2009, Prikhodko represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, with the song ""Mamo"", written by Meladze. Her participation in the competition came with a number of controversies following her disqualification from the Ukrainian national final and subsequent queries regarding the integrity of the judges and validity of the competition; afterwards, she took part in the Russian national final and won. Prikhodko went on to place 11th in the Eurovision final.
After ending her collaboration with Meladze in 2010, Prikhodko has attempted to represent Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest on two more occasions: 2011 and 2016; she was a finalist in the former year, but was eliminated in the semi-finals in the latter year. Beginning in 2014, Prikhodko became politically active as an activist for pro-Ukrainian forces and pro-Europeanism in Ukraine. In 2015, Prikhodko announced that she would no longer perform in the Russian language. After confirming her departure from the music industry in 2018, Prikhodko announced that she had registered with the All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland"" political party of Yulia Tymoshenko to enter politics.
Prikhodko unsuccessfully took part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election in Ukraine's 11th electoral district on behalf of the Fatherland party.


== Early life and education ==
Prikhodko was born on 21 April 1987 in Kyiv to parents Konstantin Rybalov and Oksana Prikhodko. Her father, a Russian, is originally from Rostov-on-Don and worked as a miner, while her Ukrainian mother works as a theatre critic for the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine. Her parents have since separated, and Prikhodko was raised by her mother; her father returned to Russia after their separation. Prikhodko has an elder brother, Nazar, whom she has collaborated with in music. Prikhodko is additionally of partial Japanese ancestry, having a Japanese great-grandfather.When she was 15, Prikhodko auditioned to join the Ukrainian girl group VIA Gra, but was rejected. Prikhodko attended R. Glier Kyiv Institute of Music and Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts, studying folk vocals.


== Music career ==


=== 2005–2007: Breakthrough and Fabrika Zvyozd ===
After beginning her music career in 2005, Prikhodko first experienced mainstream success in 2007, after being cast in series seven of the Russian music competition Fabrika Zvyozd, an international version of the Spanish program Operación Triunfo. Prikhodko continued to advance through the competition until the finale, where she was declared the winner. Prikhodko garnered controversy during her participation in the show, after she was caught on film admitting to another contestant that she did not like Chinese people or black people, drawing accusations of racism. She immediately apologized for her comments.Following her win in the competition, Prikhodko was signed to a contract by Ukrainian music producer Konstantin Meladze, who was a frequent guest on Fabrika Zvyozd. She has gone on to state that she did not enjoy being on reality television, and that her only friend during the experience was a member of the production crew. She released several singles in 2007, none of which managed to gain massive mainstream attention.


=== 2008–2013: Eurovision and Zazhdalas ===
In 2008, Prikhodko released the single ""Bezotvetno"", a duet with Meladze's brother Valery Meladze. ""Bezotvetno"" went on to become Prikhodko's breakout hit, reaching the top forty in Russia. In January 2009, Prikhodko took part in the Ukrainian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. After frequent changes in plans, the Ukrainian competition was split into two rounds: a non-televised 30-song semi-final and a televised 15-song final. Prikhodko competed in the non-televised semi-final on 8 February 2009 with the song ""Za tebe znov"". After the semi-final ended, it was revealed that Prikhodko had not qualified to the final. Prikhodko responded to the results by stating that the Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC was not transparent in the selection of the finalists, calling their integrity into question. It later emerged that Prikhodko had not performed ""Za tebe znov"" in the semi-final, and was actually disqualified from the competition for performing the non-competing song ""Vsyo dlya tebya"". Prikhodko and her management stated that they were under the impression that the semi-final was simply a showcase of vocal capabilities, and that performing the potential Eurovision entry was not required. Prikhodko launched a formal complaint against the broadcaster for their handling of the event; their complaint was supported by Meladze in addition to the Ukrainian singers Sofia Rotaru, Mykola Mozhovyy, and Tina Karol. As a result of her complaint, the televised final was postponed by a Kyiv court. The court later ruled in Prikhodko's favor, but she allowed the televised final to go ahead.

Following the controversy with the Ukrainian national selection, Prikhodko instead applied for the Russian national final. The final's 15 competitors had already been decided, and Prikhodko's addition as an extra 16th competitor was controversial. After performing the song ""Mamo"", a bilingual entry in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages, she won the competition on 7 March 2009, winning both the public vote and jury vote. Following her win, allegations of vote rigging amongst the jury members arose, in addition to others complaining about a song in the Ukrainian language representing Russia in an international competition. Nevertheless, she remained the Russian representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow. Prikhodko became the second ever non-Russian to represent Russia in the competition; the first was Natalia Podolskaya, a Belarusian who represented Russia in 2005. As Russia was the host nation, Prikhodko was not required to compete in the semi-finals, and advanced directly to the final held on 16 May 2009. Her performance featured Prikhodko performing the song with a video of herself singing in the background, as she digitally aged from 20 to 70 years old. She ultimately placed eleventh in the competition, receiving a total score of 91 points.  ""Mamo"" has gone on to become Prikhodko's most successful single.After Eurovision, Prikhodko ended her professional partnership with Meladze in 2010. She subsequently began working with producer Igor Goncharenko that May, and has also worked with her elder brother Nazar. Later that year, she entered the Ukrainian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. Her entry was ""Action"", a techno song sung in English, a large departure from the previous folk rock music she had become known for. Prikhodko advanced from the fourth heat on 14 November 2010 as one of the three jury qualifiers. After advancing from the second semi-final on 12 December 2010 as well, she placed eighth in the final on 26 February 2011. Prikhodko's debut studio album Zazhdalas was released the following year.


=== 2014–2018: Pro-Ukrainian activity, Ya vilna, and retirement ===
Following the beginning of Euromaidan in 2014, and the subsequent pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Russian military intervention, and Russian annexation of Crimea, Prikhodko became an outspoken advocate of Ukrainian sovereignty and support towards Ukrainian liberation from Russian influence. During Euromaidan, Prikhodko performed at Maidan Nezalezhnosti and spoke in favor of European integration of Ukraine. In July 2014, Prikhodko went on tour with other Ukrainian musicians to support the Ukrainian Ground Forces during the War in Donbass. While on tour, Prikhodko posted on her Twitter account that Russians were ""puppets"", ""narrow-minded"", and ""deaf"". The following month, Prikhodko accused Russia of illegally occupying Ukrainian territory, and vowed to never perform another concert in Russia. Later in August, Prikhodko was profiled in the program 17 Friends of the Junta on Russian television channel NTV, which targeted critics of Russia's actions in Ukraine; the program was seen as a smear campaign. It depicted Prikhodko as an anti-Russian rebel, and included an interview with her estranged paternal grandmother who described her as a shame to the family, and Russian singer Joseph Kobzon stating that her Eurovision performance was disgraceful and that Prikhodko was a ""street girl who swears like a prostitute"". Prikhodko denounced the program, referring to it as ""laughable"". In 2015, Prikhodko revealed that refusing to perform concerts in Russia had been a major financial burden on her, as that was where a majority of her live performances were taking place and a large source of her income.In 2015, Prikhodko vowed to begin prioritizing the Ukrainian language in her music, and that she would no longer perform in Russian. She went on to claim that this decision had cost her popularity, as Russian is the dominant language of the music industry throughout most of the post-Soviet states. In 2016, Prikhodko was announced as a competitor in the Ukrainian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016, the inaugural edition of the Vidbir competition. Prikhodko competed in the first semi-final on 6 February 2016 with the song ""I Am Free Now"". She placed seventh in the semi-final, and did not qualify to the final. Her second studio album Ya vilna was later released that year. On 16 October 2018, Prikhodko announced through her Facebook that she had decided to end her musical career in order to enter politics.


=== Artistry ===
Prikhodko has become known for her deep contralto vocal range. Due in part to her training as a folk vocalist, Prikhodko's repertoire consists of songs often in a minor key, inspired by genres such as folk rock and pop music. Initially, many of her songs were performed in the Russian language; she later began incorporating the Ukrainian language into her music, until swearing off performing in Russian completely in 2015. She has also performed in English. Prikhodko composes some of her music herself, but often collaborates with other songwriters and producers. She plays the flute, guitar, and piano; Prikhodko has described the latter of the three as her favorite instrument. She pays close attention to criticism of her work, often trying to incorporate critiques and improve herself based on others' criticism.


== Political career ==
While active in the 2014 Euromaidan demonstrations, Prikhodko continuously stated that she was not interested in pursuing a career as a politician, instead preferring working as a musician and an activist. In 2015, Prikhodko identified herself with the Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko.In October 2018, after announcing her retirement from music, Prikhodko revealed that she had registered with the All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland"" political party led by Yulia Tymoshenko, and would be pursuing a career in politics. She added that she was interested in seeking election to the Verkhovna Rada during the next parliamentary election. After the announcement of the July 2019 snap election, Prikhodko confirmed that she would run for parliament as a member of the Fatherland party, standing for election in one of the Ukrainian electoral constituencies, and confirmed that if she did not win a seat in parliament, she would still remain politically active and perhaps seek office again in the future. Prikhodko ultimately stood in the eleventh electoral district of Vinnytsia and did not win a seat in parliament; she placed eighth with 4.44% of the vote.


== Personal life ==
Prikhodko has been married twice. Her first husband was Abkhazian businessman Nurik Kukhilava. They first split-up in 2011, later reconciled, and divorced in 2013. They had one daughter together. In 2013, she married an ex-schoolmate of hers named Alexander. They have a son together, born in 2015.

7,"Ruthenia is an exonym, originally used in Medieval Latin, as one of several terms for Kievan Rus'. It is also used to refer to the East Slavic and Eastern Orthodox regions of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, corresponding to what is now Belarus and Ukraine. Historically, the term was used to refer to all the territories of the East Slavs.The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (1772–1918), corresponding to parts of Western Ukraine, was referred to as Ruthenia and its people as Ruthenians. As a result of a Ukrainian national identity gradually dominating over much of present-day Ukraine in the 19th and 20th centuries, the endonym Rusyn is now mostly used among a minority of peoples on the territory of the Carpathian Mountains, including Carpathian Ruthenia.


== Etymology ==

The word Ruthenia originated as a Latin designation of the region its people called Rus'. During the Middle Ages, writers in English and other Western European languages applied the term to lands inhabited by Eastern Slavs.
Russia itself was called Great Ruthenia or White Ruthenia until the end of the 17th century.
""Rusia or Ruthenia"" appears in the 1520 Latin treatise Mores, leges et ritus omnium gentium, per Ioannem Boëmum, Aubanum, Teutonicum ex multis clarissimis rerum scriptoribus collecti by Johann Boemus. In the chapter De Rusia sive Ruthenia, et recentibus Rusianorum moribus (""About Rus', or Ruthenia, and modern customs of the Rus'""), Boemus tells of a country extending from the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea and from the Don River to the northern ocean. It is a source of beeswax, its forests harbor many animals with valuable fur, and the capital city Moscow (Moscovia), named after the Moskva River (Moscum amnem), is 14 miles in circumference.
Danish diplomat Jacob Ulfeldt, who traveled to Russia in 1578 to meet with Tsar Ivan IV, titled his posthumously (1608) published memoir Hodoeporicon Ruthenicum
(""Voyage to Ruthenia"").


== Early Middle Ages ==
European manuscripts dating from the 11th century used the name Ruthenia to describe Rus', the wider area occupied by the early Rus' (commonly referred to as Kievan Rus'). This term was also used to refer to the Slavs of the island of Rügen or to other Baltic Slavs, whom 12th-century chroniclers portrayed as fierce pirate pagans—even though Kievan Rus' had converted to Christianity by the 10th century: Eupraxia, the daughter of Rutenorum rex Vsevolod I of Kiev, had married the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV in 1089. After the devastating Mongolian occupation of the main part of Ruthenia which began in the 13th century, western Ruthenian principalities became incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after which the state became called the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia. The Polish Kingdom also took the title King of Ruthenia when it annexed Galicia. These titles were merged when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed. A small part of Rus' (Transcarpathia, now mainly a part of Zakarpattia Oblast in present-day Ukraine), became subordinated to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century. The Kings of Hungary continued using the title ""King of Galicia and Lodomeria"" until 1918.


== Late Middle Ages ==
By the 15th century, the Moscow principality had established its sovereignty over a large portion of Ruthenian territory and began to fight with Lithuania over the remaining Ruthenian lands. In 1547, the Moscow principality adopted the title of The Great Principat of Moscow and Tsardom of the Whole Rus and claimed sovereignty over ""all the Rus'"" — acts not recognized by its neighbour Poland. The Muscovy population was Eastern Orthodox and preferred to use the Greek transliteration Rossiya (Ῥωσία) rather than the Latin ""Ruthenia"".
In the 14th century, the southern territories of Rus', including the principalities of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev, became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which in 1384 united with Catholic Poland in a union which became the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. Due to their usage of the Latin script rather than the Cyrillic script, they were usually denoted by the Latin name Ruthenia. Other spellings were also used in Latin, English, and other languages during this period. Contemporaneously, the Ruthenian Voivodeship was established in the territory of Galicia-Volhynia and existed until the 18th century.
These southern territories include:

Galicia–Volhynia or the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (Ukrainian: Галич-Волинь, romanized: Halych-Volyn or Галицько-Волинське королівство, Halytsko-Volynske korolivstvo; Polish: Ruś Halicko-Wołyńska or Księstwo halicko-wołyńskie)
Galicia (Ukrainian: Галич, romanized: Halych or Галицько-Волинська Русь, Halytsko-Volynska Rus; Polish: Ruś Halicka)
White Ruthenia, (eastern part of modern Belarus; Belarusian: Белая Русь, romanized: Belaia Rus; Polish: Ruś Biała)
Black Ruthenia (a western part of modern Belarus; Belarusian: Чорная Русь, romanized: Chornaia Rus Polish: Ruś Czarna)
Galicia, or Red Ruthenia, western Ukraine and southeast Poland; Ukrainian: Червона Русь, romanized: Chervona Rus; Polish: Ruś Czerwona)
Carpathian Ruthenia (Ukrainian: Карпатська Русь, romanized: Karpatska Rus; Polish: Ruś Podkarpacka, lit. 'Subcarpathian Ruthenia')The Russian Tsardom was officially called Velikoye Knyazhestvo Moskovskoye (Великое Княжество Московское), the Grand Duchy of Moscow, until 1547, although Ivan III (1440–1505, r. 1462–1505) had earlier borne the title ""Great Tsar of All Russia"".


== Early modern period ==
During the early modern period, the term Ruthenia started to be mostly associated with the Ruthenian lands of the Polish Crown and the Cossack Hetmanate. Bohdan Khmelnytsky declared himself the ruler of the Ruthenian state to the Polish representative Adam Kysil in February 1649.The Grand Principality of Ruthenia was the project name of the Cossack Hetmanate integrated into the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth.


== Modern period ==


=== Ukraine ===
The use of the term Rus/Russia in the lands of Rus' survived longer as a name used by Ukrainians for Ukraine. When the Austrian monarchy made the vassal state of Galicia–Lodomeria into a province in 1772, Habsburg officials realized that the local East Slavic people were distinct from both Poles and Russians and still called themselves Rus. This was true until the empire fell in 1918.In the 1880s through the first decade of the 20th century, the popularity of the ethnonym Ukrainian spread, and the term Ukraine became a substitute for Malaya Rus' among the Ukrainian population of the empire. In the course of time, the term Rus became restricted to western parts of present-day Ukraine (Galicia/Halych, Carpathian Ruthenia), an area where Ukrainian nationalism competed with Galician Russophilia. By the early 20th century, the term Ukraine had mostly replaced Malorussia in those lands, and by the mid-1920s in the Ukrainian diaspora in North America as well.Rusyn (the Ruthenian) has been an official self-identification of the Rus' population in Poland (and also in Czechoslovakia). Until 1939, for many Ruthenians and Poles, the word Ukrainiec (Ukrainian) meant a person involved in or friendly to a nationalist movement.


=== Modern Ruthenia ===

After 1918, the name Ruthenia became narrowed to the area south of the Carpathian Mountains in the Kingdom of Hungary, also called Carpathian Ruthenia (Ukrainian: карпатська Русь, romanized: karpatska Rus, including the cities of Mukachevo, Uzhhorod, and Prešov) and populated by Carpatho-Ruthenians, a group of East Slavic highlanders. While Galician Ruthenians considered themselves Ukrainians, the Carpatho-Ruthenians were the last East Slavic people who kept the historical name (Ruthen is a Latin form of the Slavic rusyn). Today, the term Rusyn is used to describe the ethnicity and language of Ruthenians, who are not compelled to adopt the Ukrainian national identity.
Carpathian Ruthenia (Hungarian: Kárpátalja, Ukrainian: Закарпаття, romanized: Zakarpattia) became part of the newly founded Hungarian Kingdom in 1000. In May 1919, it was incorporated with nominal autonomy into the provisional Czechoslovak state as Subcarpathian Rus'. Since then, Ruthenian people have been divided into three orientations: Russophiles, who saw Ruthenians as part of the Russian nation; Ukrainophiles, who like their Galician counterparts across the Carpathian Mountains considered Ruthenians part of the Ukrainian nation; and Ruthenophiles, who claimed that Carpatho-Ruthenians were a separate nation and who wanted to develop a native Rusyn language and culture.In 1938, under the Nazi regime in Germany, there were calls in the German press for the independence of a greater Ukraine, which would include Ruthenia, parts of Hungary, the Polish Southeast including Lviv, the Crimea, and Ukraine, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. (These calls were described in the French and Spanish press as ""troublemaking"".)On 15 March 1939, the Ukrainophile president of Carpatho-Ruthenia, Avhustyn Voloshyn, declared its independence as Carpatho-Ukraine. On the same day, regular troops of the Royal Hungarian Army occupied and annexed the region. In 1944 the Soviet Army occupied the territory, and in 1945 it was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR. Rusyns were not an officially recognized ethnic group in the USSR, as the Soviet government considered them to be Ukrainian.
A Rusyn minority remained, after World War II, in eastern Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). According to critics, the Ruthenians rapidly became Slovakized. In 1995 the Ruthenian written language became standardized.Following Ukrainian independence and dissolution of the Soviet Union (1990–91), the official position of the government and some Ukrainian politicians has been that the Rusyns are an integral part of the Ukrainian nation. Some of the population of Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine have identified as Rusyn (or Boyko, Hutsul, Lemko etc) first and foremost; a subset of this second group has, nevertheless, considered Rusyns to be part of a broader Ukrainian national identity.


== Ruthenium ==
The Baltic German naturalist and chemist Karl Ernst Claus, member of the Russian Academy of Science, was born in 1796 in Dorpat (Tartu), then in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire, now in Estonia. In 1844, he isolated the element ruthenium from platinum ore found in the Ural Mountains and named it after Ruthenia, which was meant to be the Latin name for Russia.

10,"Nadiya Viktorivna Savchenko (Ukrainian: Надія Вікторівна Савченко; born 11 May 1981) is a Ukrainian politician, former Army aviation pilot in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and  former People's Deputy of Ukraine.During the 2014 War in Donbas Savchenko, a first lieutenant in the Ukrainian Ground Forces, served as instructor with a volunteer infantry unit, the Aidar Battalion. In June 2014, she was captured by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and handed over to Russia where she was accused of having directed artillery fire that killed two Russian state-television journalists at the positions of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.She was subsequently charged and convicted of murder and illegally crossing the Russian state border despite being abducted from Ukrainian territory one hour before the deaths of the journalists. One of her lawyers, Mark Feygin, said she was a prisoner-of-war and called on the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to demand her immediate release and that of the other Ukrainian POWs lest Russia be held in violation of the Geneva Conventions. European Union ministers and their representative regarded her detention as illegal and that her trial did not respect basic human rights, including the right to fair proceedings.In November 2014, while still imprisoned, Savchenko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, and she formally resigned from her military post. On 25 May 2016, Savchencko was exchanged in a prisoner swap for Russian GRU officers Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov captured by Ukraine.After returning to Ukraine, Savchenko declared her intention to participate as a presidential candidate in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. However, she was arrested on 22 March 2018, charged with planning a terrorist attack to overthrow the Ukrainian government. She was released from detention on 15 April 2019.Savchenko was one of Ukraine's first women to train as a military aeroplane pilot, and is the only female aviator to pilot the Sukhoi Su-24 bomber and the Mil Mi-24 helicopter.


== Life and military career ==
Nadiya Savchenko and her younger sister Vira were born in Kyiv in the Troieshchyna neighbourhood. Their father was an agricultural engineer, their mother a designer and cargo manager. Savchenko's father was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while her mother was an anti-communist. Her mother and sister Vira said in an interview that she and her sister were brought up in a Ukrainian-speaking household and attending Ukrainian-language schools.At 16, Savchenko was already determined to become a pilot. She joined the Ukrainian Army, working as a radio operator with the country's railway forces before training as a paratrooper. She was then the only Ukrainian female soldier in the (2004–2008) Ukrainian peacekeeping troops in Iraq. Upon returning, she successfully petitioned the Defence Ministry for the right to attend the prestigious Air Force University in Kharkiv, which until then had been open only to men; she was expelled twice during her study there as an unsuitable candidate to train as a pilot but both times was successfully re-instated and continued to train as a flight navigator instead, initially as a SU-24 navigator. Later she graduated on a Mi-24 attack helicopter in 2009 and served in the 3rd Regiment of the Army Aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city of Brody. She amassed 170 flying hours as a Mi-24 navigator.In 2011, the Ukraine Defence Forces published a 20-minute documentary about Savchenko and her military career. She also featured in a United Nations Development Program as part of a drive to promote equality in the Ukrainian military. Savchenko found her time in Brody boring and often got drunk. She was unhappy flying on the Mi-24 attack helicopter, instead of the Su-24 bomber. Her former commanding officer at Brody, Edward Zahurskiy, described her as a problem officer, who was unstable, insubordinate, and lacked discipline.In December 2013, Savchenko's 3rd Army Aviation Regiment was ordered to Kyiv by President Viktor Yanukovych. Savchenko then (without permission from her commanding officer) joined the Euromaidan demonstrations. Savchenko kept a low profile during the protests; there is a video of her trying to persuade demonstrators not to throw petrol bombs at riot police. After the president had fled Ukraine in late February 2014, Savchenko and her unit returned to Brody.Angry over her unit not being deployed in the war in Donbas, Savchenko defied orders and left Brody, and she volunteered as an instructor in the Aidar Battalion.


== Capture by Donbas People's Militia ==
During the war in Donbas, Savchenko fought as a volunteer in the east of Ukraine in the Aidar Battalion. On 17 June 2014, at 10:46 am she was captured near the village of Metalist, Slovianoserbsk Raion, by members of the Zarya Battalion, an armed pro-Russian militant group that declared allegiance to the self-declared People's Republic of Luhansk. On 19 June, a video of her interrogation at an undisclosed location appeared on the internet; she was shown handcuffed to a metal pipe. On 20 June, the chief of counter-intelligence Vladimir Gromov said that Savchenko was being treated well. On 22 June, there were media reports that Savchenko had been transferred to Donetsk.


== Detention and trial in the Russian Federation ==

On 8 July 2014, there were media reports that Nadiya Savchenko was being kept in a detention centre in city of Voronezh, the Russian Federation. On 9 July, Vladimir Markin, spokesman for Russia's Investigative Committee (a federal agency subordinate to the Russian President), confirmed that Savchenko was indeed held in Voronezh where she was facing charges of complicity in the 17 June killing of two Russian journalists, Igor Kornelyuk (a correspondent for All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company), and sound producer Anton Voloshin, who died during a mortar attack on a rebel checkpoint outside Luhansk. Ukrainian officials said the reporters did not comply with safety requirements and were not accredited. According to Savchenko's defence team, she was alibied by the billing data for Savchenko's and Kornelyuk's mobile phones, provided by Ukrainian Security Service, as she had already been captured by the Russian-backed separatists one hour before the mortar attack that killed the Russian journalists.Since late 2015, Russia's Investigative Committee insisted she crossed the border voluntarily without documents, and in the guise of a refugee. This contradicted previously published evidence and media reports: long before the alleged crossing, Russia's pro-Kremlin TV channel NTV reported that Savchenko had been captured by ""rebels"" and then handed over to the Russian authorities. Ukrainian officials said she had been illegally taken to Russia by Russian intelligence services in collaboration with pro-Russian rebels. In 2016, journalist Semen Zakruzhnyi followed the Investigative Committee's alleged route pointing out to numerous inconsistencies and concluding that neither Savchenko nor Russian investigators ever visited the places mentioned in the indictment.Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strong protest against the illegal transfer of Savchenko to Russia, calling the kidnapping of the Ukrainian citizen an act of state terrorism. On 8 July, President Petro Poroshenko instructed the General Prosecutor of Ukraine to take all measures to bring about Savchenko's release. In response, Vladimir Markin at Russia's Investigative Committee claimed that Savchenko was a terrorist and that the chances of her being released were on a par with those of Petro Poroshenko replacing Barack Obama as President of the United States.
During her long trial in Russia, Savchenko has been held in a cage—which is standard practice in Russia for defendants held without bail, despite the European Court of Human Rights ruling that defendants should never be held in a cage in the courtroom.On 10 July, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a website statement that her detention and trial is ""A violation of all international agreements, all norms of law and is unacceptable."" President Poroshenko emphasized that ""Nadiya Savchenko is a symbol of the struggle for Ukraine. While in captivity she has demonstrated the true, strong, martial Ukrainian spirit of a serviceman who doesn't betray the Motherland."" The President also said he had ordered a new lawyer for Savchenko.
As of 11 July 2015, Savchenko's Russian defence lawyer is Mark Feygin, who is known for his defence of Pussy Riot. On 27 August 2014, during a hearing at the Sovetsky district court of Voronezh, Savchenko appeared wearing a T-shirt with the Ukrainian state symbol (Tryzub) and spoke exclusively in the Ukrainian language. She also stated that she had been detained in Russia since 24 June, not 30 June as the Russian investigation reported. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court extended Savchenko's detention for a further two months and ordered that she be sent for a month to the Serbsky Institute for a forensic psychological evaluation, which Savchenko opposed.On 22 December 2014, Moscow City Court upheld the decision to extend the arrest of Savchenko until the end of the investigation, which was scheduled to be concluded by 13 February 2015. Savchenko subsequently began a hunger strike. The European Union and the United States have condemned Savchenko's detention and have called for her release. Her lawyer, Mark Feygin, said she was a prisoner-of-war.Savchenko officially became a Ukrainian delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, or PACE, on 26 January 2015; thus on a legal level, she obtained parliamentary immunity in all PACE signatory states, including Russia, from that date. Despite this she was not released. Aleksey Pushkov of the Russian Duma stated that her appointment to PACE was an attack against Russia, and that gaining diplomatic immunity does not absolve one from previous crimes. However, the Russian delegation to PACE struck a different tone, stating that it ""fully supports the release of Nadia Savchenko."" PACE has declined to strip Savchenko of her parliamentary immunity, and instead has stated that Savchenko must be immediately released, finding her 2014 abduction and subsequent imprisonment to be ""a violation of international law amounting to her de facto kidnapping"".On 2 March 2015, President Petro Poroshenko awarded Savchenko with the title of Hero of Ukraine.On 24 July 2015, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee of Russia, contrary to the information of Savchenko's capture published earlier by Donetsk People's Republic, stated that she voluntarily crossed the Russian border with intention of committing acts of sabotage and freely moved on the territory of Voronezh Oblast until 30 June when she was arrested.In February 2016, the US State department's spokesperson Jen Psaki voiced deep concern over the continued ill-treatment and deteriorating health of Savchenko, and called on Russia to honour its commitments under the September 2014 Minsk agreements, and the 15 February implementation plan by immediately releasing Savchenko and other Ukrainian hostages. Other urges to release her followed.On 7 March 2016, US Secretary of State John Kerry protested about Savchenko's continued detention, specifically mentioning concerns about her interrogations, solitary confinement, and forced ""psychiatric evaluation"".
In March 2016, Savchenko wrote: ""It is an absurd situation when those who abduct people and subject them to torture then act as if they have a right to judge them! How can one talk about a fair trial? In Russia, there are no trials or investigations—only a farce played out by Kremlin puppets. [...] those in the world with democratic values ought to learn their history lessons before it's too late and remember that there was a time when Europe was tolerant toward Hitler, and America wasn't decisive enough, and this led to World War II.""On 10 March 2016, while on a hunger strike, Nadiya Savchenko made a last statement to the court, which included the statement: ""I admit no guilt and I recognize neither the court nor the verdict. If I am found guilty, I will not appeal. I want the entire democratic world to understand that Russia is a Third World country with a totalitarian regime and a petty tyrant for a dictator and it spits on international law and human rights.""According to her lawyer Mark Feygin, ""her case will certainly be decided in Kremlin by Putin and his associates"". On 21 March 2016, the court of Donetsk, Russia found Savchenko guilty of illegally crossing the Russian border and the murder of two Russian journalists.Savchenko was freed in a prisoner swap on 25 May 2016 for two Russian servicemen. She was released from custody in Rostov-on-Don and immediately on a presidential flight brought to Boryspil. Technically, she was granted a pardon by president Vladimir Putin. Immediately in the Boryspil International Airport she was awarded the Golden Star and received an honorary title of Hero of Ukraine.


=== Public image ===
Savchenko's trial caused a significant response inside Ukraine, Russia and internationally.After news of her arrest was reported on 19 June, Savchenko became the subject of an impassioned Ukrainian social media campaign portraying her as a national hero. This social media campaign used the hashtag #SaveOurGirl (that mid-July 2014 had generated more than 15,000 tweets); apparently inspired by the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls used in the May 2014 Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping social media worldwide campaign.According to BBC News, Savchenko is portrayed extremely negatively in the media of Russia: ""Crude, and at times sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko"". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko is known as a ""killing machine in a skirt"", and Tvoy Den called her ""Satan's daughter"". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that ""not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman."" In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, ""However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia"". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko ""a trophy prisoner"" had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an ""obvious stitch-up"" you could ""see the threads"".When Savchencko was released from Russian prison in May 2016, opinion polls for the Ukrainian presidential election showed 15% would vote for her; by early 2017, this number was below 5%.


== Political career ==
In the October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Savchenko was placed first on the party list of Batkivshchyna. (In a June 2016 interview with Radio Free Europe, she stated that the party wasn't her first choice, but it ""isn't the worst""). In this same election, her sister Vira Savchenko was also a candidate for Batkivshchyna in an electoral constituency in Yahotyn. Nadiya Savchenko was elected as a deputy to the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament of Ukraine, as a result of the election. Because of this Savchenko resigned from the Ukrainian army on 7 November 2014. The Russian government has recognized the elections of Ukraine, meaning that the Russian Federation was holding a member of parliament from another nation under arrest. Vira Savchenko finished third in her constituency with 7.02% of the votes (winner Serhiy Mishchenko won 40.41%) and was thus not elected.In late November 2014, Savchenko signed her parliamentary oath and passed it to Ukraine through her lawyer and was thus sworn in as People's Deputy of Ukraine (MP) on 27 November 2014.On 25 December 2014, Savchenko was included in Ukraine's quota for representatives in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE); as noted above, legally this granted her parliamentary immunity in all PACE signatory nations, including Russia.On 6 November 2015, Savchenko's first draft law was introduced to Ukrainian parliament, while she was imprisoned in Russia, and implemented later.
On 27 May 2016, after returning from Russia in a prisoner exchange, Savchenko said she was prepared to become President of Ukraine if the Ukrainians wish so.In 2016, Savchenko left Batkivshchyna, but remained a member of its parliamentary faction. This was announced on 12 December 2016 right after Savchenko had admitted she had recently held a secret meeting with separatist leaders Aleksandr Zakharchenko (of the Donetsk People's Republic) and Igor Plotnitsky (of the Luhansk People's Republic) in Minsk. On 15 December 2016, Batkivshchyna expelled Savchenko from its parliamentary faction in response to her Minsk meeting with Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky. The party saw this meeting as ""negotiations with terrorists"" and ""adamantly opposed"" it. Following this controversy, the Ukrainian parliament stripped Savchenko of her PACE membership on 22 December 2016. On 27 December 2016, Savchenko established the Civic Platform RUNA (an acronym for Ukrainian People's Revolution). According to Savchenko RUNA will not be a ""political project"" but rather a ""mechanism"" and a ""natural association of people"" who do not follow ""populist slogans."" In July 2017, her new political party ""Social and Political Platform of Nadiya Savchenko"" was officially registered. The same month she stated her intent to take part in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.On 15 March 2018, the Attorney General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko charged Savchenko with preparing a terrorist attack on the Ukrainian parliament. On 22 March 2018, parliament stripped Savchenko of her parliamentary immunity and allowed her arrest. The same day she was arrested on suspicion of planning an assault on the parliament and supporting a coup d'état. Savchenko said  she did not plan any terrorist attack, but instead talked with undercover Ukrainian government agent provocateurs who sought to discredit her. She was released from detention on 15 April 2019.Savchenko took part as a candidate in 2019 Ukrainian presidential elections and 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary elections, but she was not elected.

13,"Oksana Shachko (Ukrainian: Оксана Шачко; 31 January 1987 – 23 July 2018) was a Ukrainian artist and activist. Along with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko, she was one of the founders of the radical feminist activist group Femen, which publicly demonstrates in various countries against sexual exploitation, income inequality, and policies of the Roman Catholic Church, among other causes.


== Biography ==
Oksana Chatchko was born in Khmelnytsky, a typical Soviet town in the western part of Ukraine, in an Orthodox Christian family. Her parents both worked in a factory and when the Soviet Union collapsed, the factories closed and they both lost their jobs, in the context of a political and economic crisis.In 1995, at the age of 8, Chatchko joined the Nikosh school, normally intended for adults and renowned for its teaching of Orthodox iconography. She graduated from this school and her early artwork was exhibited in several collective exhibitions in Ukraine and in the United States. At the age of twelve, she started painting frescoes, working in the Orthodox church full-time. She then expressed the desire to join a convent and become a nun, but her mother and her family convinced her not to do so.Later, at the age of 14, she rejected the Orthodox Church and religion and became an atheist, believing that the Orthodox priests behave more like merchants than God's representatives. She continued to paint to earn a living.In 2000, she joined the free university of Khmelnytsky to study philosophy, which triggered a deep crisis of conscience. At this time, she started feeling upset about the lack of space devoted to women to express their ideas and their creativity. She founded with other students the ""Center for New Perspectives"", an organisation fighting against corruption and for student rights. At this point, she met  Anna Hutsol and Aleksandra Shevchenko. She later indicated in the documentary film I am Femen that this experience forged her political and philosophical conceptions, making her become an activist fighting for women's rights and freedom of expression.


== Activism ==
In 2008, together with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko, Shachko founded the feminist activist group FEMEN. The group initially protested about issues affecting women students but rapidly moved on to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women and against sex tourism in 2008. Initially, FEMEN gained attention by demonstrating while dressed in underwear: however, in August 2009, Shachko bared her breasts at a protest in Kiev. Since then, FEMEN activists have regularly protested topless and broadened their agenda to women's rights and civil rights in Ukraine and around the world.
Members of FEMEN, including Shachko, were detained on numerous occasions. Probably the worst episode happened in 2011, when a group of activists demanded the release of political prisoners in the Belarusian capital Minsk. Shachko and two other women were kidnapped by the Belarusian KGB, taken to a forest, made to strip, doused with oil and threatened with being set on fire.Shachko worked together with French writer Galia Ackerman who produced a history of FEMEN which was published by Calmann-Lévy in 2013. In 2014, the award-winning documentary film about Shachko, Je suis Femen (I am Femen) by filmmaker Alain Margot was released.
France granted her political refugee status in 2013, after several attacks by security forces connected to Vladimir Putin, a target of FEMEN protests along with the French Front National. She lived in Paris, working as a painter.


== Art ==
At the time of her death, Shachko was concentrating on her artworks, called Iconoclast: Orthodox icons painted in the traditional method, onto which she introduced transgressive details to confront religious dogma with feminist, political or humanist messages. Shachko had her first solo exhibition in Paris in May 2016.


== Death ==
Shachko was found dead in her apartment in Paris, France, on 23 July 2018. She was 31. Anna Hutsol told Ukrayinska Pravda that friends were awaiting an official report. It was reported that she hanged herself.Elle profiled Shachko on 1 February 2019. In that profile, they reported that she had made another attempt to hang herself several years earlier.

15,"Olexandra Shevchenko (Ukrainian: Олександра Шевченко) is a member of the Ukrainian radical feminist protest group FEMEN, which regularly demonstrates topless against manifestations of patriarchy, dictatorship, religion, and the sex industry.


== Early life ==
Shevchenko was born and grew up in Khmelnytskyi (in Ukraine).


== FEMEN ==
Anna Hutsol formed FEMEN in Kyiv on 10 April 2008, with her two friends from their hometown of Khmelnytskyi, Olexandra Shevchenko and Oksana Shachko. They initially protested about issues effecting women students, but rapidly moved on to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women. It was in late August 2009 that Oksana Shachko became the first member of the group to bare her breasts during a protest, but it was not until 2010 that this approach became the usual tactic in FEMEN demonstrations, justified on the grounds that without the media attention generated by topless protests their message would not be heard.In 2011, international news agencies started to pay more attention to this unusual group of Feminist protesters,In late 2011, Shevchenko, along with Inna Shevchenko and Jenia Kraizman, took their protest onto the international stage.

16,"Inna Shevchenko (Ukrainian: Інна Шевченко) is a Ukrainian feminist activist and the leader of international women's movement FEMEN, which often demonstrates topless against what they perceive as manifestations of patriarchy, especially dictatorship, religion, and the sex industry. Shevchenko has a higher profile than the other members of the group. She was the leader of the three FEMEN activists reputedly kidnapped and threatened by the Belarus KGB in 2011. She achieved attention in Ukraine by cutting with a chainsaw and then bringing down a 4-metre high Christian cross in central Kyiv in 2012.In 2013, Shevchenko was granted asylum in France, and now continues her activism by leading FEMEN France from a training base she has established in Paris.In July 2013, Olivier Ciappa, who together with David Kawena designed a new French stamp depicting Marianne, stated on Twitter that Shevchenko had been the main inspiration for the depiction.


== Early life ==
Inna Shevchenko was born in Kherson near the Black Sea, on 23 June 1990. Inna had a childhood 'like that of all girls. I was brought up as a typical Ukrainian, Slavic girl, and was taught not to shout or argue'. She was a 'patsanka' (tomboy) and was especially close to her father who was a military officer. She also has an older sister. The 2004 Orange Revolution opened her eyes to politics and in the TV shows which pitted journalists against politicians, she said the journalists 'looked more intelligent so I wanted to be one'.  She went to university at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv from 2008 until 2012 where she studied journalism and graduated with honours.  Her extracurricular activity as a leader of the student government gave her political connections that helped land her a job in 2009 working for the Mayor's press office in Kyiv. Shevchenko's first language is Russian, although she is also fluent in Ukrainian, English and French.


== Activism & FEMEN ==


=== Early years in Ukraine ===
Shevchenko made contact with two leading FEMEN activists Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko (no relation) through the social networking site vKontakte and joined FEMEN early in 2009.  Anna Hutsol had formed FEMEN in Kyiv on 10 April 2008, with two friends, Alexandra Shevchenko and Oksana Shachko, from her hometown of Khmelnytskyi; they initially protested on issues affecting woman students, but rapidly moved to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women. Inna Shevchenko first demonstrated with FEMEN on 23 May 2009 in Kyiv, against prostitution and under the banner, ""Ukraine is not a Brothel"", in collaboration with DJ Hell.  Late in August 2009, Oksana Shachko became the first member of the group to bare her breasts during a protest; but not until 2010 did this become the usual tactic in FEMEN demonstrations, justified on the grounds that without the media attention generated by topless protests their message would not be heard.  In debates within FEMEN over the ethics of topless protest, Inna Shevchenko at first opposed the tactic, then was persuaded of its validity.  She was fired from her job in the Kyiv Mayor's press office after her arrest for taking part in a protest against the absence of women in Prime Minister Mykola Azarov's cabinet in December 2010, a decision which had angered her very much.


=== Asylum in France ===
On 8 September 2012, Shevchenko cut down wooden crosses at GOGBOT festival in Enschede, the Netherlands, as a protest on the arrest of Pussy Riot., following her cross-chainsawing action in Kyiv in August.

18 September 2012, Shevchenko established a training facility for FEMEN France in Paris. 26 October 2012, when Shevchenko was giving a live interview to the Arab television channel Al Jazeera, she was asked, ""Which is better for women, nudity or the paranja?""  She responded by taking off her T-shirt in protest at ""Medieval prejudices"".  The live picture was immediately cut. In July 2013, Shevchenko was granted asylum in France.Although Shevchenko has come to think of topless protest almost as a working uniform, she still has to overcome her reluctance to bare her breasts before each demonstration.In December 2012, the French magazine Madame Figaro included Shevchenko in its list of the world's top 20 iconic women of the year.In July 2013, Olivier Ciappa, who together with David Kawena designed a new French stamp depicting Marianne, stated on Twitter that Shevchenko had been the main inspiration for the depiction. The artist Olivier Ciappa who designed the 2013 image of Marianne on French stamps has stated that the portrait is a 'mixture of several women but particularly Inna Shevchenko'. On hearing this Inna tweeted 'All homophobes, extremists, fascists will have to lick my arse when they want to send a letter'.


=== Public speaking ===
Shevchenko is a speaker at conferences and a columnist for the international press. She was a speaker at a debate on the freedom of speech in Copenhagen on 14 February 2015 with cartoonist Lars Vilks. She was speaking about an illusion that in Western Europe people can fully enjoy freedom of speech when a terrorist opened fire in the lobby of the cultural centre, where the debates took place. Surviving the attack, Shevchenko later said, ""Liberal voices should be louder than Kalashnikovs.""
Shevchenko's TEDxKalamata talk is entitled ""I will not stop speaking out loud"".


=== Writing ===
Inna Shevchenko is a contributor for International press. She is a columnist for International Business Times Her articles were also published in The Guardian, The Huffington Post, and CNN. Together with other FEMEN activists, Shevchenko wrote FEMEN: Manifeste and Rebellion
In 2017 Inna Shevchenko has published Anatomie de l'oppression (Anatomy of oppression) with Pauline Hillier in Edition du Seuil. The book touches on the responsibility of religious institutions and dogmas in the oppression of women. "" Every day, new words and measures against women are delivered in the Vatican, Mecca, Jerusalem, and in synagogues, mosques and churches all around the world. Every day, women are despised, depreciated, soiled, wounded or killed. Every day, women that are hidden in public, locked up at home, deprived of education and prospects for their futures, forced to silence, humiliated, beaten, mutilated, whipped, stoned and burned, accompany us. We can no longer remain silent. The responsibility of religions in the misfortunes of the world crushes our screens and our eyes, but many still refuse to see their role in women's misfortunes. This book was written because we no longer wanted them to believe, but rather to know"", said the author.

She expressed her position in an article in TIME, noting, in particular, that ""without restoring the rule of law within its own organization, the UN will become more and more irrelevant, just as the League of Nations did when it failed to react to the Third Reich’s invasion of Poland in 1939.""

19,"Nelya Ihorivna Shtepa (Ukrainian: Неля Ігорівна Штепа; Russian: Не́ля И́горевна Ште́па, Nelia Igorevna Shtepa) is a Ukrainian politician. She was mayor of Sloviansk from 2010 until 2014, when Russian paramilitary troops occupied the city. She was imprisoned by the separatists because she refused to fully co-operate with them, freed by Ukrainian forces, but then imprisoned again by Ukrainian authorities for alleged collusion with the Donetsk People's Republic.


== Life ==
She was born as Nelya Ihorivna Lytvyn (Ukrainian: Неля Ігорівна Литвин) on 13 September 1960 in Sloviansk, then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Shtepa entered Sloviansk State Pedagogical Institute in 1979, and began her career as a teacher in 1984. She later held administrative positions, and became a headmistress. During these years, she was a member of the Communist Party. She began to work for Komsomol in 1987. From 1990, she worked in various enterprises as a sales director, and then in some charities. In the 2000s, she joined the Party of Regions. She was elected mayor of Sloviansk on 31 October 2010, winning more than 60% of the vote.


=== Mayor of Sloviansk during Siege of Sloviansk ===
Amidst rising unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine, separatist militants seized a police station in the city of Sloviansk on 13 April 2014. At the time of the seizure, Mayor Shtepa spoke in support of militants, saying that they were local residents, and that she agreed that a referendum on the status of the Donbas region should be held. On the same day, the Ukrainian government launched a military operation to reclaim government buildings occupied by pro-Russian militants across the region. As this operation began, Shtepa said that she did not actually support the separatists, and that their actions were ""an occupation"". She said that she had only pretended to support them, in an effort to free dozens of hostages held in Sloviansk city buildings that the separatists had seized. Separatist militant Vyacheslav Ponomarev declared himself ""people's mayor"" of Sloviansk on 14 April, apparently usurping Shetpa. On the following day, she said that the Sloviansk militants were ""green men"", a reference to the unmarked Russian soldiers that seized Crimea in the lead up to its annexation by Russia in February–March 2014. Two days later, she told journalists that many in her city desired more autonomy for the regional government, but that more than 75 percent of Sloviansk residents wanted to remain part of Ukraine.Nelya Shtepa disappeared on 18 April. At the time, Amnesty International reported that she had attempted to meet with Vyacheslav Ponomarev at the Sloviansk city administration building, and that she had likely been held captive by Ponomarev. In Shtepa's own description of what happened, revealed months later after her eventual release, militants entered her home late at night on 17 April. They forced her into a car, and took her to the city administration building. Ponomarev attempted to force Shtepa to sign a letter of resignation. She refused, and he then beat her into submission. Subsequently, she was forced to voice support for the separatists in a number of interviews with the Russian media, whilst being held captive in the basement of the city administration building.Shtepa was not seen in public again until Victory Day, when she appeared on stage in the city centre, looking well, giving a strongly pro-Russian speech, urging citizens of Sloviansk to vote in the upcoming referendum. 


=== After Siege of Sloviansk ===
After her appearance on May 9th, Shtepa was not seen in public again until 5 July 2014, when Ukrainian forces retook Sloviansk. She was then detained by members of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on 11 July for allegedly colluding with the separatists, taken to a prison in Kharkiv, and charged under articles 110 (violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine) and 258 (creation of a terrorist organisation) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The Kharkiv regional prosecutors' office announced on 31 October 2014 that it was seeking a sentence of life imprisonment. Amnesty International and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have expressed concerns about the fairness of the judicial proceedings against Shtepa. Journalist and Euromaidan activist Irma Krat, who was also held with Shtepa by Vyacheslav Ponomarev, has refuted the charges against Shtepa, and has volunteered to speak on her behalf. One of the main witnesses for Shtepa's defence, her deputy mayor, was abducted on 30 January 2015, and later found dead. This development was labelled ""concerning"" by an OHCHR report.
