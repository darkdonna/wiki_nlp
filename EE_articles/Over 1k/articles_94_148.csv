7,"Katalin Szili (born 13 May 1956) is a Hungarian politician and jurist, a former Member of the National Assembly, who served as Speaker of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2009.
Following an administrative career in the Hungarian People's Republic, she was a long-time member of the left-wing Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). She was Member of Parliament (MP) from 1994 to 2014, and was considered a leading politician of her party for a decade. After the 2014 election, she gradually became a proponent of the right-wing Fidesz government, voicing nationalist and anti-immigrant slogans.


== Early life ==
Katalin Szili was born into a family of bourgeois origin on 13 May 1956 in Barcs, Somogy County. Her maternal grandparents were ethnic Austrians. The family lost all their property during World War II, and her grandfather was killed in the Battle of Budapest in February 1945. Her father György Szili (1935–1987) worked as a commercial lecturer and her mother Anna Barakonyi (b. 1937) as an accountant. At the age of twelve, Katalin Szili lost her left hand as a result of an accident, when a grenade exploded in her hand. For this reason she wears shawls to cover her hands or pockets it in public. On ceremonial occasions, she usually wears an artificial hand that matches the color of her skin.She attended elementary school in Barcs and Pécs. She finished her secondary studies at the Nagy Lajos Secondary Grammar School of Pécs in 1974. She obtained a doctorate in law at the Janus Pannonius University in 1981. She passed the bar examination in 1985. She graduated from the Department of Human Ecology of the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) between 1990 and 1992, and also earned a degree in political science in Pécs in 2001. She married architect Miklós Molnár in 1977. They raised the two children of a couple of friends who died in a car accident and have no children of their own.


== Professional career ==
After graduating, she was responsible for guardianship at the local council of Pécs, and she was the head of a local guardianship authority from 1984 to 1985. Thereafter, she joined the South Transdanubian Water Directorate in 1985, first as a legal adviser and then as the head of an official department. After the transition to democracy, she was the head of the Environment and Water Directorate and then of the Environmental Inspectorate until 1992. She became a member of the leadership of the Hungarian Society of Human Ecologists in 1992.In 2003 she was elected the social president of the women's basketball department of the Pécsi VSK, she held the position until 2005. She became an honorary associate professor at the University of Pécs in 2008.


== Political career ==


=== MSZP ===
Szili joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) in 1983. She became a founding member of its legal successor, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) on 15 November 1989, and participated in the establishment of its local branch in Pécs. She ran as a candidate in the 1990 parliamentary election in Pécs (Constituency II, Baranya County), and finished third in the second round, while András Pap (MDF) obtained the mandate. She was elected to the municipal assembly of Pécs during a by-election in 1992.She was also nominated individual candidate in Pécs (Constituency II), but her name also appeared at the first place on the regional county list of MSZP during the 1994 parliamentary election. She obtained the mandate in the constituency, defeating Tibor Németh (SZDSZ) and András Pap (MDF). After Gyula Horn formed his MSZP–SZDSZ coalition government, she served as the secretary of state for political affairs in the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development (under minister Ferenc Baja) from 15 July 1994 to 7 July 1998. At that time she was also a member of the Council of the National Technical Development Committee (OMFB). She was elected chairperson of the local branch of her party in Pécs in 1997. A year later, she became president of the party's national women section.

Szili was re-elected MP for Pécs (Constituency II) in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 parliamentary elections. She served as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly between 1998 and 2002. Following the 2002 parliamentary election, Szili was elected Speaker of the National Assembly, becoming the second woman, who held the office. She was re-elected as Speaker in 2006.She was the candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party for presidency in the 2005 Hungarian presidential election. Szili lost the election on 7 June 2005 to opposition nominee László Sólyom. The Hungarian Constitution prescribes that the President must be elected by the National Assembly of Hungary, thus the victory of the opposition came as something of a surprise.  The junior coalition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), however, had long emphasized that it would not vote for a partisan President.  Szili as a high-ranking member of the Socialist party was considered partisan, the SZDSZ abstained, enabling the more neutral candidate Sólyom (who was originally nominated by a non-governmental organization Védegylet and later supported by the opposition), to win the office. Another reason for the failed nomination was that SZDSZ was not consulted ahead of time and Szili lacked qualifications compared to Sólyom who previously held high office as the president of the Constitutional Court of Hungary.
In 2009 Szili was the mayoral candidate of MSZP for the mayor of a major Hungarian city, Pécs. She lost the election to Zsolt Páva. She came to be considered inner opposition inside the MSZP since 2009 (some considered she had prominent role in the leakage of the Őszöd speech three years earlier). In 2009 Szili resigned from her position as speaker of Parliament, She was succeeded by Béla Katona of MSZP. She formed the Movement of Alliance for the Future in 2010 and had her own candidates in some areas in the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election. Szili was elected to the Parliament of Hungary via the Baranya County Party list where she was chairperson of the local MSZP branch.


=== Independent MP ===
After the 2010 local elections, held on 3 October, she founded the Social Union (SZU) and became its first chairperson. As a result, she quit the Hungarian Socialist Party and their parliamentary group, continuing her parliamentary work as a formally independent MP. However, as an elected parliamentarian she filled a four-year term ending in 2014. Thus the new party Social Union instantly had some representation in Parliament, which is usually not possible for parties having won less than 5% of votes.
In 2011 Szili became a member of the Nemzeti Konzultációs Testület (National Consultative body) preparing the new 
constitution. Later, she presented her own proposal. Szili was appointed Chairperson of the Committee on Sustainable Development on 25 February 2013.
On 17 October 2013, Szili and her party, the Social Union (SZU), entered into an alliance with 11 other parties and civil groups (including Centre Party) and established Community for Social Justice People's Party (KTI). Her new party did not reach the 5% threshold contrary in the 2014 parliamentary election, as a result she lost her parliamentary seat after 20 years.


=== Supporter of Viktor Orbán ===
Following the 2014 national election, Szili gradually switched to Fidesz, and became a vocational supporter of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who retained his two-third majority in the Hungarian parliament.

8,"Éva Tétényi (born 25 December 1961) is a Hungarian politician, who served as the mayor of Esztergom between 2010 and 2014. Tétényi formerly worked as an architect.


== Politics ==
She was born 25 December 1961 in Esztergom, Hungary. Before her political career, Tétényi worked as an architect. She was the chief architect of the 6th district of Budapest, and later the chief architect of Győr-Moson-Sopron County, and was the member of the executive board of the Architects' Council of Europe.
Tétényi ran for mayor of Esztergom during the 2010 municipal elections with several parties urging their voters to support Tétényi. Jobbik, Politics Can Be Different (LMP) and Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) were among those who provided such support. Tétényi, thanks to her broad support, was elected with two-thirds of the votes, against the Fidesz-supported Tamás Meggyes. As there was no similar agreement between the Tétényi supporting parties for city council (Jobbik, MSZP, LMP each ran separate candidates there), the election for city council was won by the Fidesz party, which holds two-thirds of the seats there. Tétényi is not a member of any political party.
Since in the Hungarian political system most of the power in local government was delegated to the council as opposed to one person mayoral rule, this caused constant conflict between the mayor and the council. The city council with votes from the Fidesz party illegally restricted the powers of the mayor, and her immediate co-workers were fired one by one.Tétényi several times proposed disbanding the council. Tétényi then announced violating the law, claiming it was her right as civil disobedience, and refused to chair the council meetings except for decisions about the debt settlement and the reorganization plan. With no vice-mayor present due to an earlier resignation and Tétényi's refusal to consent to the appointment of any new vice-mayors, this meant that there is nobody legally able to chair council meetings. This effectively had shut down the local government in Esztergom completely. The shutdown occurred at a time when the city was struggling to meet its financial obligations and a possible default would mean the loss of all properties owned by the city. Tétényi claimed the reason for her actions is the city council's inability to cooperate with her as the elected mayor. Tétényi remained highly popular among the citizens of Esztergom, she also won the election by a large margin.
During the June 2011 Tétényi made several demands such as the resignation of three members of the city council and the appointment of Jobbik politician Andrea Stámusz as vice mayor. These she said would help resolve the situation. A significant issue facing the city government was debt restructuring, with total debt reaching 25 bn HUF, caused by the previous mayor, Meggyes. In 2011 the companies owned by Esztergom wrote an open letter to Tétényi, publicly asking her to end the shutdown of the local government and call the city council together and chair the meetings. Several actions regarding their functioning such as review and acceptance of the balance sheet requires a council vote. The letter said they will regard Tétényi as personally responsible for the monetary and other damages (such as a possible violation of Cth law of 2000. on accounting). In July 2011 an LMP politician, Gergely Karácsony, proposed an election coalition between Jobbik-LMP-MSZP, to change certain laws enacted by Fidesz. He cited Éva Tétényi's case, as a precedent of how such a proposal could work.Tétényi ran for mayor of Esztergom during the 2014 municipal elections for the second time as an independent candidate. She was also supported by DK and Együtt–PM, however Jobbik had an own mayoral candidate in 2014. Éva Tétényi lost to Etelka Romanek (Fidesz–KDNP) and came to the second place with 43.39 percent of the votes.


== Controversy ==
In July 2011 Tétényi called his political opponents ""retards"". She also threatened physical violence against them, saying ""one by one you should be beaten"". Tétényi's words were recorded and played for the press. The statements caused controversy as they stepped across the usual boundaries of political discourse. The political opponents of Tétényi also received death threats at the time signed from the ""Man from Esztergom"". Tétényi didn't distance herself from the threats when asked to do so. Tétényi said that even though the discussion took place in a TV studio, it was after the end of the TV program, making her words part of a private conversation. Tétényi have asked the government to appoint a governmental overseer, to watch over the affairs of Esztergom.

== Leaving the PCRM and joining the PSRM ==
In autumn 2011, Zianida Greceanîi, together with Igor Dodon, left PCRM and joined the Party of Socialists (PSRM) led by Veronica Abramciuc. In 2011, the party leader became Igor Dodon and stayed in this position until 2016.  After the Republic of Moldova president election, the acting leader of the Party of Socialists became Zinaida Greceanîi, who on 18 December 2016 was officially elected as party chairman. At the elections of 30 November 2014 Zinaida Greceanîi was at the top position of the PSRM electoral list.

She was elected as 12th President of the Moldovan Parliament 8 June 2019, which sparked a brief 8-day constitutional crisis in the country.


== Controversies ==


=== Import of electricity ===
Zinaida Greceanîi and Igor Dodon were involved in a collusive import scheme of the electricity and became subject to a complaint filed to the Prosecutor General's Office. Since 1 June 2008 Moldova has purchased electricity from Ukraine at a price that was by 10% higher than that paid in May. First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Dodon announced the new price as a ""remarkable success"", reasoning that, initially, the Ukrainian side demanded a 50% increase. However, the Chișinău corridors were talking about the fact that the price increase was made for the benefit of a company registered in Hungary behind which would be persons delegated by the leadership of Moldova and Ukraine. Following the ""negotiations"", a private intermediary was included in the Ukrainian import scheme.  In the meantime, the energy experts have received more official information from ANRE, which showed that only one year ago the intermediary company got a profit of over 14.5 million dollars from the energy price difference. The Government was responsible for importing electricity. And according to a provision signed by then Prime Minister Zinaida Greceanîi, the negotiating group for the signing the electricity supply contract in Ukraine was composed by Igor Dodon, at that time the Minister of Economy, Alexandr Gusev, the Director of Energocom and Marcu Rimish, from Moldelectrica.


=== Credits from BEM ===
In 2008, Zinaida Greceanîi, was Minister of Finance, and her husband, Alexei, was the member of the Board of Directors of Vin Cojusna Factory, a company that took a credit from Banca de Economii (BEM) in the amount of 1.63 million Euro and US$500,000. For the Greceanîi family, was not a problem to get this loan, all the more so since the Ministry of Finance was responsible for the state's package of the BEM assets. Two years ago, in 2010, the Cojusna factory went bankrupt, and in 2011 a certain ""Alsvit-print"" firm, founded by an off-shore company controlled by Alexei Greceanîi, had bought the assets of the factory, pledged at the bank, with another credit of 40 million of MDL also contracted from BEM.
One year after the launch of the Bank of Economy liquidation process, the amounts that came from the sale of the assets and property of the bank are insignificant. The most precious batch auctioned is the Cojusna Wine Factory that came to court after Alexei Greceanîi, the husband of the former prime minister and the current Socialist leader Zinaida Greceanii, has not returned tens of millions of MDL.On 15 July 2019, the PL leader, Dorin Chirtoacă, presented several documents according to which it was shown that Zinaida Greceanii was involved in getting BEM's credits, which were not returned. He asked Zinaida Greceanii to resign from her position of President of the Moldovan Parliament, accusing her of implication in bank fraud.


=== Integrity ===
Before the parliamentary elections of 28 November 2010, the Civic Initiative for a Clean Parliament, which drew up a list of the candidates with integrity issues, noted that because of the Minister of Finance, Zinaida Greceanîi Moldova was convicted to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of  ""Offer Plus"" Company, which led the state to pay damages and outstanding debts to the company in the amount of 2.5 million Euro.
